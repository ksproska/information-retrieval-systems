Pretty in Pinkler. ,. The Shaft. ,. Patience Face. ,. Milkbone. , and. Ultrasaurus. .. . I know my buddy Bart \"the Crusher\" Paul did it way back in the day, but I am not sure if anyone else has. I'm assuming some of the prolific Flatiron's route developers such as Matt Samet have done this as well, but I am not really sure? Candidates for sending Jurassic Park should be really strong, really fit, or have the routes on total lockdown. I think this feat is rad enough that it merits a designation on Mountainproject. Fitness is the name of the game for Jurassic Park. Given that 4 of the 5 climbs are roughly 100 feet long, are pumpy, and all have redpoint cruxes near the top, I think doing all of them clean in a day is quite a challenge. My buddy Chris Taylor who was also trying to do \"Dino in a Day\" coined the term Jurassic Park, and it just kind of stuck. I would love to hear from others in the climbing community who have done this or tried. It would be very interesting to hear who did this first and what year it was. It's hard to quantify the difficulty of this accomplishment, but I would say that sending all 5 routes is somewhere in the solid 5.13 realm.. . Nonetheless, Jurassic Park should be on every strong climbers tick list! Enjoy the challenge, and don't get too pumped....",
