PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY\n\nThe flicker of film.   Footage from a press conference.\n\n                         GUIDO\n            You kill your film several times,\n            mostly by talking about it. A film is\n            a dream. You kill it writing it down,\n            you kill it with a camera; the film\n            might come to life for a moment or two\n            when your actors breathe life back\n            into it - but then it dies again,\n            buried in film cans. Mysteriously,\n            sometimes, in the editing room, a\n            miracle happens when you place one\n            image next to another so that when,\n            finally, an audience sits in the dark,\n            if you're lucky -- very lucky - and\n            sometimes I've been lucky - the dream\n            flickers back to life again. That's\n            why I'm secretive.\n\n                         REPORTER (O.S.)\n            So what's your favorite pasta?\n\n                         GUIDO\n            Finally, a serious question.\n\nLaughter.   A word:\n\n                        NINE\n\nINT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - NIGHT\n\nA huge soundstage. The STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT lets a\nman into the stage, turns on a working light.\n\nSUPERTITLE: Cinecitta film studios, Rome, 1965\n\n                         STUDIO SUPERINTENDENT\n            Good luck, Maestro.\n\nDeparting, he closes the soundstage door.\n\nAs the man crosses the shadowy stage, a dim shaft of\nlight catches his face, weary, handsome, haggard.\nGUIDO CONTINI, the most famous film director in the\nworld. In front of him:\n\nAN ENORMOUS, DUSTY, MULTI-LEVEL FILM SET under\nconstruction. A complex maze of scaffolding, its\nunfinished, chaotic elements suggesting ancient ruins.\nCracked stone facades, broken columns, open\nplatforming, the skeleton of a grand staircase.    A\nlighting grid, not yet hung, and a camera crane\nsurrounded by a forest of studio lights on stands.\n                                    p. 2\n\n\n\nGuido sits at the table, lights up a cigarette and puts\non his glasses. He looks at the plans, looks up at the\nstage, puts his glasses down and stands up, stepping\nover to the crane.\n\nGuido, alone, cigarette hanging from the corner of his\nmouth, contemplates the studio, its turbulent set, in\nevery sense a jumble of ideas.\n\nGuido looks at the set in despair. He sits in the\nbucket seat of the crane, buries his head in his hands,\noverwhelmed.\n\nTHE FIRST OF NINE LOUD CHURCH BELLS CHIMES\n\n                       GUIDO (V.O.)\n          Maestro, Maestro, Maestro Contini...\n          How do you begin? How do you begin\n          this thing? Page 1... Page 1... Page\n          1... Page nothing...\n\nIn the distance, a figure approaches out of the\ndarkness, the darkness of Guido's imagination. An\nescape from his tortured reality.\n\nThe figure emerges gradually, like a goddess. She is\ngorgeous, imposing, and seductive. She is CLAUDIA, his\nfilm star, his muse. When Claudia reaches Guido, she\nstops in front of him, takes his hands from his face,\nand kisses him. And with that gesture, the music\nswells, the lighting grid rises majestically into the\nair, the gritty soundstage transforms into something\nbeautiful, transforms into the interior world of\nGUIDO'S FANTASY.\n\nAs Claudia moves away, more and more women slowly\nappear. They emerge from everywhere. These are the\nwomen from Guido's life, past and present. Women from\nhis films, women he has loved, the sources of his\ninspiration and creative genius.\n\nA grand OVERTURE unfolds. The most significant women\nin Guido's life are revealed, each with their own\npowerful entrance:\n\nLUISA, his wife\n\nCARLA, his mistress\n\nLILLI, his costume designer and accomplice\n\nGUIDO'S MAMMA, her spirit\n\nSTEPHANIE, a fashion journalist\n\nSARAGHINA, a whore\n                                       p. 3\n\n\n\nA dark and glamourous dream. The women surround Guido\nand he loses himself and his anxiety in their\ncollective embrace.\n\n\nINT. STAGE 5, CINECITTA - DAY\n\nThe fantasy ends abruptly with A VIOLENT GRATING NOISE,\nas the studio's truck doors are yanked open, jolting\nGuido who is slumped in the crane seat. Harsh daylight\npenetrates the gloom. Too bright. He blinks,\ndiscombobulated, as a group of silhouetted figures\napproach with purpose. One of the figures is a well-\nfed, amiable character, DANTE. He is Guido's longtime\nassociate and Producer. A younger, more ascetic figure\naccompanies him, sharp and birdlike. This is FAUSTO, an\naccountant. Dante speaks quickly and without obvious\npunctuation:\n\n                       DANTE\n                 (walking)\n          Guido! You're here.\n\n                       GUIDO\n          Buongiorno, Dante.\n\n                       DANTE\n          I've been looking for you all over the\n          place. The set's coming along. How\n          are you?\n\n                       GUIDO\n          Bene, grazie, bene.\n\nGuido stands to greet him. They kiss on both cheeks.\n\n                       DANTE\n          Bene. My God, you look terrible,\n          better go to makeup, forget you've got\n          a press conference?\n\n                       FAUSTO\n                 (discreetly, to Dante)\n          He has no tie.\n\n                       DANTE\n          Yes, makeup and wardrobe.\n\nHe takes Guido's arm and they head towards daylight.\nGuido looks back at Fausto, who follows and with a look\nand a gesture asks Dante who is he?\n\n                       FAUSTO\n                 (overlapping Dante)\n          Signor Contini, I'm Fausto.     Good\n          morning, Signor Contini.\n                                       p. 4\n\n\n\n                       DANTE\n                 (interrupts)\n          He's counting costs, you know. The\n          Bank wants him here.\n                 (to Fausto)\n          Don't speak to him, I speak to him.\n\n                       FAUSTO\n          Okay, I have some questions for Signor\n          Contini.\n\n                       GUIDO\n          We all have questions for Signor\n          Contini.\n\nThey head outside.\n\n\nEXT. CINECITTA - DAY\n\nGuido, Dante and Fausto hurry through the studio en\nroute to the Production Offices. Behind them is a large\nposter of CLAUDIA, starring in Guido's last movie, a\nfailure, LA DONNA MODERNA (The Modern Woman). As Guido\npasses he causes a mild stir, and many people nod\ndeferentially, offer a Maestro, or Dottore. Guido nods.\n\n                       FAUSTO\n          Yes, but please, please, I think it's\n          customary for there to be an approved\n          script and budget before filming\n          commences...\n\n                       GUIDO\n          Is he going to follow us?\n\n                       FAUSTO\n          It's not my intention to be difficult.\n          Maestro, I am a huge admirer of\n          Maestro Contini's movies, your early\n          films are...everybody loves them\n          and... I consider it a great honour\n          for me to be here now... none the\n          less, I need a script and a budget.\n\nNeither Dante nor Guido respond. Fausto flounders.\nThey make their way to the Production Offices.\nEverywhere signs for the movie, ITALIA.\n\n\nINT. PRODUCTION OFFICES, CINECITTA - DAY\n\nA long corridor, bustling with activity. The trio\nheads down it. If a pretty girl goes by, and there are\nseveral, both Guido and Dante turn to look but without\nmissing a beat of their solemn conversation.\n                                       p. 5\n\n\nAs they progress into and through the open plan office,\nmany of the crew look up and cluster around, trying to\nget Guido's attention, swelling the procession,\ninterjecting with their urgent requests.\n\nThere are set models everywhere, in the process of\nbeing constructed, or painted.\n\nJACONELLI, Guido's production designer, looks up from a\nmodel, hurries over. Nobody stops moving.\n\nAs a pretty girl passes between them, they all turn to\nlook.\n\nPIERPAOLO, Guido's young PA, has caught up with the\nprocession. He has dozens of phone messages, sorting\nthrough them, as he walks alongside Guido, through a\npartitioned office -\n\n                       PIERPAOLO\n          Where do you want your messages?\n\n                        GUIDO\n          On my desk.\n\n                       PIERPAOLO\n          There's no room on your desk.\n\n- into the main office -\n\n                       GUIDO\n          Under my desk. In the trash. Non lo\n          so.\n\n                       PIERPAOLO\n                 (waving them at him)\n          Some of these are urgent!\n\n                       GUIDO\n                 (to Pierpaolo)\n          Get me a cigarette.\n\n                       JACONELLI\n                 (confidentially)\n          We will never be ready to shoot in ten\n          days.\n\n                        GUIDO\n          Jaconelli -\n\n                       FAUSTO\n                 (at the same time)\n          Not ready?!\n\n                       GUIDO\n                 (continues)\n          Ascolta me.\n                       (MORE)\n                                    p. 6\n\n                       GUIDO (CONT'D)\n                 (he kisses Jaconelli on\n                  the cheek)\n          Careful what you say. He's a spy from\n          the bank.\n\nGuido carries on moving through the office.\n\n                       DANTE\n          He's not exactly from the bank, Guido.\n\nNow BENITO, Guido's Casting Director, moves towards\nGuido, Guido tries to duck away from him as they head\ntowards Guido's office.\n\n                       BENITO\n          Dottore, Dottore. You have actors\n          waiting for you in your office.\n          Auditions all morning. You should see\n          what I've found. I found two sisters.\n          Look, they're right...\n\nGuido turns through another partition, as they all\nbesiege him with questions. Benito despairs.\n\n                       BENITO (CONT'D)\n          Dottore, this way...\n\nGuido heads towards Wardrobe, goes straight through the\ndoor, swinging it shut, leaving the chaos behind him.\n\nDante blocks Benito.\n\n                       BENITO (CONT'D)\n          Maestro!\n\n                       DANTE\n          Not now. He's got the Press\n          Conference.\n\n\nINT. WARDROBE, CINECITTA - DAY\n\nGuido comes through the door, blows hard from the\nbarrage.\n\nThey're in Lilli's domain here, and a haven, always,\nfor Guido. Part Edith Head, part Coco Chanel, Lilli is\nGuido's Costume Designer, no longer young, cranky,\nindomitable, sharp as a tack. She adores Guido without\nany sentiment. She's incapable of sentiment. Guido\nheads straight towards her desk, where she is cutting\nsome fabric.\n\n                       GUIDO\n          I need a cigarette.\n\nDante comes in, closing the door behind him.\n                                      p. 7\n\n\n\n                       DANTE\n          He needs a shirt and tie, Lilli.\n\nGuido sits up on Lilli's table, as Dante heads to\nLilli's desk and picks up the phone to make a call.\n\n                       GUIDO\n          I need a coffee and a cigarette.\n\nHe lies down.\n\n                       LILLI\n                 (unimpressed)\n          Answer a question, I'll give you a\n          coffee. Answer another question, I'll\n          give you a cigarette. And so on.\n\n                       GUIDO\n          Actually and an aspirin.\n\nDante stands at Lilli's desk and looks at some\ndrawings.\n\n                       DANTE\n                 (in the background, on the\n                  phone)\n          We're running late...\n\n                       LILLI\n                 (turns to Guido and lights\n                  a cigarette)\n          Calm down. Directing a movie is a very\n          overrated job, we all know it. You\n          just have to say yes or no. What else\n          do you do? Nothing. Maestro - Should\n          this be Red? Yes. Green? No. More\n          extras? Yes. More lipstick? No. Yes,\n          no, yes, no, yes, no - that's\n          directing.\n\nLilli hands Guido the lit cigarette.\n\n                       GUIDO\n          That's right: that's directing. And it\n          doesn't seem to make a blind bit of\n          difference, finally, what the answer\n          is...\n\n                       LILLI\n          So please, Guido, yes or no, do you\n          want any costumes in this film?\n\n                       GUIDO\n          Yes.\n                                      p. 8\n\n\n\n                       LILLI\n          You see - simple!\n                 (handing him an espresso\n                  fetched by her assistant,\n                  ROBERTA)\n          Might I know what period the movie's\n          in?\n\nLilli glances at Dante who has edged closer to the\ntable, he looks at the costumes.\n\n                       GUIDO\n          Yes, yes.\n                 (downs the espresso)\n          Soon.\n\nLilli glares at Dante, ushering him away.\n\n                       LILLI\n          You know I don't allow producers in\n          here.\n\n                       DANTE\n          Alright. Two minutes Guido.\n\nLilli is the only person who intimidates Dante. He\nleaves. Guido pulls out his own tie from his pocket.\n\n\nLilli walks round and takes the tie off him. Guido sits\nup. Lilli puts the tie round his neck.\n\n                       LILLI\n          He's gone.

An Italian pop song of    the day is playing on the\nradio as he speeds around the   Piazza del Poppolo. In\nfront of him in the convoy is   Dante with Fausto.\n\n\nINT. GUIDO'S CAR - DAY\n\nAs Guido drives, he turns to see his MAMMA in the\npassenger seat. He's not remotely surprised. She\nappears the way he remembers her.

My heart is\n          racing. Am I dying, Mamma? I owe you\n          flowers, I know. I'll come to the\n          cemetery at the weekend. You should\n          have let me bury you in Roma, Mamma, I\n          could visit you every week.

STREETS OF ROME / INT. GUIDO'S CAR - DAY\n\nThis is the Rome of La Dolce Vita, the Rome of Vespas,\nskinny ties, cool sunglasses, impossibly cool young\npeople.

All the reporters fire their\nquestions at once. The questions come on top of each\nother, and Guido covers his despair with an inflated\nenergy. He takes his sunglasses off and signals to\nDINARDO, a harsh-looking woman.\n\n                       DINARDO\n          Maestro Contini.

They cost too\n          much, they take too long, and they\n          involve too many people. So they\n          should have grand titles.\n\n                       DINARDO\n          And might you tell the press what the\n          film is about?\n\n                       GUIDO\n          Why? I still don't know what my last\n          film was about.\n\n                       LEOPARDI\n                 (In a loud aside to\n                  Dinardo)\n          That was the problem.

I... won't.\n          I'm afraid that if I say anything, the\n          word might get out to the Press.\n\nGeneral laughter in the room. He wins a round, but is\nclearly feeling the strain... Dante recognizes, steps\nin.\n\n                       DANTE\n          Our next film will be exactly as it\n          sounds. Italia. It's the very spirit\n          of Italy - Italy as myth, Italy as a\n          woman, Italy as a dream.\n\n                       LEOPARDI\n          Is this true?\n\n                       GUIDO\n          It sounds fantastic.

Approaches her, and undoes the\nchignon, freeing her hair. She's beautiful and\ninnocent. Guido says something to her, a whisper.

He\nstops the engine, and sits for a moment in silence.\nSummoning his courage, he gets out of the car. He is\ngreeted by Pierpaolo. He seems to need and acknowledge\nhis support.

STAGE 5, FILM SET, CINECITTA - DAY\n\nGuido is in his element again, locked in passionate\ndiscussion with an ACTOR and an ACTRESS. In his hand,\nan actual script. The set surrounding them is modest;\na tiny bedroom with a single window and rumpled sheets.\nThe vast film Italia has clearly given way to something\nsmaller, and perhaps truer: the tale of a man and a\nwoman.\n\n                       GUIDO\n          I don't want to say too much. The\n          first way that we kill our film is by\n          talking about it. But this scene is\n          about reconciliation. And within the\n          scene I would like you to try and find\n          your way to begin that journey back\n          towards each other.\n\n\nINT.

They enter with a\nsense of anticipation and excitement and arrange\nthemselves on the staircases and scaffolding that loom\nbehind Guido. They are all dressed in angelic white.\n\nBut Guido is oblivious, focused instead on the task\nthat lies ahead. He talks to his cameraman. Puts down\nhis script. He takes off his jacket and hangs his\nglasses off his sweater, stands contemplating the set\nin front of him.\n\n                       PIERPAOLO\n          Maestro, should I call final checks?\n\n                       GUIDO\n          Yes.\n\n                       PIERPAOLO\n          Makeup, please!

A\npart of him now and forever.\n\nGuido sits on the crane.\n\nThe soundstage door opens, and we see a small figure\nslip quietly onto the set. Tentatively, she steps\nthrough the shadows. It's Luisa. From a discreet\ndistance, she watches her husband return to his gift.\n\nPierpaolo calls for silence.\n\n                       PIERPAOLO (CONT'D)\n          Alora. Silencio per favore.

SENATE HEARING ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY\n\nBlinding in their white uniforms, naval flag officers sit\nin the audience, showing their support for THEODORE HAYES,\na 50-year-old civilian.  This is his confirmation hearing.\nReading from prepared material:\n\n                         HAYES\n          ... last few years have brought many\n          advances in the interests of women\n          in naval service, particularly in\n          the land-based maritime specialties.\n          What's more, the Navy has instituted\n          special sensitivity courses with an\n          eye on --\n\n                         DEHAVEN\n          Whoa, whoa, whoa.  \"Land-based\n          maritime specialties.\" Gimme a\n          second here to de-euphemize that...\n\nAt the center of a dais, LILLIAN DEHAVEN leans back to\nponder the ceiling of the hearing room.  Her plaque card\nreads \"CHAIRPERSON -- SENATE ARMS COMMITTEE.\" DeHaven is a\ntough-hided old Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara at 60.\nIn her arsenal she carries conversational hand-grenades --\nand she's apt to pull a pin at the slightest whim.\n\n                         DEHAVEN\n          Would that be anything like\n          \"typing\"?  \"Restocking the\n          cupboards\"?  That sort of thing, Mr.\n          Hayes?\n\nCHUCKLES from the packed gallery.  The flag officers go\nstone-faced.  Hayes forces a smile.\n\n                         HAYES\n          Hardly the case, Senator.\n\n                         DEHAVEN\n          Well, I'm just an old dame without\n          much time left, so you'll pardon me\n          if I jump right in here before they\n          discontinue my blood-type.  I am\n          deeply concerned over the Navy's\n          seemingly incontrovertible attitude\n          toward women in the military.  Case\n          in point...\n\nOn cue, aides begin distributing reports to other members\nof the dais.  Hayes gets a copy, too.  And it jars him.\n\n                         DEHAVEN\n          \"The Lark Report.\"\n\n                         HAYES\n          Madam Senator... this is an internal\n          document of the U.S. Navy.

She's roasting his nuts over an open\nfire, and everyone knows it.\n\n                         HAYES\n          The commission concluded that the\n          aviator in question failed to\n          execute a proper approach to the\n          carrier.\n\n                         DEHAVEN\n          That aside for the moment, I'm\n          struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit\n          of your report... the degrading\n          remarks by other aviators...\n          innuendo about her performance in\n          unrelated situations... even a\n          reference to her sexual activity the\n          weekend prior.\n                  (closing report)\n          In my seven years on this committee,\n          I've never seen a downed aviator\n          treated like this.  Never.  I'm\n          deeply disturbed by this report, Mr.\n          Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for\n          women in the military -- but for\n          your own confirmation as well.\n\n\nINT.

But if it's on my desk,\n          it's on my shoulders.  There's going\n          to be an inquiry -- it will not be\n          quick and it will definitely not be\n          pretty.

At\n          least that was the intent.\n\n                         JORDAN\n          What changed?\n\n                         DEHAVEN\n          Should probably ask him that.\n\n                         JORDAN\n          If I have to ask again, Senator,\n          I'll be asking in front of cameras.\n\nIt's a threat DeHaven doesn't appreciate.  The Senate\nDOORKEEPER appears.\n\n                         DOORKEEPER\n          Madam Senator?  Your esteemed\n          colleagues are requesting --\n\n                         DEHAVEN\n          Two seconds, Walter.\n                  (answering Jordan)\n          In 1981, the Supreme Court was\n          asked to rule on the issue of women\n          in combat positions.  The Court\n          cited the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws\n          as a legal foundation for keeping\n          women ineligible.  That decision\n          held for all these years -- until\n          the White House, 10 days ago, moved\n          to have the Exclusion Laws voided.\n          To demolish that legal foundation.\n\n                         JORDAN\n          So?  Isn't the President jumping on\n          your bandwagon?\n\n                         DEHAVEN\n          What he did was light the bandwagon\n          on fire.  Because he knows what I\n          know -- that American families are\n          not prepared to put their daughters\n          in harm's way.\n\n                         JORDAN\n          You don't know that.\n\n                         DEHAVEN\n          In face, I do:  Roper, Harris,\n          Gallop -- they all come back the\n          same.\n\n                         JORDAN\n          What are you saying?  That a women's\n          life is more valuable than a man's?\n          That a women's death hurts a family\n          more?\n\n                         DEHAVEN\n          I'm saying it's not going to happen.\n          Not when the President is set to\n          turn this into a third-rail issue\n          should I choose to ever campaign\n          against him.  He will fry me six\n          ways to Sunday for sending daughters\n          and young mothers off to war -- and,\n          quite possibly, for bringing them\n          back in body bags.\n\nJordan shakes her head in disbelief.

Not exactly debonair, am I?\n              (Harry TRIPS, his wife\n               looks disgusted)\n          Awww, man, it's down right sad. Look at\n          me. I look like I'm about to die.

Harry's\nbehind the wheel, shades, smoking a cigar, livin' large. Next\nto him sits a thoroughbred of a girl. An \"IT\" Girl. Smart,\nsexy and built for fun. She has perfected flirting to an art.\nHer hand rests on Harry's neck. There's a good thirty year\nage difference between them. Her name is MARIN. She SINGS\nalong with Ja Rule, now coming from a CD.\n\n                    MARIN\n\n              ( singing)\n          To all my thugs that be livin' it\n          up, we say, what I do.

I mean, she's\n          great. She's totally brilliant, but\n          she's not your type.\n\n                    HARRY\n\n          You're overlooking one of the great\n          things about me.

Harry keeps looking at Marin.\n\n                    HARRY\n\n          -- For what?\nHarry waits. RINGGG!\nHe doesn't look away.\n\n                    MARIN\n\n          For never dating anyone over 30.\n          Don't look at me like that.\n\n                    HARRY\n\n          It's just not true.\n\n                    MARIN\n\n          Okay. Sorry. Over 31?\n\n                     HARRY\n\n          Oh, so you wait 'til we get out to The\n          Hamptons to let me know you're a wise\n          ass.\n               (answers phone)\n          Hold on. . .\n               (then to Marin)\n          It just so happens, my dear, that women\n          of a certain age, don't date me.

No, I have it.\nHarry hangs up, doesn't look in Marin's direction to see if'\nshe caught that. This brand of cool is about not playing that\ncard. Marin turns toward him, she has been listening. They've\nreached the end of the road, sand dunes, long lilting grass\nand the ocean stretch before them.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    MARIN\n\n              (all business)\n          Make a right, left at the second\n          fence.\nMarin turns up the CD, getting herself out of whatever just\ncame over her, looks out the window.\n\n                    HARRY\n\n          Have I mentioned how gorgeous your\n          breasts look in this sweater?\n\n                    MARIN\n\n              (blushing)\n          Yes you have actually.\n\n                     HARRY\n\n          So it would be too much to mention it\n          again. . .\nMarin laughs, softening, as Harry turns down a dirt driveway,\ndriving toward a DREAM BEACH HOUSE.\n\n                    HARRY\n\n          Wow. It's the perfect beach house.\n\n                    MARIN\n\n          I know. My mother doesn't know how\n          to do things that aren't perfect.\n\n                    HARRY\n\n          Which explains you.\nThat got her. Harry parks. She looks over at him but he's\ngrabbing some cigars for his shirt pocket, then looks up at\nher with an innocent look that suggests he did not just say\nsuch a lovely thought.\n\n                    MARIN\n\n              (trying to keep up with\n               him)\n          Yeah, okay, right...\nThey both grab their H\n                     overnight bags and step out of the car.\n\n                     ARRY\n\n          So, what are we gonna do out here,\n          just the two of us, for two whole\n          days?\nMarin sets her bag down, walks to Harry, wraps her arms\naround his neck.\n\n                    MARIN\n\n          Tell me the truth, are you at all\n          glad we waited?\n\n\n\n\n                                                            6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       HARRY\n\n             I'm incredibly glad we're finally\n             going to do it.\n                 (she's a bit disappointed)\n             If that's the same as being glad we\n             waited, then baby doll, I'm ecstatic.\nMarin smiles then kisses him.

No smoking in the house.

HOUSE\n\nIt's one of those great Beach Houses. Light filled and warm\nwith spectacular views of the sandy landscape wrapping around\nthe rear of the house. Marin, now in a tight tank, tight\npants, gives Harry the grand tour as she continues to\nundress.\n\n                       MARIN\n\n                 (TAKING OFF her belt)\n             The fabulous living room, perfect for\n             entertaining an intimate group of friends\n             or that special someone.\n                 (DROPS her belt then\n                  UNBUTTONS Harry's shirt)\n             Behind me, the requisite Hampton's deck\n             complete with pool and ocean view.\n\n\n\n\n                                                           7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    MARIN (CONT'D)\n\n              (UNBUCKLES Harry's belt)\n          Your pants, please...\n\n                    HARRY\n\n          Ladies first.\nMarin provocatively UNZIPS her pants and wriggles out of\nthem. She's now in a TINY TANK AND BIKINI PANTIES.\n\n                    MARIN\n\n          Gourmet kitchen's to your left\n          where tonight I will whip you up a\n          culinary feast of Mac and Cheese.\nMarin HEARS Harry's ZIPPER UNZIP. She turns, her EYES\nWIDENING as Harry's PANTS land on a chair. Harry is now down\nto his Boxers, an Open Shirt and a fearless smile.\n\n                    MARIN\n\n              (smiling)\n          ..

Do we like it? Going\n          once, going twice ...\n\n                    HARRY\n\n          Sold.\nHarry takes Marin's hand and pulls her OUT OF FRAME and ONTO\nTHE BED. She playfully rolls on top of him. His hands cup her\nass.\n\n                    MARIN\n\n          You know when I first started\n          auctioneering someone told me if I was\n          nervous to just picture everyone in the\n          audience in their underwear. This sort of\n          gives that a whole new meaning.\n\n                    HARRY\n\n          Why? You're not nervous now, are you?\n\n                    MARIN\n\n          I'm always a little nervous.\n\n                    HARRY\n\n              (removing his hands)\n          So put on your bathing suit.

Catches his breath. He\nsits up, feet on the floor, shoulders hunched, clears his\nthroat, bangs on his chest. He waits a sec then stands with a\nstiffness that for the first time suggests he is not a that\nyoung man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM\n\nNow wearing only his Boxer Shorts, Harry crosses through the\nLiving ROOM, singing 'Livin' It Up' to himself. He reaches into\nhis bag and lifts out Two Bottles of Crystal. He sees himself in\nthe mirror, sucks in his gut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINT. KITCHEN\n\nWell stocked, the best of everything. Harry opens the door to the\nfridge and just as HE DISAPPEARS BEHIND IT, the BACK DOOR OPENS\nand TWO WOMEN ENTER from a beach walk, in the middle of a lively\nconversation.\nOne of them is ERICA, Marin's Mother. The other is Erica's\nYounger Sister, ZOE.\nERICA is in her mid-fifties and is a poster girl for growing old.\nIt's actually hard to imagine 55 looking any better. And not\nbecause she looks 35, but because she makes 55 look graceful and\nright. Erica is the \"girl most likely\" who went beyond\nexpectations but didn't realize until recently that being sure of\nherself was a handicap. She doesn't try to be intimidating, she\njust is.\nHer sister, ZOE is in her forties. Zoe's the loose one. She\nwears draw string pants and a T-shirt that says, \"BOYS LIE\".\nThe Women stop mid-sentence when they notice the REFRIGERATOR\nIS WIDE OPEN. Then they SEE A PAIR OF BARE MEN'S LEGS poking\n\n                     E\n\nout from UNDER THE DOOR. They don' t move.\n\n                     RICA\n\n          Oh God. What is this?\nErica nods to Zoe, gesturing a nearby knife. Zoe grabs the knife.\nHarry pokes his head out from behind the fridge, equally confused.\n\n                    ERICA\n\n              (in control)\n          Okay, stay right where you are. We have a\n          knife.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    HARRY\n\n              (eyeing the knife)\n          Do you... live here?\n\n                    ERICA\n\n          Okay, Mister, look, I'm gonna dial\n          911 and you're not gonna move. Zoe,\n          hand me the phone.\n              (reaches out to Zoe\n               without looking at her)\n\n                    HARRY\n\n          You don't understand. I'm a friend\n          of your daughter's.\nWith that, Harry SHUTS the fridge door. The Women see he's\nnaked except for a Pair of Boxers. They both GASP. Zoe\nFUMBLES the phone over to Erica who dials quickly..\n\n                    ERICA\n\n          Yeah? I don't think so. My daughter's in\n          the city and you what, wandered in\n          here,like high on Ecstasy..?.\n              (looks at phone)\n          Shit. I dialed 8-1-1.\n              (redials)\n\n                    HARRY\n\n              (calmly starts to move)\n          Honestly, if you just...\n\n                    ERICA\n\n          Back off. She was in the Israeli\n          army. She can break you in half.\nZoe can't believe she just said that -- no truth in it\nwhatsoever.\n\n                    ERICA\n\n              (into phone)\n          Yes.

It's a landscape in miniature. We HEAR the forest. Some \n\tdistant birds. Their sound seems to reverberate as if in a cavern. A piece of \n\tsunlight refracts within the drops of water, paints a patch of moss yellow. The \n\twhisper of wind is joined by another sound that mixes with it. A distant \n\trustling. It gets closer and louder. It's shallow breathing. It gets ominous. \n\tWe're interlopers on the floor of the forest and something is coming. \n\n\tSUDDENLY: A MOCCASINED FOOT\n\t\n\trockets through the frame scaring us and ... \n\n\tEXTREMELY CLOSE: PART OF AN INDIAN FACE\n\trunning hard. His head shaved bald except for a scalp-lock. Tattoos. He's \n\ttwenty-five. He seems tall and muscled. Heavy, even breathing. We'll learn later \n\tthis man is UNCAS, the last of the Mohicans. \n\n\tPROFILE: UNCAS' ARMS\n\n\tflash as he runs. One carries a flintlock musket. Sweat on the man's skin. A \n\tcalico shirt is gathered at the waist with a wampum belt of small white beads \n\tover a breechcloth. He wears leggings to protect his legs. A long-handled \n\ttomahawk is stuffed in his belt. \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - MASSIVE WAR CLUB - DAY\n\n\tin the hand of another running man. He's heavier, older ... \n\t\n\tCHEST\n\n\tA green bear claw is tattooed there. Silver armband. A snake is tattooed over \n\this left eyebrow. Silver rings in his ear. He's forty to forty-five. His head is \n\tshaved into a scalp-lock. It says: \"Come and lift this from me. Take it, if you \n\tcan ...\" That prospect strikes us as extremely unlikely. This man is \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK.\n\n\tThe French call him \"Le Gros Serpent,\" the Great Snake, because \n\t\"he knows the winding ways of men's nature and he can strike a sudden, deathly \n\tblow.\" \n\n\tWIDE ANGLE: CHINGACHGOOK\n\n\truns, disturbing no leaves, no branches; making no sound. He's running parallel \n\tto Uncas through the cathedral of mature forest. It's heavily canopied. There's \n\tvery little brush. The girth of the trees is huge. Shafts of light illuminate \n\tmotes of dust and turn leaves emerald where the sun breaks through. Sometimes \n\tthere's ferns; rhododendron, sometimes pale grass and outcroppings of rock. \n\tThese men run the forest streams, over boulders, fallen trees and down into \n\travines as if they own them. They do. \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - LONG BLACK HAIR - DAY\n\n\trocketing through trees. His torn buckskin shirt is tied at the waist with a \n\twampum belt holding a tomahawk and a large knife. A long rifle in which is \n\tcarved the name \"Killdeer\" is in his right fist. Indian tattooing on his chest. \n\tHis name is NATHANIEL POE. He's a few years older than Uncas. The French and \tthe French-speaking tribes know him as La Longue Carabine (Long Rifle). Other \n\tfrontiersmen in New York colony and the Iroquois and Delaware-speaking tribes \n\tknow him as Hawkeye. Sweat stains his shirt. He flashes through the tree \n\tbranches disturbing nothing. Making no sound. \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S POV: A PIECE OF TAN\n\n\ttwo hundred and fifty yards away, a few square inches buried in the foliage ... \n\n\tSUDDENLY HE STOPS\n\n\tKilldeer's at his shoulder ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S THUMB\n\n\tcocks the lock holding the piece of flint: click. \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tstops dead, holding out his hand ... no sound. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tslips through young trees and stops, shouldering his smoothbore musket. Is this \n\tan ambush? \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S POV: RACK FOCUS THROUGH THE GUN SIGHT\n\n\tFive feet and fourteen pounds of rifle is elevated a half inch and shifted left, \n\toff target.

His massive war club is flat and \n\tangles to one side with a stabbing blade. Hawkeye is stepson and stepbrother. \n\tThe two younger men treat Chingachgook with an easy deference and affection. \n\tHawkeye's a dialectic of two cultures. In his coloration and worldliness he's \n\tmore the Anglo-Saxon frontiersman. In his independent views and candid manner \n\tand in his combat skills and woodsmanship, he's more native American (Mohican). \n\tAs Chingachgook takes out his long knife and they approach the fallen elk ...] \n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCHINGACHGOOK \n\t\t\t\t(low Mohican; sub-titled)\n\t\t\tWe're sorry to kill you, Brother. \n\t\t\tForgive us.

In the background are\n\tsixty men, women and children. It's a community gathering held out of doors. \n\tWe've entered mid-scene. Captain Jack is standing on a box. Some women and kids\n\tmill around some tables and boards laid over barrels. Cooking fires. Smoke. \n\tMost but not all around Captain Jack are men, nine settlers, 3 hunter/trappers, \n\teight Mohawk farmers in mixed European and native clothing. Off to the side are \n\tan English Lieutenant on horseback and a ten-man escort from whatever regiment's in\n\tAlbany. A man named HENRI speaks in French.

Trade furs with Les Francais. Now Les \n\t\t\tFrancais bring Huron onto Mohawk hunting grounds ... \n\n\tThese people are English, Scots-Irish and Dutch farmers; some French Huguenot\n\t\"mechanics\" (craftsmen). They're in shirt-sleeves and Indian moccasins & leggings. The\n\tMohawks' vast lands and corn agriculture border the settlement. They 've been\n\tacculturated for over a hundred years. Some wear European calico hunting shirts.\n\tTheir heads are shaved to scalping locks and many are tattooed. They've politically and\n\tcommercially played France & England against each other very adroitly for over a\n\thundred years because of their military power and geographic position. Their relations\n\twith working farmers and settlers and their families has been mostly one of \n\tco-existence because there's always been more than enough for all. This is a WPA\n\t mural of ethnic diversity and plurality of frontier America. The Europeans are former\n\tindentured laborers, farmers exiled by economics or religious persecution, frontier\n\thunters and trappers ... working people.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tONGEWASGONE\n\t\t\t\t(continues) \n\t\t\tNow Mohawk will fight Huron and Les Francais. \n\t\t\tMy brothers have asked me to lead them in this \n\t\t\twar so I speak for the Twin River Council. \n\n\tThe importance of this commitment is apparent to the lieutenant. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLIEUTENANT\n\t\t\tHis Majesty King George II is very grateful for \n\t\t\tyour support. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tIAN\n\t\t\tHow far up the valley? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLIEUTENANT\n\t\t\tTo Fort William Henry. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLONIAL #1\n\t\t\t... two days from here. \n\n\tSome don't like this.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLIEUTENANT\n\t\t\tIt should be enough to remind you France is \n\t\t\tthe enemy. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tYour enemy ... \n\n\tHeads turn to Hawkeye at the periphery of the crowd.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLIEUTENANT\n\t\t\tWhat did you say? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(loud)\n\t\t\tI said ...

Help my man outside with the baggage. \n\n\tGENERAL JEROME WEBB sees Heyward and nods. Three of Webb's Adjutants are\n\ton either side. Three remaining Grenadiers in bearskin-covered mitred caps are at the\n\tdoor. Facing Webb are a half dozen colonial representatives, including Captain Jack\n\tWinthrop. Heyward watches Jack ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLIEUTENANT\n\t\t\tThey will report or be pressed into service! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLARGE COLONIAL REP\n\t\t\tAny of the boys worth havin' can disappear into \n\t\t\tforest ... time it takes you to blink.

Arrested ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tWEBB\n\t\t\t\t(cuts in)\n\t\t\tI cannot imagine his Majesty, in his benevolence, \n\t\t\twould ever object to his American subjects \n\t\t\tdefending their hearth & home, their women & children, \n\t\t\tif threatened by the \"scourge\" of attack from savages, \n\t\t\taroused to such excess by our enemy, the \n\t\t\tever-perfidious French. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\t\tDoes that mean they will be granted leave to \n\t\t\tdefend their homes if the settlements are \n\t\t\tattacked? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tWEBB\n\t\t\tOf course. \n\n\tHeyward's more amazed by what he's just heard from Webb. These Americans,\n\tincluding Jack, are streaming past him on their way out.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\t\tYou got yourself a colonial militia, General. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tMajor Duncan Heyward reporting, Sir! \n\n\tWebb's pouring gin.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWEBB\n\t\t\tDuncan. How was your journey? \n\n\tThe door closes. Dispatches are passed. They are now alone except for the General's\n\ttwo Adjutants and a shadowy form waiting patiently in a corner. He's MAGUA. In the\n\tdim light, he's motionless. Webb slides a glass across to Heyward.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tI didn't experience anything so surprising from \n\t\t\tBristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tWEBB\n\t\t\tAnd what is that? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tThe Crown \"negotiating\" the terms of service? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tWEBB\n\t\t\tI know.\n\t\t\t\t(assuming a co-commiserator)\n\t\t\tOne has to give Americans \"reasons\" and make \n\t\t\tagreements to get them to do anything at all. \n\t\t\tTiring, isn't it? \n\t\t\t\t(throws up his hands)\n\t\t\tBut that's the way of it here. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(tight)\n\t\t\tI thought British policy is 'Make the \n\t\t\tWorld ...

I was to \n\t\t\trendezvous with them in Albany and escort them \n\t\t\tto the fort. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tWEBB\n\t\t\tYes. You may.\n\t\t\t\t(to Magua, after a glance at Heyward)\n\t\t\tYou there. What does Munro call you?\n\t\t\t\t(to Heyward) \n\t\t\tThe \"Scotsman\" has sent one of his Indian allies \n\t\t\tto guide you. \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\trises and slowly walks into the light. He is reserved and over six feet tall. His head is\n\tshaved into a mohawk. Rings, beads & feathers pierce his ears. A blanket is worn as a\n\tshawl over his left shoulder exposing his right arm and heavy tattooing. A long\n\ttomahawk is in the belt of his breechcloth.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWEBB\n\t\t\tThe Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's \n\t\t\thouse. A company of the 33rd will accompany \n\t\t\tyou and Magua will show you the way. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tBy your leave, sir. \n\n\tWebb holds Heyward a moment\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWEBB\n\t\t\t\t(to Adjutants)\n\t\t\tExplain to the Major we care little about toying \n\t\t\twith colonial militia because we have little to \n\t\t\tfear from the French. They have not the nature \n\t\t\tfor war. Their Latinate voluptuousness combines with \n\t\t\ttheir Gallic laziness and the result is: they would\n\t\t\trather make love with their faces than fight. \n\n\tWebb's Adjutants laugh uproariously at his wit. Heyward's stiff, perfunctory smile. He's\n\tbeen made the butt of the joke. He does not share Webb's derisive view of the French.\n\tWebb doesn't like Heyward's manner. We don't like Webb. Then:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWEBB\n\t\t\t\t(continuing) \n\t\t\tDismissed. \n\n\tHeyward stiffly salutes. Webb casually, perfunctorily salutes the younger man in\n\treturn.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(to Magua)\n\t\t\tDawn. At the encampment. Six a.m. sharp. See \n\t\t\tto it you're there.\n\n\tBeneath Magua's barely deferential manner we sense intelligence & menace. None of \tthese Brits see it. We do. \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR POLTROON'S HOUSE - DUNCAN HEYWARD - DAY\n\n\tbrushed clean, his wig freshly powdered, his tricorn in his hand with a crimson sash and\n\tsword and his cavalry boots, walks through the gate after knocking. He enters a small\n\tcourtyard. Suddenly he hears ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(O.S.)\n\t\t\tHeyward! Duncan Heyward. \n\n\tHeyward looks to the side. An inner light turns on. In this mode, this is a man we could\n\tlike. \n\n\tREVERSE: CORA MUNRO\n\n\tenters from the garden. She's vivacious, dark-haired, unconventional in that she's\n\teducated, but with conventional values and attitudes. She hugs Duncan to her and \n\tthen pushes him away to look at him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tMy God it's good to see you. \n\n\tHe takes her hand in both of his and kisses it. He is open and lit up. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR POLTROON'S HOUSE, BACK YARD - CORA & HEYWARD - DAY\n\n\tA vegetable plot behind the Poltroon's house is a provincial substitute for a formal\n\tgarden setting. Heyward and Cora sit on rough wooden chairs. Wind blows. In the\n\tbackground a servant hangs laundry. The white sheets billow. A table holds a tea\n\tsetting. They're sitting close to each other, talking seriously and quietly. Duncan's\n\tjacket is removed. Time's passed. Long pause. Then:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tI'm embarrassed to be so indecisive ... after so \n\t\t\tlong apart and after you've traveled so far ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tAnd by sea! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tYou still have an aversion to the water? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tAversion? No. ... \"Hatred\" ... \"Loathing\" ... \n\n\tCora laughs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tBut it was worth it all to end in a garden by \n\t\t\tyour side.\n\n\tShe looks askance at him. Then the banter drops.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(difficult)\n\t\t\tDear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest \n\t\t\tfriend. Alice and I depend on you and respect \n\t\t\tyou immensely ... I wish they did, but my feelings \n\t\t\tdon't go beyond that. Do you see? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tIsn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis \n\t\t\tfor a man and woman to be joined?

In view of your \n\t\t\tindecision, why not rely on their advice and \n\t\t\tjudgment as well as mine? \n\n\tCora stares directly at Heyward. Then she looks away. She has no answer. Something\n\tsubterranean disturbs her about delegating judgment over the fate of her life.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tWill you consider that? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(pause; smiles)\n\t\t\tYes.

Rigid salutes. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tclimbs onto his white military charger. It's spirited. Cora & Alice are in riding dresses\n\t and veils. The veil doesn't completely cover Alice's golden hair and blue eyes and the\n\tflush of her complexion. They're riding two sidesaddled Narragansetts. The tight\n\t traveling dress reveals that Cora, two or three years older than Alice, is fuller and more\n\tmature. All three ride to the front of the column. The baggage horses and mule are in\n\tthe gap between the two companies. \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\tcradling his musket. \n\n\tREAR SHOT: THE COLUMN\n\n\tdown the path that leads into the wall of forest looks impressive. \n\n\tWIDER: THE COLUMN\n\n\tmarching. Now they look brave but smaller. The forest - with all its mysteries and\n\tdangers - now impresses us as a towering dark, sinister, and it's immensity swallows up\n\tthe living mass which slowly enters its bosom.\n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tINTERIOR FOREST\n\n\tTRACKING the Redcoats, their faces now filmed with dust, cut with lines of\n\tperspiration. They march in perfect formation. \n\n\tWe TRACK PAST the pack horses, the first company, Sgt. Major Ambrose and on to\n\tCora & Alice. Alice seems fatigued. Cora's turned, looking up into the forest canopy,\n\tastonished at the deep beauty of the place. \n\n\tCORA'S POV: FOREST CANOPY\n\n\tof trees is dark, except for spots where leaves are sparse, and there the light is golden.\n\tIt's the forest of childhood. \n\n\tIn a ravine a buck disappears into a deeper stand of trees.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(O.S.)\n\t\t\tAlice, did you see that ...? \n\n\tCORA'S\n\n\treverie's broken by Heyward entering the frame. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tAlice? \n\n\tAlice rouses from fatigue.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tAre you alright? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\t\tCan we rest soon? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tAbsolutely. \n\n\tHeyward rides to the front of the column to Magua, who's twenty to thirty yards ahead\n\tof everybody else.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tYou there, Scout! \n\n\tMagua slowly turns towards Heyward.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(overly articulated) \n\t\t\tWe must ... stop ... soon.

What did you say? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tMagua say: \"Yes. Good idea.\" \n\n\tAs they begin to stop ... \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR MOUNTAINS & FOREST - WIDE - DAY\n\n\tSilently entering on either side of us come Chingachgook, followed by Hawkeye and\n\tUncas. Even relaxed, they carry themselves with a degree of alertness. They're\n\teighteenth century Viet Cong moving through the rain forest. The Maxfield\n\tParrish/Hudson Valley of tall trees, ravines and streams is idyllic in front of them. All\n\tthree cradle their long guns and move silently on moccasined feet. \n\n\tFRONTAL: CHINGACHGOOK\n\n\t- in a stream - relaxed but attentive, abruptly stops. The others freeze in their tracks.\n\tChingachgook sees and then stoops to examine ... \n\n\tROCK\n\n\tunder the water in the stream. It's been turned from its bed. Chingachgook finds\n\tanother. Uncas, moving up on his flank, climbs the bank and moves off into the trees,\n\tsearches and then he gestures ... he's found another sign of something. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\thas headed off further down the stream and discovers nothing. Rapidly he rejoins Uncas\n\tand Hawkeye who've become extremely alert. They move up the bank into the forest\n\tninety degrees from their previous path. \n\n\tTRACKING: HAWKEYE, UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tmoving. Fast. Nearly soundless. They hardly disturb a blade of grass. The impression:\n\texpertise, deadliness and an impression something's wrong. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR FOREST, TRAIL - MAGUA - DAY \n\n\ton point. The trail cuts the side of a hill. The ground on one side rises into a forest\n\tacclivity and on the other falls off into a forested ravine. Magua walking towards\n\tcamera. \n\n\tCLOSER - MAGUA'S\n\n\tslid his tomahawk out from the front of his belt that girdles his waist. He lets the shaft\n\tdrop into his hand. He shrugs off his blanket. There is a solidity to his dark, tall figure\n\twe didn't see before. Magua turns about face and advances on the column. \n\tTRACK WITH Magua.\n\tHeyward and the Munro girls pass the camera as does Sgt. Major Ambrose, marching\n\tin advance of the men. Magua is approaching the soldier on the left in the first row. \n\tWe see Magua has caught the Redcoat's eye.\n\n\tREDCOAT\n\n\tis curious, starts to smile. What does the Huron want to say to him? When Magua is\n\ttwo steps away he caves in the side of the infantryman's head at the temple with the\n\tspike end of his tomahawk and, backhanded, hacks the blade through the side of the\n\tneck of the center man in the first row. \n\n\tSIMULTANEOUSLY\n\n\tthirteen muskets EXPLODE from the wooded rise. \n\n\tFIVE REDCOATS\n\n\tare blown off the path, two others are wounded ... \n\n\tAMBROSE\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAMBROSE\n\t\t\tForm company!

All\n\tthirteen face the incline. \n\n\tFORESTED RISE - HURONS\n\n\tflash downhill through the trees. Partnered in two-man teams, one loads and prepares\n\tand fires while the other advances to the next cover. He, then, prepares and fires\n\tcovering his partner's advance. Leaping fallen trees and boulders, they're athletic, fast\n\tand rapidly closing.\n\tEven though the disciplined English regulars are a killing machine, we now see their\n\ttactics in the dense forest are grossly inferior to the Hurons' ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tAMBROSE\n\t\t\tPresent!! \n\n\tCORA\n\n\tcovers Alice with her body, holding the reins of their bolting horses. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tfrom horseback aims his horse pistol, FIRES ... \n\n\tAN ATTACKING HURON\n\n\tleaping at him past Alice & Cora drops. \n\n\tMULE\n\n\twith baggage crashes off, down the ravine.

But this Huron easily slips the\n\tthrust and slams Heyward with his rifle butt. \n\n\tBRITISH\n\n\tdead and dying. \n\n\tAMBROSE\n\n\tblood gushing from his chest wound, fires his pistol, dropping a Huron; slashes a\n\tsecond with his sword. Then he's chopped down. Hurons begin scalping the British\n\twhile four race towards Heyward and the two women. \n\n\tHEYWARD & CORA & ALICE\n\n\tready to die. Heyward has only his fusil as a bludgeon. He readies ... \n\n\tTHREE LOUD SHOTS\n\n\tBLOW three of the Hurons sideways, head over heels down the rise. \n\n\tREVERSE: THREE MEN\n\n\tbarely seen, running diagonally across the fall line of the ravine. In parts, we recognize\n\tNathaniel, recharging Killdeer on full run, and Uncas. \n\n\tHURON'S\n\n\tnot sure where the shots came from. Suddenly Chingachgook slams him, head first into\n\tthe ravine with the war club. He didn't even slow down. \n\n\tHURON\n\n\twarrior spins. Uncas tomahawks his shoulder. The Huron swings downwards. Uncas\n\tducks beneath the swing and slashes his throat, sending him downhill into CAMERA \n\tas ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S\n\n\tmomentum and thrown tomahawk spread-eagles one Huron, near a couple of wounded\n\tRedcoats who fight on ... \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\tcalmly sees the odds have changed. His attention becomes focused. He commits a very\n\trevealing act seen through the blurred foreground action of struggling bodies. We will\n\tremember it. He raises his musket and aims at ... \n\n\tCORA MUNRO\n\n\twho's unaware she's a target. Why is he singling out a Munro girl to kill? \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tsees. Killdeer's at his shoulder ... \n\n\tTIME SLOWS: MAGUA\n\n\tsenses Hawkeye. Moving through liquid, his eyes drift left. The moment is frozen.\n \tTheir eyes lock, each to the other's. Then ... \n\n\tTIME UNFREEZES\n\n\tMagua swings at Hawkeye and FIRES ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tshifts. The .65 caliber musket ball rockets past his ear and he's already squeezing\n\tKilldeer's trigger as ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S POV OVER BARREL: SMOKE\n\n\tfrom Magua's musket blast clears. Magua's gone. He almost shape-shifted, it happened\n\tso quickly. It's nearly mystical. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tlowers Killdeer, impressed. \n\n\tCORA\n\n\tglances back at Hawkeye. She doesn't know why he's looking at her. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tpursues two fleeing Hurons up the incline. Two strides gain him the first man, who he\n\thamstrings and runs over to pursue the second up the hill ... as ... \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tin the confused melee, grabs a found musket and aims it at an Indian. We recognize that\n\the's aiming at Chingachgook pursuing the second Huron up the hill ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tNo, Duncan! \n\n\tDuncan ignores her. \n\n\tHEYWARD'S MUSKET\n\n\tis jerked from his hands.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t ... case your aim is any better'n your judgment. \n\n\tHe's drawn his sword, reflexively. Hawkeye flips the musket around one-handed. It's\n\tpointed at Heyward's chest. And Hawkeye FIRES, killing an attacking Huron behind\n\tHeyward. As Heyward spins ... \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK'S WAR CLUB\n\n\tflashes up the hill. It cleaves the second man's back and bowls him over. Chingachgook\n\tretrieves his club as his scalping knife slashes down ... \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tscalps the man he killed. Chingachgook dispatches the Huron he hamstrung. \n\n\tWIDE\n\n\tSudden silence. Heyward's motionless. The women are frozen, as terrified of the\n\tsavages and apparent half-breed rescuers as they were of those who attacked them. \n\n\tALICE\n\n\tCora, holding her, is stunned but functioning. Moments ago both women were clean\n\tand demure. Now their riding dresses are torn, mud-stained, blood-spattered and their\n\tbaggage is gone. \n\n\tHEYWARD'S\n\n\tcrossed to his slaughtered soldiers. Moments ago they were a testament to British\n\tmilitary power. Now they're dead meat. Ambrose's body is against a tree. In the B.G. \ttwo of the wounded start to rise ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\t\t\t(O.S.)\n\t\t\tStop it! \n\n\tHeyward spins. \n\n \tUNCAS\n\n\tjust cut the throat of the second Narraganset. It drops into the brush. Alice attacks\n\thim.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\t\tWe need them to get out of here! \n\n\tUncas gently restrains her. Cora reaches Alice and grabs her away from the \"savage\".\n\tHeyward runs in to protect the women ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(to Nathaniel)\n\t\t\t... why the bloody hell he do that to the horses?! \n\n\tUncas, all business, is now reloading, lifting powder horns, scanning the trees.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUNCAS\n\t\t\t\t(matter of fact) \n\t\t\t... too easy to track ... they can be heard for \n\t\t\tmiles ... find yourself a musket ... \n\n\tCora's surprised by Uncas' easy English. Hawkeye's scanning the forest.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(to Heyward)\n\t\t\tYour wounded should try walkin' back to Albany. \n\t\t\tThey'll never make a passage north. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(breathless)\n\t\t\tWe were headed ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(appropriating a knife)\n\t\t\t... Fort William Henry. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tto Hawkeye: let's go ... Then a fast exchange of Delaware. Cora's surprised to see it's\n\tChingachgook's decision. Chingachgook looks at the survivors, gives his assent, starts\n\toff.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t... take you as far as the fort. \n\n\tHawkeye throws Heyward a musket. Cora & Alice look towards Heyward. He looks at\n\tthem: the women are totally terrified and do not move.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tIf we are goin' to take you, we need to move. \n\t\t\tFast ... And the fort is well off our course. \n\t\t\tSo if you all rather wait for the next Huron \n\t\t\twar party to come by, we'll be on our way. \n\n\tHeyward quickly decides to go. The women follow. Hawkeye starts off after Uncas and\n\tChingachgook. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR FOREST - HAWKEYE - DAY\n\n\tmoves through the trackless forest. Uncas is far out on the left flank. Cora, Alice &\n\tDuncan Heyward follow in Hawkeye's and Chingachgook's steps ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S FEET\n\n\twalking through a creek, stepping in the stream bed instead of on stones. The others\n\tfollow. Hawkeye looks at Heyward. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tconforms. He's ill at ease not being in command, following the lead of some half-Indian\n\tfrontiersman through a foreign wilderness.] \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tHow far is it, scout? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tDay and a half \n\t\t\t\t(pause) \n\t\t\tWhere did you get ... the guide? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tColonel Munro sent him. He was one of our \n\t\t\tMohawk allies. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tHe is Huron and nothing else. \n\t\t\t\t(checking the Munro girls are \n\t\t\t\tnot too close)\n\t\t\tWhy would he want to murder the girl? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tWhat?! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tDark haired ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tMiss Cora Munro.

To Can-tuck-ee. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tI thought all our colonial scouts were in \n\t\t\tthe militia? \n\n\tOff to the side, Uncas smiles at the idea.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tI ain't your \"scout\". And I am in no damn \n\t\t\tmilitia. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(stops) \n\t\t\tThen you are one of those who would allow \n\t\t\tEngland to fight alone while she protects \n\t\t\tyou from France? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tEngland does not protect me and does not \n\t\t\twar against France on our account. She uses \n\t\t\tus to war against France on her own account ... \n\t\t\tof greed for land and furs. \n\n\tCORA'S\n\n\tappalled.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(turns) \n\t\t\tClear it up any? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(loud) \n\t\t\tI owe you gratitude or I'd call you out! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(low)\n\t\t\tDo not let gratitude get in the way ... \n\n\tCora's hand holds back Heyward's sword arm because suddenly Chingachgook looms\n\tover him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\t\t\t\t(to Hawkeye) \n\t\t\tYengeese no good in woods. Make more \n\t\t\tnoise, I kill him. \n\n\tHeyward spins. Hawkeye coolly watches Cora. Her attitude is hostile; aligned with\n\tHeyward. He turns away. Meanwhile ... \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tstops, alarmed. Something in the air bothers him. Hawkeye smells it, too. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tis already moving out front, low and fast ... \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR FOREST, TREE LINE - GREEN BRANCHES - DAY\n\n\tAfter we HOLD, we realize Chingachgook's been there all along. Hawkeye and Uncas\n\tjoin him where the branches meet the ground. Smoke drifts through the trees. \n\tHawkeye sees and dips his head, then looks again ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR CAMERON CABIN - WIDE - DAY\n\n\tBurned, smoldering, having fallen in on itself. TRACK LEFT past what was the\n\tdoorway. A dead child's hand protruding from the ruin. A fragment of a dress. Charred\n\tand smoldering wood. John Cameron's body in the wreckage. And then, through the\n\tcollapsed posts and timbers, Hawkeye, Chingachgook and Uncas have advanced and\n\tare seeing what we've just seen; and then Cora and Alice. \n\n\tALICE\n\n\tapproaches and is frozen in horror. Cora shields her from the sight. Cora is affected but\n\tconfronts it directly.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(O.S.) \n\t\t\tAnything to be done? \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\treturns from under one part of the wreckage, ashen, stoic, as they all are. We know the\n\tdegree of their inner pain.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUNCAS\n\t\t\tAll dead ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tbends over a moccasin print that Chingachgook's examining. They look at each other\n\tgrimly. Heyward joins them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tWho were these people? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(re: print) \n\t\t\tOttawa! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tExcuse me ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\t\t\t\t(to Hawkeye) \n\t\t\tOttawa. \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tenters, very careful where he places his feet ... Hawkeye gestures to Heyward to stay\n\twhere he is: on the periphery with the women.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUNCAS\n\t\t\tMirrors ... tools ... clothes ... all inside. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(to Chingachgook)\n\t\t\tMovin' fast, not able to carry much ... \n\t\t\tthis was a war party? \n\n\tChingachgook nods confirmation and indicates a direction in Mohican. The significance\n\tis very ominous to them. We don't know why yet. Chingachgook starts away ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tLet us look after them ... \n\n\tHe starts approaching the bodies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\t\t\tLeave them. \n\n\tHeyward stops. Hawkeye and Uncas follow Chingachgook, leaving the cabin.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(hasn't moved)\n\t\t\tThough they are strangers, they are at \n\t\t\tleast entitled to a Christian burial! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(shaking his head) \n\t\t\tLet us go, miss. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tI will not. I have seen the face of war \n\t\t\tbefore, Mr. Poe, but never war made on\n\t\t\twomen and children. And almost as \n\t\t\tcruel is your indifference. \n\n\tHawkeye turns back and rapidly approaches her. She takes a step back, fearful.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(contained)\n\t\t\tMiss Munro.\n\t\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\t\tThey are not strangers .... \n\t\t\tAnd they stay as they lay ...! \n\n\tCORA\n\n\trealizes Hawkeye knew these people and is deeply affected. She also realizes for the\n\tfirst time this is a whole new world with dynamics and complexities, behavior and\n\trhythms she doesn't understand. He turns away from her and walks on. She hesitates a\n\tmoment. \n\n\tWIDE ON THE SMALL CLEARING IN FRONT OF THE FARMHOUSE\n\n\tas Chingachgook and Hawkeye, extremely alert and cradling their cocked flintlocks,\n\twalk to camera, eyes sweeping the forest perimeter; they're followed by Cora, Heyward\n\thelping Alice and Uncas as rearguard.\n\n\tThe ruined cabin and the dead dream of a family smolders behind them. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR GLADE - PROFILE: HAWKEYE - NIGHT\n\n\tmoves through to where the trees seem sparse and are unnaturally white birch and\n\tsome thin grass grows. The land rises into a mound. Chingachgook and the others\n\tavoid stepping on the grass and cross to the other side of it. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tmutters something to Uncas. He nods and disappears amongst the white birch,\n\tsoundlessly. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tthrows Heyward a blanket. Heyward spreads the blanket below the top of the mound\n\tand - maintaining silence - he gestures for Cora & Alice to rest there. \n\n\tALICE'S HEAD\n\n\thits the blanket. She curls into a fetal position and she's out. Heyward is nearby on\n\twatch.\n\tHawkeye has taken a position two-thirds of the way around the crescent shaped\n\tmound.\n\tCora has sought him out. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tdoesn't react as Cora enters. He's scanning the trees; not looking at her. \n\tThey whisper ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tWhy didn't you bury those people? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tAnyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would \n\t\t\tsee it as a sign of our passing ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tYou knew them. \n\n\tHawkeye looks at her and nods.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(stiffly)\n\t\t\tYou were acting for our benefit. And I \n\t\t\tapologize. I misunderstood you. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tWell that is to be expected. My father ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tYour \"father\"? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tChingachgook. He warned me about \n\t\t\tpeople like you. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tHe did? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tYes. He said ... \"do not try to make them \n\t\t\tunderstand you.\" \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tWhat?! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tYes. And \"do not try to understand them. \n\t\t\tThat is because they are a breed apart and \n\t\t\tthey make no sense ...\" \n\n\tCora's indignation is cut off because ... \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tmoving fast. He gestures back the way he came and it means they're in jeopardy. Uncas\n\tdisappears around the mound. \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR BIRCH FOREST - TREES - NIGHT\n\n\tNothing. Imperceptibly we move closer and start to see shapes blocking out part of the\n\twhite birch. \n\n\tRED-PAINTED FACE\n\n\twhite eyes. A ruff of red hair stands straight up at the back of the large man's head. \n\tSlit and monstrously elongated earlobes are weighted with silver. He's followed by\n\tothers. Wary, silently, they hunt. \n\n\tDEEPER: MORE OTTAWA\n\n\tTowards the rear are two French Rangers (\"Coureurs des Bois\") from Le Regiment de\n\tla Sarre. They're bearded, dirty, dressed Indian-style in moccasins, leggings and\n\tbreechcloths with hooded hunting shirts. There's nothing clumsy about them. They're\n\tthe 18th century version of Special Forces who've gone indigenous. If they and the\n\tOttawa find our people, it's all over. \n\n\tALICE\n\n\tseeing the red-painted Ottawa approach, starts to panic. Her hyperventilating and\n\tinvoluntary small sounds of fear will reveal their position. A hand covers her mouth and\n\tsilences her struggling. WIDEN. It's Uncas. His other arm is around her, holding her,\n\tlooking towards the advancing Ottawa. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\ton his back, his tomahawk within reach on the ground. \n\n\tOTTAWA & FRENCH\n\n\tare fifty yards away from the crescent mound behind which lie our people. Mist\n\tenvelops them ... \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tHis massive arms spread revealing his war club in his left fist; his fusil in his right hand. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\twaiting for the attack. Cora's eyes are anxious, but there's no terror there. Nathaniel's\n\timpressed with her cool. He hands her a pistol. She takes it. He listens for the soft drop\n\tof moccasined feet ... \n\n\tOTTAWA\n\n\tthrough the grass. Thirty feet away they stop. They're motionless. Then their leader\n\tgestures and they start backing out. The French Rangers continue towards the crescent.\n\tThe Ottawa chief takes one's arm and stops him. The French Ranger whispers\n\tsomething inaudible. The Ottawa chief shakes his head, \"Non. Pas possible ...\" \n\tAnd means it. They retreat. \n\n\tSEPERATE SHOTS: HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, CORA\n\n\ttensely monitor the Ottawa retreat. \n\n\tUNCAS & ALICE\n\n\tHe slowly removes his hand from her mouth. She's a little shy, then she looks up,\n\tcatches his eyes. Then she averts her face. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tsees all of it; doesn't like it. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tThe Ottawa are gone.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(quietly)\n\t\t\tWhy did they turn back? \n\n\tIn answer Hawkeye looks behind & above her head.\n\n\tCORA\n\n\tturns and makes out stilt platforms of skeletons and torn strips of buckskin silhouetted\n\tagainst the night sky in the distance. They have camped on sanctified ground, a burial\n\tplace. \n\n\tCORA & HAWKEYE\n\n\tShe thinks it would be a mistake to ever underestimate the skill of these men or the\n\tdanger & complexity of this place. She hands the pistol back to him. Their hands almost\n\ttouch.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(still pissed off)\n\t\t\t\"We're a breed apart and we make no \n\t\t\tsense\" ...? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(smiles) \n\t\t\tIn your particular case, miss, I would \n\t\t\tmake some allowance ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(sarcastic)\n\t\t\tThank you so much. \n\n\tCora is angry. Hawkeye, staring at the trees, glances at her. She settles, looking at him.\n\tHer mood changes. Then ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tYou called Chingachgook your \"father\"?\n\t\t\tWhere is your real family? \n\n\tHawkeye's surprised by her question.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tThey buried my ma & pa and my sisters.\n\t\t\tAnd Chingachgook - who found me with \n\t\t\ttwo French trappers - raised me up as his \n\t\t\town. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tI'm sorry. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tI do not remember them. I was one or two. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tHow did you learn English? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tMy father sent Uncas & I to Reverend \n\t\t\tWheelock's school when I was ten. So\n\t\t\twe would know both worlds ... though \n\t\t\twe were told only bother learning readin' &\n\t\t\tarithmetic from yous. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tAnd what were the consequentialities of \n\t\t\tEuropean culture you didn't bother with? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tThe Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas \n\t\t\tabout the government of men. My father's \n\t\t\tpeople already know each man is his own \n\t\t\tnation. And only he can have dominion \n\t\t\tover himself. Not kings. No man is better \n\t\t\tthan any other man. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tIn London those radical ideas could land \n\t\t\tyou in Newgate prison. \n\t\t\t\t(changing the subject)\n\t\t\tWhy were those people living in this \n\t\t\tdefenseless place ...? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable\n\t\t\tto poor people. So after seven years \n\t\t\tindentured service in Virginia, they headed\n\t\t\tout here where they are beholden to none\n\t\t\tand not livin' by another's leave ... \n\t\t\tTheir name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.\n\n\tCora sees the slate grey clouds and, in between, the fields of stars. She looks at \tHawkeye; then again up at the night sky. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(continuing; looking up)\n\t\t\tMy father's people say ... at the birth of the \n\t\t\tsun and of his brother, the moon, their \n\t\t\tmother died ... so the sun gave to the earth \n\t\t\ther body, from which was to spring all life.\n\t\t\tAnd he drew forth from her breast the stars.\n\t\t\tThe stars he threw into the night sky to \n\t\t\tremind him of her soul. \n\t\t\t\t(the sky)\n\t\t\tSo there is the Camerons' monument ... \n\t\t\tmy folks', too, I guess. \n\n\tCORA'S\n\n\tpensive. Hawkeye's watching her. Her reaction is enigmatic. After a pause ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(low)\n\t\t\tYou are right, Mr. Poe. We do not \n\t\t\tunderstand what is happening here.\n\t\t\tAnd it is not as I imagined it would be, \n\t\t\tthinking of it in Boston and London ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tSorry to disappoint you ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\t\t(eyes downcast)\n\t\t\tOn the contrary. It is more deeply stirring ... \n\t\t\tto my blood ...\n\t\t\t\t(then up into his eyes)\n\t\t\t... than any imagining could possibly have \n\t\t\tbeen ... \n\n\tShe closes her eyes, turns slightly and prepares to sleep. Hawkeye is the one left staring\n\tinto the birch forest, a little surprised. Some of his assumptions about her were \n\twrong ... \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR FOREST - WIDE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n\tDeep fog has set in. A hand entering the frame scares the hell out of us. It moves a\n\tbranch aside. It's Uncas. Spread to the right is Chingachgook, far to the left is\n\tHawkeye. They hike up a steep forested slope in the heart of the Adirondacks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tMuch further? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tTop of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are \n\t\t\tdownhill of it. \n\n\tALICE\n\n\tRe-energized, her spirits pick up.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\t\tWill we be able to bathe? \n\n\tBefore Cora can answer they hear a deep, rolling roar. Alice is alarmed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tThunder ... Papa will arrange something. \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tlooks over his shoulder, sees something in the far distance, gestures to Hawkeye and\n\tChingachgook. \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S POV: DISTANT HILLS\n\n\tand the band of red-painted Ottawa and Coureurs des Bois, who have now split into\n\ttwo groups, are still on their trail. Meanwhile, oblivious ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tThe men of the regiment will fetch water from \n\t\t\tthe lake, build fires and provide every comfort \n\t\t\tyou desire, Alice ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\t\tDuncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora \n\t\t\tdoesn't marry you, I shall. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tAlice! \n\n\tHeyward laughs. Hawkeye sees them. It bothers us: will these Europeans, including\n\tCora, shed their frontier experience?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tALICE\n\t\t\tI can't wait to see Papa ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tAnd you, Duncan? What are you looking \n\t\t\tforward to? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tPosting to a different continent. \n\n\tHe and Alice laugh. Cora does not.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tI think it's very important and exciting. \n\n\tHeyward looks at her. She's not kidding. \n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE: HEYWARD\n\n\thelps Alice. As he does, he stares at Cora's seperation and now her proximity to\n\tHawkeye, who's walking on ahead, is something Heyward doesn't like. His dark\n\tthoughts are distracted by a FLASH of light and more ROLLING THUNDER. \n\n\tWIDE FROM THE FRONT - HAWKEYE\n\n\tdrops and pulls Cora to the ground.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tLightning? \n\n\tHawkeye doesn't answer as he, Chingachgook, Uncas and Heyward make their way to\n\tthe top of the ridge. \n\n\tCLOSER ANGLES: CORA & ALICE\n\n\tjoin them and look down upon their expectation of a secure piece of England in the\n\twilderness, a safe harbor, a father's warm welcome. \n\n\tTHEIR POV: FORT WILLIAM HENRY\n\n\tis none of those things. The thunder is the roar of French siege cannon clouded in dense\n\tsmoke. The flashes of light are mortar bombs exploding and illumination rockets' red\n\tglare. Fort William Henry is under a massive siege by a French and Huron army. \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tlooks over his shoulder. \n\n\tHIS POV: OTTAWA\n\n\tpursuing them. There's no way back. They're propelled forward. \n\n\tDISSOLVE TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR BATTLEFIELD, FRENCH BATTERY #1 - CLOSE SHOTS - DUSK\n\n\tFrench cannons roar black smoke and gouts of red flame. \n\n\tTRENCH\n\n\tdug by sappeurs behind the cover of a huge gambio pushed toward the fort by two\n\tpoles and fascis on the sides. \n\n\tENGLISH GUN CREW\n\n\tsearching the night. \n\n\tPOV: BATTLEFIELD\n\n\tis black. \n\n\tENGLISH ROCKETS\n\n\tlight the battlefield revealing the French trenches. \n\n\tENGLISH GUN CREW\n\n\texcited. Colonial militia and Mohawk snipers fire their rifles. The British gun crew\n\tscrambles to adjust their 18 pounders. \n\n\tFRENCH BATTERY #1 \n\n\tFIRES. \n\n\tFRENCH BATTERY #2\n\n\tFIRES. \n\n\tEXTERIOR FORT, WEST BATTERY\n\n\tTRACKING. French cannon FIRE rips into the fortifications, exploding wood and\n\tearth, shredding the English gun crew with cannister. The English fight stubbornly, but\n\twe feel they're outgunned. Meanwhile ... \n\n\tWIDE ANGLE FROM THE WATER\n\n\tA new artillery duel erupts. The action is to the west side of the fort. On the north, the\n\tfire fight is reflected on the black water of Lake George in our foreground. Then a dark\n\tshape wiping to the right cuts off those reflections. We see in silhouette the outline of a\n\tbirch canoe moving silently, barely rippling the mirrored surface of the lake. \n\n\tEXTERIOR LAKE GEORGE BANK - DEBRIS\n\n\tBehind it, two Canadiens and a Huron alternately snipe at the ramparts. \n\n\tLOW & WIDE: SNIPERS\n\n\tBehind them is black water. Its surface is broken by the rising mass of Chingachgook,\n\tfollowed by Uncas and Hawkeye. Muzzle flashes from the cannon reveal the canoe and\n\tthe forms of the girls further out. Chingachgook's war club is held low. The Huron\n\tsenses and turns and Hawkeye's thrown tomahawk knocks him back. Hawkeye's knife\n\tflashes in the night. Chingachgook drives the war club up, smashing a Canadien onto\n\tthe debris. The second Canadien jabs bayonet at Uncas, slashing his side. Uncas jerks\n\thim forward by the musket, folds him over and tomahawks him. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY, NORTH WALL - SALLY-PORT TUNNEL\n\t- NIGHT\n\n\tAmidst the cannonade roar, ad-libbed shouts from Hawkeye and Heyward convince\n\tbattle begrimed soldiers to open the sally-port. Our people rush in. \n\n\tTORCH LIGHT\n\n\tthe group moves through the long, dank, tunnel. Enlisted men escorting them. Another\n\ttorch from the other direction: CAPTAIN BEAMS is revealed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tI'm Major Duncan Heyward! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tBEAMS\n\t\t\tCaptain Jeffrey Beams.

Just then a mortar is fired and explodes, killing the gun crew. On the\n\tramparts Mohawks and Colonial Militia, sniping at the French.

Webb has no idea. And he certainly does \n\t\t\tnot know to send reinforcements! \n\n\tMunro has nowhere for his rage to go. Meanwhile, Alice clings to her father. At 45-55,\n\tthe British Army has been his life. He blindly believes in its institutions, though officers\n\tlike Webb would disdain his Scots origins. \n\tFrom under his fury: \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\t\t(flat)\n\t\t\tWhat happened to you? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(suddenly tired) \n\t\t\tAmbush ... on the George Road.

Munro holds her\n\ttighter. Then he whispers something to her. She nods her head. And Cora takes her.\n\tThey exit. \n\n\tMUNRO\n\n\tis moved beyond words by his daughters' presence. There's a break, a pause ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\t\t(to Heyward over table map)\n\t\t\tWhat a place for them ... \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tMight I enquire after the situation, sir, given \n\t\t\tthat I've seen of the French engineering from \n\t\t\tthe ridge above? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\t\t(perfunctory)\n\t\t\t Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine \n\t\t\tand he has more of them. They keep our heads \n\t\t\tdown while his sappers make thirty yards of \n\t\t\ttrench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a \n\t\t\ttwo hundred yard range, so when they're close \n\t\t\tenough, they'll move them in, lob explosive \n\t\t\trounds over our walls and pound us to dust. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tThey look to be three hundred yards out. \n\t\t\tYou have three days. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tBloody murderers. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tA man, here, can make a run straight through \n\t\t\tto Webb. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\t... not enough time to get to Albany and back \n\t\t\twith reinforcements ... \n\n\tA Sergeant enters, snaps to attention, says something to Beams, exits.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tWebb's not in Albany.

It means they're on the \n\t\t\tattack up and down the frontier. \n\n\tMunro turns to look at him for a long beat. Munro doesn't like what his response must\n\tbe to this news. He turns to Heyward and the map.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\t\t(cold)\n\t\t\tThank you. \n\n\tHawkeye's dismissed, frozen out.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tMany men here, their homes are in the path. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tThat's all, sir. \n\n\tHawkeye is furious. Chingachgook gestures Hawkeye out. He leaves Munro's quarters\n\talmost knocking over an entering Adjutant who backs way up to let Chingachgook\n\tpass.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tThings were done. Nobody was spared ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tTerrible feature of war in the Americas. \n\t\t\t\t(beat; a mantra)\n\t\t\tBest to keep your sight fixed on our duty. \n\t\t\tOur duty is to defeat France. That hangs \n\t\t\ton a courier to Webb. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tINTERIOR MONTCALM'S MARQUEE - CHORAL GROUP - NIGHT\n\n\tof three Seneca women and five boys, led by a Jesuit, sing the Te Deum in the Iroquois\n\tlanguage. This is a large tent that could sleep twenty. Montcalm's four personal guards\n\tare at the entrance as well as COMTE DE LEVIS in dirty lace, a facial wound and a\n\tbraceful of pistols on a sash. Inside is simple campaign furniture and a six by eight foot\n\tbattle standard and flag of France. \n\n\tMONTCALM\n\n\tstands with a huge and fearsome elaborately tattooed and robed Seneca chief in a silk\n\tturban ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSENECA CHIEF\n\t\t\t\t(low)\n\t\t\t... and the Black Robes of Michilimackinac left \n\t\t\tus no time to put our cabins in order before telling \n\t\t\tus our French father had need of our aid. We rolled \n\t\t\tour blankets and were the first to be here. Yet we \n\t\t\tare not the first and closest to my father's campfire. \n\n\tThe Marquis de Montcalm is forty-five, wears a large wampum belt as a sash over his\n\twaistcoat. He has an acute intellect, an elegant manner. He is more aristocratic than\n\tMunro, but a consummate professional soldier. Over the Seneca's shoulder, Montcalm\n\tsees and nods to ... \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\tentering with four Huron braves. This is not the Magua we saw on the trail. In his scalp\n\tlock, now red-stained and cut to a Huron roach, are three blacl plumes. A match-coat\n\tblanket drapes his left shoulder. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\t\t(to Seneca Chief)\n\t\t\tFor my children and the children of the true \n\t\t\tfaith, my friendship and esteem is boundless ... \n\t\t\tI will give you three oxen for a feast and tomorrow \n\t\t\tI, myself, will sing the war song with you in the \n\t\t\tgreat council house. \n\n\tThe Seneca Chief is satisfied and his people, plus the Jesuit, exit. The look on Magua's\n\tface and the wry expression on Montcalm's allows us to understand their relationship is\n\tbased on realpolitik.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tLe Renard Subtil, how are things with your \n\t\t\tEnglish friends? \n\n\tMagua exhales in derision as he brings a chair to face Montcalm and sits, European\n\tstyle ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\t\t(over his shoulder)\n\t\t\tLouis Antoine, join us. \n\n\tLOUIS ANTOINE DE BOUGAINVILLE enters. He wears a functional melange of\n\tIndian moccasins over white linen breeches and an officer's waistcoat. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tHear what le Subtil has to tell us ... \n\n\tBougainville published a book on integral calculus at twenty-five, at twenty-six was a\n\tsecretary to the French Ambassador in London, in January 1756 at twenty-seven he\n\twas elected a member of the British Royal Academy of Science and at age twenty-eight\n\the's aide de camp to the Marquis de Montcalm with the rank of captain. Later in life, he\n\tbrought \"bougainvillea\" from Tahiti to Europe to America.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tEnglish war chief, Webb goes to Fort Edward \n\t\t\twith 33rd Regiment. He does not know my \n\t\t\tfather's army attacks Fort William Henry. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tBOUGAINVILLE\n\t\t\tBut by now Munro knows his couriers didn't \n\t\t\tget through. He'll send another. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tThe Grey Hair will try. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tBOUGAINVILLE\n\t\t\tFour or five, including two women entered the \n\t\t\tfort ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tThe Grey Hair's children were under Magua's \n\t\t\tknife but escaped. They'll be under it again. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tWhy do hate the Grey Hair, Magua? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tWhen the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat \n\t\t\this heart. Before he dies Magua will put his \n\t\t\tchildren under the knife so the Grey Hair will \n\t\t\tsee his seed is wiped out forever. \n\n\tMontcalm won't get a direct answer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tMy sappeurs are advancing the trenches through \n\t\t\tthe night, now.

I would say she does ... \n\n\tHer apron is stained. Hawkeye sees this may be her first time in the New World, but it's\n\tnot her first military campaign. Still angered at Munro's dismissive response, he's\n\tnevertheless falling for Cora.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tShe does not shy away from much ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tPHELPS\n\t\t\t\t(elsewhere) \n\t\t\tWhat's that? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tNothin'. \n\n\tAlice Munro has caught Hawkeye's attention. Outside the surgery where a casement\n\tmeets a wall, she sits, withdrawn. A catatonic older woman in a fine dress sits next to\n\ther.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPHELPS (O.S.)\n\t\t\tMiss Cora?

Then he's up and he hurts. Cora starts to\n\ttend another wounded man. As they start out, Hawkeye hesitates. Sensing it, Cora\n\tturns.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tWhat are you looking at, Mr. Poe? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tWhy, I am looking at you, Miss. \n\n\tCora measures the directness of Hawkeye's manner.

We HEAR the ball cut air. A few leaves flutter ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR FOREST - CANADIEN\n\n\twhacked head over heels by the impact. \n\n\tCOURIER\n\n\tlooks over his shoulder. He didn't know the Canadien was there. He stumbles in the\n\thalf light. Then he runs on ... \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - WEST SALLY-PORT\n\n\tThe three companies of the 62nd Regiment of Foot file back into the fort in perfect\n\torder.

He's speechless. He's errect as he leaves the room. \n\n\tCLOSE: CORA\n\n\tThe tension rushes out of her and she shudders and leans against the quarter-timbered\n\twalls for support. Then she collects the linen and starts out. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tINTERIOR FORT, INNER CORRIDOR - CORA\n\n\tmoving through the corridor past wounded. Two French mortar bombs explode above\n\tone of the casements. We hear shrill screams in the distance and ...  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE (O.S.)\n\t\t\t... it was no raidin' party out for pillage.

More French rounds detonate O.S. What if Webb gets here and they\n\tneed to launch a counter-attack? They need every man they have. It's his moment of\n\tdecision ...  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(to Munro)\n\t\t\tI saw nothing that would lead me to the \n\t\t\tconclusion it was other than a raid by savages \n\t\t\tbent on thievery. \n\n\tJack Winthrop grabs Nathaniel.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tYou're a liar! \n\n\tCORA'S\n\n\tsaddened. Heyward's stature has fallen irrevocably in her eyes. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tcan't help it. He turns to look at Cora ... \n\n\tHEYWARD'S POV: DOORWAY\n\n\tShe's gone. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tsuffused with an inner sadness, turns to Hawkeye.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tAnd the blood is on your hands! \n\n\tHeyward reaches for his sword. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\t\t(to Heyward) \n\t\t\tI'll have none of that! \n\t\t\t\t(to colonials) \n\t\t\tMontcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. \n\t\t\tNot a butcher. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tEasy for you to suppose.

Get out. \n\n\tHawkeye and the others are not intimidated. Their rage smolders. The look on\n\tHawkeye's face says this is not over. \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR FORT, PARADE GROUND - BONFIRE - NIGHT\n\n\tSparks shower skyward. Impromptu music. Some Celtic proto-bluegrass played on\n\tfiddle & drums. It's stirring. \n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE: SOME WOMEN\n\n\tlaundresses, dance from soldier to soldier - English foot and American Rangers. A few\n\tpeople lit by the firelight are solemn. Most are stirred to lift their morale for a while. \n\n\tTHEIR FACES\n\n\tunderlit by the red firelight. They are a disposable people, a diverse plurality stuck in a\n\tpostage stamp-size fort in an ocean of forest, locked into mortal deadly conflict\n\t because of the policies of cold and distant European monarchs. \n\n\tA PLACE A LITTLE DISTANT FROM THE FIRE\n\n\tWe can barely make out the eyes and faces of a number of men behind logs, crates and\n\tnew wreckage from the day's bombardment. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(low)\n\t\t\t... got no kin in the settlements.

So each \n\t\t\tman make your own decision ... Those who \n\t\t\tare goin', be back here in an hour. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tOut the northern sally-port. Strike for the east \n\t\t\tside of the swamp until you clear the French \n\t\t\tpicket line. Head north over the ridge, then \n\t\t\tcome about southeast and fork left in Little \n\t\t\tMeadow and you're free of the outpost and \n\t\t\tskirmishers ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tA COLONIAL\n\t\t\t\t(grumbles)\n\t\t\t Should've skinned outta this long ago. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOLONIAL #2\n\t\t\tGot no families, Captain.

He comes up to her. She turns in surprise. \n\n\tCLOSER\n\n\tSomehow she breathes easier because he's there. She's in a white shirt with the sleeves\n\trolled up. Hawkeye leads her away from some of the people. \n\n\tCORA & HAWKEYE\n\n\tHawkeye takes Cora's hand. Cora is awakening to a new spirit, a new wind blowing\n\tthrough a new land, a new self-determination ... She's drawn to this rough yet graceful\n\tman with his direct manner. Hawkeye settles against a wall. She leans next to him.\n\tTheir shoulders touch. \n\n\tCORA\n\n\tTo her everything about him seems to be somehow right. She's discovered that the\n\tpassions and outrage that move him, move her ... And her readiness to give herself to\n\twhat stirs the deepest resonances of her soul is the same as his. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tlooks at her. She's beautiful in the firelight. Cora's eyes find his and she folds into his\n\tarms. His lips find hers and tears stream down her face. She's suffused with an elation\n\tshe can't explain. In the night before doomsday a romance is born in rebellion amid the\n\thuddled people in this small stockade ripped from the black earth of the forests of a\n\twild continent. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tINTERIOR BARRACKS - LOW & WIDE - DAY\n\n\tdoor CRASHES inwards.

Hawkeye drops his tomahawk\n\tand says something in Mohican to restrain Chingachgook and Uncas.

Hawkeye seperates himself from her and crosses to the window. \n\n\tEXTERIOR FORT, MAIN GATE - HAWKEYES POV: CHEVALIER DE LEVIS\n\n\tbows deeply to Major Beams. A French honor guard of five men is behind him. A white\n\tscarf is on his sword tip. The fresh destruction of the fort is apparent. Debris smolders. \n\n\tINTERIOR FORT - STOCKADE - HAWKEYE\n\n\tcrosses to an awakened Cora. He touches her face. He's desperate to drill these next\n\twords into her brain. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tWhat is it? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tI don't know. Whatever happens you stay \n\t\t\twith your father. You stay among the officers. \n\n\tCora looks up at Hawkeye. We feel forboding. O.S. are heard drums ... \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR FRENCH LINES - MUNRO, HEYWARD, BEAMS - DAY\n\n\tThe drums are from Munro's honor guard. They stop. \n\n\tREVERSE: FRENCH SOLDIERS\n\n\tMarquis de Montcalm, immaculate, backed by his guard of honor in white, grey and\n\tmedium blue with six foot by eight foot regimental colors and the French flag (gold\n\tfleur-de-lis on a field of blue). \n\n\tFACES\n\n\tThey carried two hundred and forty-five bateaux across a ten mile portage, all their\n\tsupplies and artillery, and then rowed down the length of Lake George to get here. To \tthem, assaulting this fort is the easy part. The drummers of the honor guard play a\n\ttattoo behind them. \n\n\tINDIAN FACES\n\n\tHuron, Ottawa, Osage, Choctaw, Fox ... hear the drum of the honor guard and wait.\n\tThey're in war paint. Many tattoos. Split ears. The Osage scalping locks are hennaed\n\tred. Canadiens among them are bearded, dirty, half savage ... At their head ... \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\tin full war paint, with a coterie of Huron warriors, silent, waiting. Drums. \n\n\tINTERIOR FORT - ENGLISH TROOPS (TABLEAUX)\n\n\tgrim, silent, watchful. \n\n\tCOLONIAL MILITIA & MOHAWK INDIANS IN WAR PAINT (TABLEAUX)\n\n\twatching the parlay from a blown apart battery. Silent. \n\n\tWIDE: FRENCH & ENGLISH\n\n\tand their honor guards. Montcalm steps forward and sweeps his plumed hat to the\n\tground in a courtly bow. Munro bows coldly. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tColonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant \n\t\t\tantagonist. I am happy to make your \n\t\t\tacquaintance as a friend. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tAnd I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tPlease accept my compliments for the strong \n\t\t\tand skillful defense of your fortress. Under \n\t\t\tthe command of a lesser man it would have \n\t\t\tfallen long ago given the superior numbers and \n\t\t\tmaterial ... mere chance has allowed me to \n\t\t\tarray against you ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tMonsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a \n\t\t\tdiplomat. You called this parlay for a reason. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tYou have already done everything which is \n\t\t\tnecessary for the honor of your Prince. I \n\t\t\twill forever bear testimony that your resistance \n\t\t\thas been gallant and was continued as long as \n\t\t\tthere was hope. But now, I beg you to listen \n\t\t\tto the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to \n\t\t\tconsider my terms for your surrender. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tHowever I may apprise such testimony from \n\t\t\tMonsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is \n\t\t\tstrong and stands. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tHonor that is freely accorded to courage, may \n\t\t\tbe refused obstinacy ... These hills afford to \n\t\t\tus every opportunity to reconnoiter your \n\t\t\tworks and I am possibly as well acquainted \n\t\t\twith your weak condition as you are yourselves. \n\n\tIs Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British\n\treinforcements arrive? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tPerhaps the General's glasses can reach to the \n\t\t\tHudson and he knows the size and imminence \n\t\t\tof the army of Webb ...? \n\n\tMontcalm takes a moment to reply and appears genuinely sympathetic to Munro. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\t\t(quietly)\n\t\t\tMy scouts intercepted this dispatch intended \n\t\t\tfor you. \n\n\tMunro is puzzled, suspicious. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\t\t(to Bougainville)\n\t\t\tRead the dispatch. \n\n\tHEYWARD & MUNRO]\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBOUGAINVILLE \n\t\t\t\t(O.S. - reading)\n\t\t\t\"Colonel Munro - Fort William Henry. I have \n\t\t\tno men available to send to your rescue. It is \n\t\t\timpossible. I  advise you to seek terms for \n\t\t\tsurrender. Signed Webb.\" \n\n\tMunro is rocked, as if struck by a blow. Bougainville hands Heyward the letter. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(confirming)\n\t\t\tThis is the signature of Webb. \n\t\t\t\t(to Munro)\n\t\t\tAnd I know the temper of our men. Rather \n\t\t\tthan spend the war in a French prison hulk \n\t\t\tin Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\t\t(to Montcalm)\n\t\t\t You have heard your answer, Monsieur le \n\t\t\tMarquis. \n\t\t\t\t(salutes) \n\n\tMunro starts off. Montcalm stops him. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tSir. \n\t\t\t\t(challengingly)\n\t\t\tI am incapable of mistreating brave men. \n\t\t\tI beg you not to sign the death warrant \n\t\t\tof so many until you have listened to my \n\t\t\tterms. \n\n\tMunro turns. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tSuch as ...? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tMy master requires the fort be destroyed. \n\t\t\tBut, for you and your comrades, there is \n\t\t\tno privilege that will be denied. None of \n\t\t\tyour men will see the inside of a prison\n\t\t\tbarge. They're free to go so long as they \n\t\t\treturn to England and fight no more on this\n\t\t\tcontinent, and the civilian militia return to \n\t\t\ttheir farms. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tTheir arms? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tThey may leave the fortress fully armed, but \n\t\t\twith no ammunition ... Other than that, ask \n\t\t\twhat you wish. \n\n\tMunro's impressed with Montcalm's generosity. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tThe honors of war? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tGranted. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tMy colors? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tCarry them to England to your King with pride. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tAllow me to consult with my officers. \n\n\tAs he turns away something's been disconnected inside Munro that can never get put\n\tback together. As the men move away from the French ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tI have lived to see two things I never expected. \n\t\t\tAn Englishman afraid to support a friend. And \n\t\t\ta Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tGeneral Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back \n\t\t\tand dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our \n\t\t\tmission is to fight. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\t\t(flares)\n\t\t\tDeath and honor are sometimes thought to be \n\t\t\tthe same. Today I have learned that they are not. \n\n\tMunro looks at the fortress behind him. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tSir! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\t\t(stops him with his eyes)\n\t\t\tThe decision is final. \n\n\tA beat. Then Munro turns toward Montcalm. Their eyes meet across the churned,\n\tscarred earth of the battlefield. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tI am deeply touched by such unusual and \n\t\t\tunexpected generosity ... The fort is yours \n\t\t\tunder the condition that we be given until \n\t\t\tdawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and \n\t\t\twomen for their march and turn our wounded \n\t\t\tover to your surgeon. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tGranted, Monsieur. \n\n\tAnd Montcalm bows deeply and as he does so ... \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR FRENCH LINES - CLOAKED MAN - NIGHT\n\n\tpasses away from the little city of tents in the direction of the beach and towards\n\tWilliam Henry. He seems to head towards a vantage point from which to observe the\n\tfort. As he approaches a sentry: \n\n\t\t\t\t\tSENTRY\n\t\t\tQui vive? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tFrance. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tSENTRY\n\t\t\tLe mot d'ordre? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tLa victoire. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tSENTRY\n\t\t\tC'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, \n\t\t\tmonsieur! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tIl est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant. \n\n\tThe cloak parts. By the light of the moon the man's face is dimly perceived by us and\n\tthe soldier as General Montcalm. The soldier snaps erect as Montcalm continues\n\twalking out beyond the line to a small stand of trees. \n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE: MONTCALM\n\n\tThe moon is broken into pieces of light on the water and behind Montcalm; from the\n\tfront of the stand of trees emerges a tall figure.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tIs the hatchet buried between the English \n\t\t\tand my French father? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tYes. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tNot a warrior has a scalp and the white men \n\t\t\tbecome friends. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tMy master owns these lands and your father \n\t\t\thas been ordered to drive off the English \n\t\t\tsquatters. They have consented to go. So \n\t\t\tnow he calls them enemies no longer. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tMagua took the hatchet to color it with blood. \n\t\t\tIt is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will \n\t\t\tbe buried. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tBut so many suns have set since Le Renard \n\t\t\tstruck the war post. Is he not tired? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tWhere is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill. \n\t\t\tIt is dark and cold. It has set on his people, \n\t\t\tthey are fooled and kill all the animals and sell \n\t\t\tall of their lands to enrich the European masters \n\t\t\twho are always greedy for more than they need. \n\t\t\t\t(threatening)\n\t\t\tAnd Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have \n\t\t\tbeen many clouds and many mountains. But now\n\t\t\the has come to lead his nation. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tThat Le Renard has the power to lead his people \n\t\t\tinto the light, I know well. \n\n\tMagua grabs the hand of the French commander. Imperceptible surprise in Montcalm's\n\teyes. Magua jams Montcalm's fingers to his chest. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tDoes my father know that? \n\n\tMAGUA'S CHEST\n\n\tA deep indentation and scar. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tThat's where a lead bullet has torn you. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tAnd this? \n\n\tMagua turns his naked back to Montcalm and puts Montcalm's hand on his back ... \tdeep ridges of a scar a half inch wide.] \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tMy son has been sadly injured. Who did \n\t\t\tthis? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\t\t(laughs; sardonic)\n\t\t\tMagua slept hard in the English wigwams. \n\t\t\tAnd the sticks left their mark ... \n\t\t\t\t(pause; for real)\n\t\t\tMagua's village and lodges were burnt. \n\t\t\tMagua's children were killed by the English. \n\t\t\tMagua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks \n\t\t\twho fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife \n\t\t\tbelieved he was dead and became the wife of \n\t\t\tanother. The Grey Hair was the father of all \n\t\t\tthis. \n\t\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\t\tIn time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk \n\t\t\tto become free. In his heart he always was Huron. \n\t\t\tAnd his heart will be whole again on the day \n\t\t\twhen the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tMy son Magua's pain is my pain. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tDoes the chief of the Canadas believe the \n\t\t\tEnglish will keep the terms? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tMunro would. But General Webb will not\n\t\t\tsend their soldiers across the salt lake. \n\t\t\tHaving let them go, I fear I will only fight \n\t\t\tthe same men again when I move south.\n\t\t\t\t(pause; shrugs)\n\t\t\tAnd yet, I cannot break the terms of the \n\t\t\tcapitulation and sully the lilies of France ... \n\n\tLong pause, wheels turn. Then: \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tMany things my French father cannot do, \n\t\t\tMagua can. \n\n\tMontcalm reacts as if he hadn't thought of that. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMONTCALM\n\t\t\tAs the English march away, our soldiers \n\t\t\tand the Canadiens will be drawn to the \n\t\t\tlooting of the fort ... except for a small \n\t\t\tguard ... \n\n\tMagua abruptly leaves Montcalm. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR WOODS - MAGUA - NIGHT\n\n\twalking back to the Huron camp. Reveal a Huron sub-chief has been in the woods,\n\twaiting for Magua. Now he joins him. They walk in silence. Then ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\t\t(in Iroquois; re: Montcalm)\n\t\t\tI wonder at the blindness and pride of the \n\t\t\twhite man. He believes only he knows \n\t\t\thow to speak falsely to make other men do \n\t\t\this bidding. \n\n\tMagua exhales in derision. \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR FORT, MAIN GATE - MUNRO - DAY\n\n\tat the end of the column, rides out on his horse. Both sides of the gate are jammed with\n\tarmed French troops standing at attention. The French colors and honor guard are just\n\toutside the gate along with Bougainville, Chevalier de Levis, both on horseback as \n\tis - at the head - Montcalm. \n\n\tCLOSER: MUNRO\n\n\ttrots past his walking column out the gate. He does not look at the French. \n\n\tMONTCALM\n\n\tsalutes Munro and bows gravely from the saddle. \n\n\tCLOSER: MUNRO\n\n\tsalutes Montcalm.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\t\t(eyes forward)\n\t\t\tMonsieur, the fort is yours. \n\n\tMID-COLUMN - ON HEYWARD\n\n\tmarching with his 33rd Regiment of Foot well beyond the fort. The French troops have\n\tthinned out. Repressing shame, his backbone is rigid, his face is straight ahead. The\n\t33rd marches in perfect cadence to the drum. In the B.G. Munro on his horse passes\n\tHeyward as he rides towards the front of his column. Heyward does not look at him. \n\n\tFRONT OF COLUMN - CORA WITH ALICE\n\n\ton the back of a mare. Alice, living through a wide-awake nightmare, is huddled under\n\tthe arm of her sister. They ride behind the standard bearers. In the B.G. her father is\n\tseen approaching and takes his position at their side. Cora looks down the column,\n\tsheilding her eyes against the sun. We know who she's looking for ... Hawkeye. \n\n\tCORA'S POV: THE COLUMN\n\n\tThe 62nd and 42nd Highlanders including Heyward ... thirty to forty women and a\n\tnumber of children - for safety - in the middle, some frontiersmen, Ongewasgone and\n\tmany Mohawk, walking wounded. The column is still snaking its way out of the fort.\n\tNo Hawkeye. \n\n\tCORA\n\n\tstraining to see. \n\n\tEXTERIOR FORT - PRISONERS\n\n\tbeing assembled, their hands shackled. Hawkeye is among twelve or thirteen. He stands\n\terect, walking out of the gate. The French are starting to pour in to loot the interior.\n\tHawkeye looks to his left about twenty paces in front of him and sees ... \n\n\tUNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK\n\n\ton the other side of the column. Chingachgook cradles Killdeer as well as his own\n\tmusket. They fall back to walk beside the prisoners on the other side of Hawkeye.\n\tTheir eyes connect... We don't expect Hawkeye to stay shackled for the duration. \n\n\tRANK AND FILE FRENCH\n\n\tA few insults. The British soldiers answer. Nobody breaks rank. It's just talk. \n\n\tEXTERIOR ROAD - HAWKEYE\n\n\tHis eyes sweep the column snaking its way into the v-shaped valley. The path cuts\n\tthrough the forested hills ahead. He sees ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S DISTANT POV: CORA\n\n\triding near the front where there are no more French soldiers. Only a few scattered and\n\tcurious Huron and Ottawa. She does not see him. \n\n\tPROFILE OF COLUMN - HIGH & WIDE\n\n\tas it passes left to right below like a long snake through the narrow valley. We're\n\tshooting from inside the dark woods. Lower, in the light, we see a scattering on both\n\tslopes of a couple of hundred Ottawa and Huron. They are in no order, are spread out\n\tand don't constitute a threat. They watch the column. \n\tSLOWLY THE CAMERA ... slides across the shoulders and back of a large man\n\twearing black plumes in his scalp-lock and other than a breechcloth is almost naked. He\n\tis heavily war-painted ... \n\n\tFRONTAL - MAGUA\n\n\tand the left two-thirds of his face is painted red. The right third is painted black. Much\n\tsilver is in his ears. His tomahawk is in his left hand. His cut-down musket in his right\n\tfist. Magua's attention is all focused to one point. \n\n\tMAGUA'S LONG & TIGHT POV: MUNRO & CORA & ALICE\n\n\tat the head of the column. This is the focus of Magua's attention. \n\n\tWIDE FRONTAL: COLUMN, STANDARD BEARERS & MUNROS\n\n\tCora turns again to look for Hawkeye. \n\n\tCLOSER: CORA\n\n\tdoesn't see him, but something else has caught her eye. \n\n\tYOUNG HURON\n\n\trunning toward the column. Just one man. No musket. He's running and whooping like\n\ta dog charging from his master's front yard. Why? \n\n\tCLOSER\n\n\tthe Huron arrives at the column, his tomahawk swings into his hand and he brains a\n\tBritish trooper who falls dead. The single Huron never breaks stride. He simply runs off\n\tagain ... \n\n\tCORA\n\n\thorrified, holds Alice tighter. \n\n\tMUNRO\n\n\thas seen it too. And now he sees ... \n\n\t62ND REGIMENT OF FOOT\n\n\tfixing bayonets. A large sergeant unsheathes a two-handed claymore, facing the Hurons\n\tand other Indians ... \n\n\tTROOPERS\n\n\tof the 33rd present arms. Did they violate the surrender by carrying ammunition? Locks\n\tare cocked. There's the answer. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tSteady! No one fires! \n\n\tEXTERIOR FORESTED HILLSIDES - OTHER TRIBES\n\n\tare watching what happens. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tscanning them. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(to Sergeant Major)\n\t\t\tMen are to stay in file, Sergeant Major! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tSERGEANT MAJOR\n\t\t\tYes sir! \n\n\tDrums beat the cadence.\n\n\tTROOPERS\n\n\tstep over the fallen soldier. Heads turn, they're on edge ... \n\n\tEND OF COLUMN - HAWKEYE, UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK\n\n\twatching. They exchange looks. This is not good. Chingachgook cocks both Killdeer\n\tand his own musket. \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S POV: FORESTED SLOPES\n\n\tHold. We start to make out details in the shadow. Tree trunks. We become accustomed\n\tto the dimness. Now in the lower light we see deeper in the forest. \n\n\tCLOSER\n\n\tMany Huron and Ottawa are hidden in the shadows. They're moving along parallel to\n\tthe column, stalking it. Waiting ... \n\n\tANOTHER BRAVE\n\n\tracing down the hill from the opposite flank towards the 62nd. \n\n\tTWO SOLDIERS\n\n\tlook at their sergeant. He nods. They wait until he's within ten feet of the column. Both\n\tbayonet the Indian. He's dead. \n\n\tEXTERIOR HILLSIDES - HURON & OTTAWA\n\n\tsaw what happened. But, they hold their ranks. \n\n\tMOHAWKS\n\n\tamong the British are slipping tomahawks into their hands, surreptitiously. Some are\n\tcocking flintlocks. \n\n\tMUNRO\n\n\tgallops his horse away from Cora and Alice towards the scene of the last attack. We\n\thear him from the distance ordering ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tDo not break ranks! I want these ranks \n\t\t\tto hold ...! \n\n\tCora's frightened.\n\n\tHAWKEYE'S\n\n\tfrustrated. He saw Munro leave Cora. He knows events have a momentum and it's\n\taccelerating. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS\n\n\tmove next to the sergeant with the shackle keys who looks at them curiously as ... \n\n\tWOMEN\n\n\twith children nervously search the threatening trees, hoping against hope these are\n\tisolated incidents. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tdraws his sword and is passing orders to his sergeant major, scanning the hills ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR FORESTED SLOPE - MAGUA\n\n\tHis eyes see Munro. \n\n\tWIDER & LOWER: MAGUA\n\n\traises his musket in his fist and emits a war whoop. WE NOW SEE ... hundreds have\n\tbeen stalking the column, hidden in the trees, maybe thousands. Then ... \n\n\tWIDE: ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE\n\n\tFIRE from the trees crescendos within seconds revealing a spontaneous and massive\n\tambush of mostly Hurons. They appear from behind every tree and it turns to a ROAR\n\tof musket fire, war whoops and screams as ... \n\n\tSOLDIERS & CIVILIANS\n\n\tdropping like flies and seemingly thousands of Hurons attack down both slopes. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tis being unshackled by Uncas. The sergeant is rising from the ground where\n\tChingachgook knocked him. Chingachgook throws Hawkeye Killdeer and Hawkeye\n\tshrugs into his pouch and powder horn as he races with Uncas for the head of the\n\tcolumn ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR FORESTED SLOPE - MAGUA\n\n\tcharging down the hill ... with his coterie of twenty Huron warriors, heading for the\n\tarea in which he saw Munro. \n\n\tCORA & ALICE\n\n\tat the head of the disintegrating column. Cora's holding Alice's head to her bosom,\n\tcovering her ears as if to protect her from the sounds. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tshouting orders. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tSERGEANT MAJOR\n\t\t\tRight - about face! March!

(IMPORTANT: the combined musket fire of Hurons, English and\n\tMohawks generates tremendous clouds of smoke which obscure action, close off\n\tviews, isolate pockets of combat into surreal tableaux that we'll move in and out of.\n\n\tBRITISH TROOPERS\n\n\tusing their useless muskets as clubs or with fixed bayonets - as the smoke and fog\n\tswirls among the men - fighting for their lives ... \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\tglides through the scenes, striking and hunting. Some of his coterie of braves near him.\n\tHe sees ... \n\n\tBLONDE WOMAN\n\n\thugging the ground in fear. Magua throws her over. It's not Alice Munro. It's a woman\n\tprotecting her baby. Magua walks on. One of the braves behind Magua raise his\n\ttomahawk. On his downswing ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\trunning through surreal patches, thinks he glimpses Cora two hundred yards away. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tCora! \n\n\tChingachgook, on Hawkeye's left, slams down two Hurons with his war club. \n\n\tCORA & ALICE\n\n\trunning through the chaos and murder and British troopers and Mohawks locked in\n\tstruggle with Hurons. Cora's dress is torn. She holds Alice to her. There's a pistol in\n\tCora's hand. \n\n\tONE HURON\n\n\tscalping a prone soldier, rips the trophy from his head, turns and faces us. \n\n\tCORA\n\n\tshoots him in the face. \n\n\tEXTREMELY CLOSE: ALICE\n\n\tand her eyes take it all in. And her affect starts to flatten. A blankness suffuses her\n\texpression and the girl withdraws from this reality into a deep dark cave inside her\n\thead. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tlocked in combat. He tomahawks one Huron's arm with a slashing downstroke and\n\tcomes right back into the face of the second with his backswing while his right hand\n\tfires Killdeer at ... \n\n\tHURON\n\n\tsix feet from Uncas and about to shoot him in the back. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tfree for a moment, spins. He has no idea of direction any more. Everything is death in\n\tstrange tableaux. Meanwhile: \n\n\tMUNRO\n\n\thollering\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMUNRO\n\t\t\tCora! Alice! \n\n\tHe cuts down a Huron with his sword who is trying to leap at him from the right. An\n\tOsage warrior with red scalp-lock leaps on the back of Munro's horse, reaching over to\n\tstab down into Munro's neck. The old man's left hand grabs the warrior's knife hand in\n\tan iron grip. His right hand pulls his horse pistol and under his upraised arm fires\n\tbackward, point blank, blowing the Osage off the back of his horse. \n\n\tWIDER\n\n\tJust then Munro's mount is shot. His horse rears up, throws Munro and falls on him. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tshouting orders over the deafening noise.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tSecond rank fire! Six paces back! Prime! \n\t\t\tLoad! Third rank! Present! \n\n\tA well-oiled, well-drilled fighting machine, but there are fewer of them. They're getting\n\tcut off. They close ranks automatically as a man drops. They're retreating in perfect\n\torder. \n\n\tHURON WARRIOR\n\n\tabout to strike a downwards blow is pushed aside by Magua. \n\n\tCLOSER: MAGUA\n\n\tHis eyes drop to what's in front of him. The field goes quiet. \n\n\tOVER MAGUA'S SHOULDER: MUNRO\n\n\this lower body is trapped under his dead horse. Magua leans in towards him. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tGrey Hair. I will cut your heart from your \n\t\t\tliving chest in front of your eyes. As you die, \n\t\t\tknow that I will put under the knife your \n\t\t\tchildren and wipe your seed from this earth \n\t\t\tforever ... \n\n\tMagua pulls his knife and as he leans down towards Munro ... \n\n\tMOHAWK & HURON\n\n\tspin and flail furiously at each other with tomahawks and knives. The Huron goes down\n\tand then the Mohawk is shot. The Huron who shot him is cut down by a Ranger with\n\ttomahawk in one hand and bayonet in the other. Two Mohawks and three Rangers\n\tfighting back to back. They become an island swamped by Huron and Ottawa: amidst\n\tbodies and ground slippery with blood. As smoke obscures their image. \n\n\tCORA & ALICE\n\n\tin a group of civilian militia. Two of the militiamen are shot down. The third engages a\n\tFox warrior. Cora & Alice run. \n\n\tMUNRO'S FACE\n\n\tfrozen in agony by shock. \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\treaching down and up into something, emerges and jams an object we barely see into\n\tthe air. But his arm and shoulder and half his chest are splashed red with blood. \n\n\tLONG SHOT: MAGUA\n\n\tseen from far away, holding aloft the heart of Munro. \n\n\tREVERSE: HAWKEYE\n\n\tsaw him and fights his way to attack when ... \n\n\tWHITE HORSE\n\n\tcrazed, CRASHES through men, knocking Hawkeye over ... \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tprotecting Hawkeye, slams his war club into one Huron, breaking his attack, his arm\n\tand his skull and swings the other way burying the bladed end into the chest of an\n\tOttawa who's behind him. Then ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S\n\n\tup, looking wildly ... \n\n\tCAMERA JAMS INTO CLEARING SMOKE:\n\n\t33rd Regiment of Foot and Heyward. They FIRE into our face. \n\n\tCLOSER: HEYWARD\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tSix paces back! Prime! Load! Rank two, \n\t\t\tpresent! Rank two, hold! \n\n\tHe grabs a partially loaded musket, the ramrod still in the barrel. They're taking fire.\n\tMen are dying. They're being pushed back. \n\n\tAN ABNAKI\n\n\twearing a large cross, attacks Heyward from the side. One-handed, Heyward fires the\n\tmusket into the man's chest, sending the ramrod through him. Then Heyward's shot in\n\tthe thigh and a thrown tomahawk hits him in the head and knocks him sideways.\n\tDazed. Barely able to stand. He uses the musket as a cane and ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tRank two, six paces back! Rank one, \n\t\t\tpresent! \n\n\tRank two did not retreat six paces. They stand in confusion. Heyward looks to see\n\twhat's wrong. \n\n\tHEYWARD'S POV: THE REMNANTS OF THE 33RD REGIMENT OF FOOT\n\n\tare standing in water. They're up against Lake George. Their backs are to the wall. Last\n\tstand. Heyward straightens. \n\n\tTWO FRENCH OFFICERS\n\n\ton horseback try to intercede in the slaughter of five women. One French officer is shot\n\tby a Huron. The other French officer runs through that Huron and shoots the second.\n\tThen his horse is shot out from under him and he goes down ... \n\n\tJESUIT\n\n\tpleads with an Abnaki to give up a child he's holding by the legs in one hand. He offers\n\this cross. The Abnaki throws the baby to the Jesuit, Pere Roubaud. \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tsees a flash of something yellow. So does Hawkeye. They charge into the swirling\n\tchaos of attacking bodies. As we lose sight of them ... \n\n\tALICE\n\n\ton her hands and knees. A massive Ottawa pulls her upright by her hair about to take\n\ther life and her scalp. He's struck by a rock in the hands of Cora which barely phases\n\thim. He bats her aside and returns to Alice, when suddenly ... \n\n\tOTTAWA WARRIOR\n\n\tis spun, punched and tomahawked into the ground by Hawkeye. Uncas has Alice and\n\tCora ... \n\n\tTWO RANGERS AND A MOHAWK WARRIOR\n\n\tfrom the earlier group are nearby. They combine with Hawkeye to fight their way out\n\t with bayonets and tomahawks. \n\n\tHAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, TWO RANGERS, A MOHAWK &\n\tMUNRO'S DAUGHTERS\n\n\tback through the swirling smoke. There seems to be a lull. Then they're hit from the\n\tside by musket fire. One of the Rangers is shot, the other wounded. Hurons attack. The\n\tMohawk supports the wounded Ranger. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tshields Cora as they back up. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tsmashing his war club straight down on a Huron, reaches for the man's musket and\n\tshoots another. Then he sees ... \n\n\tSMOKE DRIFTING OVER WATER\n\n\tIt's glass-smooth. And the bows are barely visible of three or four Huron war canoes. \n\n\tTHE SHALLOWS - HAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK, UNCAS, CORA, ALICE,\n\tTHE RANGER & THE MOHAWK\n\n\tback into the water. They're pursued by Ottawa and Hurons as they fight their way to\n\tthe canoes. \n\n\tCORA\n\n\theld up by Hawkeye, suddenly screams. \n\n\tANGLE\n\n\tsomething underwater is pulling her down. An Ottawa brave rockets out of the\n\tshallows. Before he's erect, Hawkeye slams him back into the water and FIRES. \n\n\tWOUNDED RANGER\n\n\thas shoved a large birch canoe at them. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tSuddenly, the Mohawk fighting with them is shot and spins to face Hawkeye. His hands\n\trest on Hawkeye's shoulders. Hawkeye looks into his face. Tries to hold him up, tries\n\tto rescue him. A frozen moment. Hawkeye's staring into his eyes and the man is staring\n\tinto Hawkeye's as the light goes out ... Hawkeye lets him slide into the water and float\n\taway. He moves Cora and Alice towards the canoe ... \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tEXTERIOR LAKE GEORGE - WATER & SWIRLING SMOKE - DAY\n\n\tThe bottom of the frame is water like glass. Smoke obscures the background. Fingers\n\ttendril towards us. Out of the mist we HEAR small splashing and then the high bow of\n\ta war canoe defines itself. It's paddled towards us. \n\n\tHAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS\n\n\tCora's behind Hawkeye. Alice and the wounded Ranger are near Uncas. \n\n\tCLOSER: HAWKEYE & CORA\n\n\tCora looks left. Her eyes go wide. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tNo! \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tspins. \n\n\tHEYWARD & TWO TROOPERS OF THE 33RD IN A SECOND CANOE\n\n\thave emerged from the smoke ten feet from them. Heyward's aiming a horse pistol at\n\tHawkeye. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tis non-plussed. He doesn't stop paddling. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tYou got nothin' better to do today on \n\t\t\tLake George than shoot me, Major,\n\t\t\tthen go ahead ... \n\n\tHeyward's a hair's breadth from firing. Suddenly they hear the boom of muskets and\n\trounds come in. \n\n\tWIDE\n\n\tThey're being pursued by three boatloads - and then a fourth and fifth - of Huron. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tis indifferent to Huron musket balls. Hawkeye hasn't stopped paddling and pays\n\tHeyward no heed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tStop it!! \n\n\tHeyward comes to his senses. His head is gashed. A scarf, as a tourniquet, is tied\n\taround his leg. He lowers the gun. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tWhen you fall into British hands again, \n\t\t\tNathaniel Poe, I will have you hanged. \n\n\tHURON CANOES\n\n\tpaddle hard and deep and the canoes power across the lake. \n\n\tHAWKEYE & HEYWARD'S CANOES\n\n\twith less paddlers, plus wounded, are slower and will be overtaken. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tlooks to Uncas. They both realize the same thing. Hawkeye nods and he, Uncas &\n\tChingachgook begin to paddle furiously. The others match the doubled pace. They're\n\tsprinting ahead but the effort is exhausting. \n\n\tHURON CANOES\n\n\tmaintain their steady pace. Three or four Hurons fire. \n\n\tHAWKEYE'S CANOE\n\n\tMusket balls ricochet on the water's surface. One rips a hole through the bow.\n\tHawkeye sees one of the Redcoats in Heyward's canoe is giving out ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tREDCOAT #1\n\t\t\tCan't ... keep it up ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tPull! \n\n\tHe renews the attack on the water with the paddle.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\t\t(shouts)\n\t\t\tHow long? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(shouts)\n\t\t\tOnly chance we got is ... \n\t\t\t\t(breathless)\n\t\t\t ... to get more distance on 'em and go \n\t\t\tto ground! \n\n\tHeyward digs in. Like firecrackers in the distance, Huron muskets sound. A new hail\n\tof musket balls cut the fabric of the canoes. One Redcoat is shot in the back. He falls\n\toverboard.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(shouts)\n\t\t\tPull!!\n\n\tHAWKEYE CANOE\n\n\tsprints forward. \n\n\tCLOSE: HAWKEYE\n\n\tlooks over his shoulder. \n\n\tTHE HURON CANOES\n\n\tThey're pulling away from them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tPull ...! \n\n\tMore Huron musket balls hit water nearby. \n\n\tREDCOAT\n\n\tin Heyward's boat is shot. BUT ... the .65 caliber ball didn't penetrate his skin. The\n\tRedcoat - amazed - picks it off the floor of the canoe. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tREDCOAT #2\n\t\t\tSpent. \n\n\tDistance caught up with eighteenth century ballistics. They're out of smoothbore\n\tmusket range. \n\n\tHAWKEYE CANOE]\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(to Heyward)\n\t\t\tHead for ... for the white water. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tDo you hear me, sir! \n\t\t\t\t(exhausted)\n\t\t\tIf you ever fall ... into British hands ...\n\t\t\t\t(breathes)\n\t\t\tWhat white water? \n\n\tHEYWARD & REDCOAT'S POV: LAKE\n\n\tdivided by a spit of land. The right fork becomes a river with white water rapids. \n\n\tHAWKEYE CANOE - HAWKEYE\n\n\tpaddling now, too, as they furiously jam for the white water that will shoot them way\n\tahead of the Hurons. \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tleaps off the stern of Hawkeye's canoe and climbs up the stern of Heyward's and takes\n\tcontrol. He roughly gestures to the Redcoat and the Major to stop paddling. He and\n\tHawkeye will pilot the two canoes. \n\n\tEXTERIOR WHITE WATER - WIDE - DAY\n\n\tThe canoes enter the white water and they're so light, they're jet-propelled. \n\n\tCANOE POV: EIGHT FOOT WAVE\n\n\tracing in the same direction they are. They hit it straight on and it shoots over them and\n\tthey're drenched by two waves coming from the sides. \n\n\tHAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tpaddle like fiends to get momentum and control. \n\n\tUNCAS' CANOE\n\n\tSame thing. When they crested the wave Uncas hollers at them to \"pull\" and they do.\n\tAs soon as they're through it, Uncas slams the paddle in the water and makes the canoe\n\trevolve a hundred and eighty degrees in a vortex so that now it's going through \n\tstern-first or the stern becomes the bow, so that Uncas could pilot it a different way\n\tthrough a hazard of ... \n\n\tEXPOSED ROCKS\n\n\tjutting out of the water. \n\n\tWIDE - BOTH CANOES\n\n\tHawkeye didn't have to turn because Chingachgook, at the bow, uses his paddle to\n\tshove the canoe away from jutting rocks. Uncas does the same. Past the jutting rocks,\n\tUncas swings it back around while ... \n\n\tWHITE WATER\n\n\tsmashes into the camera. \n\n\tALICE & CORA\n\n\tas the canoe roller-coasters and water bursts the bow. Then suddenly it's through and\n\tthe water is miraculously smooth. \n\n\tCANOES\n\n\tThe Ranger, the Redcoats and even Heyward feel the exhilaration of the ride. That's\n\tbecause they think they're home free.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tHere's where it gets tricky ... \n\n\tHeyward turns to look in front of him. He doesn't know what the hell Hawkeye's\n\ttalking about. \n\n\tHEYWARD'S POV: THE RIVER AHEAD\n\n\tlooks glass-smoth. Although there is a distant ROAR of sorts. Then Heyward realizes:\n\tsomething's wrong with this picture. \n\n\tCLOSER: HEYWARD\n\n\tThe look on his face starts to change. \n\n\tHEYWARD'S POV: TIGHTER\n\n\tThe glass surface of the river continues to a line then falls off the end of the world. The\n\triver just ends ... \n\n\tBOTH CANOES: HEYWARD, REDCOATS, THE RANGER\n\n\trealize they're heading for the lip of a waterfall. There's a couple of outcroppings of\n\trock in the center at the very edge. We are at Glen Falls.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tDon't move ... \n\n\tAERIAL SHOT\n\n\tfrom the other side of the falls. It's a two hundred foot high, death-defying cataract.\n\tThe canoes - slightly above us - will go right over. \n\n\tTWO CANOES\n\n\tAt the last moment, Hawkeye & Uncas land both on either side of the larger rock\n\toutcropping. It is literally at the lip of the falls. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tgrabs a rock to anchor the bow of the canoe. He loses his grip. The canoe rockets for\n\tthe edge. \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tlurches sideways, grabs a tree root. He is the only link of the canoe to earth. The bow,\n\twith Heyward, is literally hanging over the edge. Uncas strains and pulls the canoe to\n\tthe rock. He gestures to Heyward. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tcrawls forward and makes the island. Then the two Redcoats. Finally Uncas. The canoe\n\trockets over the falls. Meanwhile ... \n\n\tTHE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND\n\n\tHawkeye has beached his canoe and is camouflaging it with driftwood and brush. As\n\tthey clamber over the high pieces of broken limestone, we see Hawkeye is slipping into\n\ta crevice. He motions to Cora. Uncas carries the wounded Ranger. Heyward helps\n\tAlice ... \n\n\tCUT TO ...\n\n\tINTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVES - FISSURE - TWILIGHT\n\n\tThe irregular opening of medium blue sky is obscured by the black silhouetted forms of\n\tHawkeye, Cora and then the others entering.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tWhere do we go from here? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tWe don't. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tI don't understand! \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tThis is it, as far as we can go ... If we're \n\t\t\tlucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have \n\t\t\tcome this way and must've beached our \n\t\t\tcanoes and headed cross land. If we're \n\t\t\tvery lucky, they'll figure we went over \n\t\t\tthe falls. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tThen what? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tThen we take the south rim down the \n\t\t\tmountain and it's 12 miles cross country \n\t\t\tto Fort Edward. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tAnd if we're unlucky? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tYou will have to forego the pleasure of \n\t\t\thangin' me. \n\n\tREVERSE: WIDE\n\n\tHawkeye helps Cora; Heyward, the Ranger. Chingachgook carries Alice, down the\n\trockface into a cave. We hear a distant ROAR reverberating off the walls. \n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE: THE WALLS\n\n\tare scooped out, bone-like hollows eroded by tumbling water. At an earlier time the\n\tformation was part of the falls. \n\n\tHAWKEYE & CORA\n\n\treach the irregular floor of the chamber. The ROAR is louder. \n\n\tWIDEN TO REVEAL\n\n\ta curtain of falling water. They're behind the cataract, probably a third of the way down\n\tits height. Light through the water stikes them with a silver luminescence. They're\n\texhausted. The others join them. They almost have to shout to be heard. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tfollowed by Uncas, takes stock of their supplies. They check their powder. They have\n\talmost none. Uncas shares his with Hawkeye. The Redcoat's cartridge case is soaked,\n\tthe paper cartridges a soggy mess. Heyward has none. The Ranger has two left. In\n\tMohican, Chingachgook decides some things. Hawkeye and Uncas nod. Heyward\n\tapproaches Hawkeye.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHEYWARD\n\t\t\tAny powder? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE:\n\t\t\t\t(crossing to Cora)\n\t\t\tOnly one or two loads. \n\n\tCORA\n\n\tis soaked to the bones. Hawkeye strips off his buckskin hunting shirt and wrings it out.\n\tCora turns her back, strips off her white blouse and puts on the faster-drying chamois. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tAre we safe? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tMaybe ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tOur father? Did you see my father? \n\n\tEXTREME CLOSE UP: HAWKEYE\n\n\tThe look on his face tells it all \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tTell me! \n\n\tTWO SHOT\n\n\tHawkeye takes Cora away from the group and turns her by her shoulders and whispers\n\tto her. We don't hear what he says. Cora drops to her knees and places her hands over\n\ther eyes and face like a little girl trying to make something bad go away. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tLeads her to a depression, his arm around her shoulders, her face covered and she cries\n\tsoftly into his shoulder. \n\n\tEXTREME CLOSE UP: CORA\n\n\tsays into Hawkeye's ear, after she looks O.S. ...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCORA\n\t\t\tSay nothing to Alice ...! \n\n\tHawkeye nods.\n\n\tALICE\n\n\tstands in the chamber not far from the wall of water, fascinated with its shimmer. She's\n\toblivious to all the events and everything going on around her ... \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tsees Cora & Hawkeye together and turns away. \n\n\tGROUP\n\n\tUncas watches Alice. The wounded Ranger has fallen asleep. The Redcoat is\n\texhausted. Hawkeye & Cora against the wall. \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR RIVER BANK - RIVER FALLS ARE IN MIST & RED SKY -\n\tTWILIGHT\n\n\tA landscape with mist rearlit by the red light of the sun that's already behind the\n\tmountains. The blues are turning purple and the greens are turning black and the white\n\thighlights of the foaming water are going rose. Reflecting the darkening sky, where the\n\tsurface isn't broken, the water is fast-moving metal ... SUDDENLY: a shaved head and\n\tmuscled back stands into the foreground. It moves down the shore away from camera.\n\tHe's followed by other Huron warriors. They're two hundred yards away from Glen\n\tFalls island. \n\n\tHURON\n\n\tlooks at the island of rock & trees and tilts his head curiously ... \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR FOREST ABOVE CANYON & FALLS - GREY WOLF - TWILIGHT\n\n\twatches the Hurons below make their way towards the edge of the falls. \n\n\tOVER HIS SHOULDER: THREE MORE WOLVES\n\n\tjoin him, moving frenetically, uneasily ... The leader of the pack looks up & howls as\n\this eyes go white reflecting the new moon. \n\n\tINTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVE - HAWKEYE -NIGHT\n\n\thears the distant howl. He's now lit silver blue by the moonlight through the falling\n\twater. Hawkeye knows it means Hurons are out there. He exchanges worried glances\n\twith Uncas & Chingachgook. \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\timmediately starts up the right acclivity to one fissure, and Chingachgook moves\n\tcarefully to the first fissure. Hawkeye follows. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\tHis countenance gives way momentarily. All his experience seems of no avail. He\n\ttouches the side of Cora's face. Grabs Killdeer and follows Chingachgook. \n\n\tALICE\n\n\tsensing new danger, slips away on her own. \n\n\tCORA\n\n\tcrosses to the Ranger who's semi-conscious, feverish and getting delirious. She can't do\n\ta thing except hold his hand and think of her father. \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tINTERIOR SOUTH FISSURE - HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tbelow the edge, listen & wait, testing the environment with all their senses ... \n\n\tNORTH FISSURE - UNCAS\n\n\tagainst one wall, has his ear cocked, monitoring, facing away from the sky ... \n\n\tALICE\n\n\tlooks at the sky through the fissure. She sees the starfields and feels silver moonlight\n\tpull her forward. She starts out onto the island, oblivious, unaware she'll expose them.\n\tSuddenly ... \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tyanks her down next to him. He pulls her head into his chest, looking out over the\n\tedge, his tomahawk in front of him, his musket near his right hand.

Uncas tries to restrain her. \n\n\tALICE'S\n\n\teyes slowly open. Oblivion disappears. It's replaced with escalating fear. She holds onto\n\tUncas with desperation. Her fingers claw his shoulders.

Then she's flooded with shame. He reaches for her. She jerks away. He\n\treaches for her again and clutches her to him. And she breaks down. Then he turns her\n\tface to him, but her expression has completely flattened. \n\n\tWIDER ANGLE\n\n\tShe's not a lover to Uncas now.

He\n\twears numerous silver & gold medals, gifts of French, English and Dutch governors.\n\tMost startling is his face. His dark & lined skin is enhanced by delicate lines of\n\ttatooing.

Because the \n\t\t\tHurons are mislead by the words of the \n\t\t\twolf who's never spoken the truth.\n\n\tSachem gestures with his hand to Magua. Magua reluctantly stops advancing on\n\tHawkeye. Heyward's French translation has faded to a murmur. We hear Hawkeye's\n\tEnglish.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tLet the children of the dead Colonel Munro \n\t\t\tgo free and take the fire out of the English \n\t\t\tanger over the murder of their helpless ones. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\t\t(to Sachem)\n\t\t\tOur father, Montcalm, is greater than the \n\t\t\tYengeese in the arts of war. The Huron \n\t\t\tdo not fear English anger. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(to Sachem)\n\t\t\tWise one, the French fathers made peace \n\t\t\tand swore to their honor not to break the \n\t\t\tfriendship. Magua broke it. It is false that \n\t\t\tthe French would not be friends, still, to \n\t\t\tthe Huron. \n\n\tSachem reacts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\t\tIt made our French father happy to never \n\t\t\thave to fight the same Yengeese again. \n\t\t\tHe told me this without telling me this. \n\n\tHawkeye realizes this is true.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tSo the Huron are the servants of the French? \n\t\t\tTo do what the French are shamed to do? \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\tNo. \n\t\t\t\t(to Sachem)\n\t\t\tHuron serve no one. The French father \n\t\t\tbelieves he fooled Magua because he is so \n\t\t\tproud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it \n\t\t\tis the Huron path that Magua walks down, \n\t\t\tnot the French one ... Now, Les Francais, \n\t\t\talso, fear Huron. That is good. When the \n\t\t\tHuron is strong from their fear, we will make \n\t\t\tthe terms of trade with Les Francais. And we \n\t\t\twill trade as the white man trades. Take land \n\t\t\tfrom the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk \n\t\t\t& Fox. And make the Huron great. Over \n\t\t\tother tribes. No less than the whites, as strong \n\t\t\tas the whites. \n\n\tHawkeye appears to be losing his debate with Magua.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\t\t(to Sachem)\n\t\t\tMagua would use the ways of Les Francais \n\t\t\tand the Yengeese ... \n\n\t\t\t\t\tMAGUA\n\t\t\t\t(to Sachem)\n\t\t\tThe red man put down the bow, picked up \n\t\t\tthe fire stick and became the best warrior \n\t\t\tin the forest. Yes. It is the only way. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHAWKEYE\n\t\t\tWould the Huron make his Algonquin brothers \n\t\t\tfoolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell \n\t\t\tthem for gold to the white man? Would the \n\t\t\tHuron have greed for more land than a man \n\t\t\tcan use? Like Francais Black Robes do? \n\t\t\tWould Huron kill tribes with disease? Would \n\t\t\tthe Huron fool Seneca into taking all the \n\t\t\tanimals in the forest for beads & brandy? But \n\t\t\tsell the fur to the white man for gold? ... \n\t\t\t\t(to Sachem)\n\t\t\t Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les \n\t\t\tFrancais masters. Are they the ways of Huron \n\t\t\tmen who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs? \n\t\t\t... Magua's heart is twisted. He would make \n\t\t\thimself into what twisted him. A Dog, become \n\t\t\tMaster of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs? \n\t\t\t... Magua's way is false. It is like the white \n\t\t\tsickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness \n\t\t\tand shame. Is there another way? I don't know. \n\t\t\t\t(pauses)\n\t\t\tI am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, \n\t\t\tadopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican \n\t\t\tpeople ... Let the children of the dead Munro go \n\t\t\tfree ... I speak the truth. \n\n\tMagua starts to rebut. Sachem holds up his hand and stops him. Nobody talks. Sachem\n\twhispers to the older men on either side of him. \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\twaits for the decision. \n\n\tCORA\n\n\tlooks to Alice, then to Hawkeye. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\texchanges a desperate look with Cora and then senses the Sachem is staring at him\n\tfrom the perspective of nearly a century of laws & judgments.

But Hawkeye holds her tightly as they retreat. \n\n\tCORA'S POV: ALICE\n\n\twith Magua's group crosses the path. He drags Alice behind him like baggage. She\n\tregains her feet.

Behind him, others are doing something to Heyward and flames leap\n\tup. \n\n\tCORA'S EYES\n\n\tare on Alice, off to the right in the meadow. \n\n\tHAWKEYE\n\n\ttense. They're almost there. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tholding Killdeer. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK'S POV: MASSED HURON\n\n\tSky & flames. Suddenly, Heyward's stood upright into the fire, bound to a bracket by\n\this arms. As the flames start devouring him ... \n\n\tHAWKEYE & CORA\n\n\tclose to Chingachgook and the tree line ... \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\ttosses Hawkeye Killdeer. As fast as he jams it into his shoulder he FIRES. \n\n\tHEYWARD\n\n\tamong the hollering Hurons, is shot dead.

It juts away from the face six feet. \n\n\tTHE CEILING OF THE OVERHANG\n\n\tUncas' hand jams into a crack in the granite, forms a fist and twists, making a wedge.\n\tHe swings out, dangling in space by the hand wedged into the rock. His right hand\n\treaches out and up, searching the vertical face for ... \n\n\tUNCAS' HAND\n\n\t... a rock flake. An indentation. Anything ... His fingers find a diagonal crevice and ... \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tswings out, now hanging by the vertical face above the overhang. His features are\n\tdistorted with determination. Nothing will stop him. His right hand grabs another rock.\n\tHis arms snap him up. Then push. He's on the ledge. Moving fast ... \n\n\tCUT TO ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR PROMONTORY - HURONS - DAY\n\n\ton point are approaching the path above the promontory. Five warriors are ahead of\n\tMagua. One behind him drags Alice. \n\n\tFIRST\n\n\tHuron starts up the narrow path. Suddenly ... \n\n\tUNCAS\n\n\tslams him off the rock with the butt of his musket. \n\n\tWIDE ANGLE\n\n\tTwo's musket coming up. Uncas swings. FIRES. Before he's fallen, Uncas bayonets\n\tThree. \n\n\tFOURTH\n\n\tFIRES, misses, swings. Uncas slips the swung musket, but it catches his elbow. Uncas'\n\tmusket falls. Before it hits the ground his tomahawk is out and hacks Four over the\n\tedge ... \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\trunning forward past Five, confronts Uncas head on. It's incredibly fast. \n\n\tUNCAS'\n\n\tthree tomahawk swings are dodged by Magua whose own knife streaks like silver\n\tflashes. Uncas, gashed on arms and chest, feints right and slams Magua with an open\n\thand, closes and the men are intertwined steel and muscle ... and Magua throws Uncas.\n\tGoing with him and rolling off Uncas, Magua's knife flashes into his armpit. Uncas'\n\tright arm is useless. He scrambles up. Next to the expertise of a mature warrior like\n\tMagua, Uncas' raw, young determination may not be enough. \n\n\tEXTERIOR - MEADOW - CHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tfreezes. \n\n\tEXTERIOR PROMONTORY - UNCAS\n\n\tclosing, swings. Magua moves inside, stabs Uncas twice, turns him to face the edge,\n\tripping his head left to expose the right underside of his throat. \n\n\tCLOSE: MAGUA'S\n\n\tknife arm punches forward. \n\n\tWIDE: PROMONTORY\n\n\tUncas falls down the face onto to the rocks. \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tseeing his boy killed, CRIES out and is charging up the path, Hawkeye following. \n\n\tEXTERIOR PROMONTORY - ALICE\n\n\tbacks to the edge. \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\tmoves on Alice. His knife is low, about to strike. She stares at him. Her eyes are like\n\tpools of deep water, calm, open, almost beatific. It stops Magua ... \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\tinexplicably, drops his knife hand. He's riveted by her. About him, there's a glimmer of\n\tsomething else. He wears a human face for this one moment. He reaches out with his\n\tother hand to offer her safety. To bring her back from the edge ... \n\n\tALICE\n\n\tlooks down at Uncas, her lover, dead on the rocks below. She turns to Magua with\n\tenigmatic calm. Her eyes seem to see into him. She steps off the edge. She falls to her\n\tdeath next to Uncas ... \n\n\tEXTERIOR MEADOW - CORA\n\n\tcollapses to her knees on the ground and her face falls forward into her hands ... \n\n\tHURON WARRIORS\n\n\tare running down the path to intercept Chingachgook, charging uphill, fueled by a\n\tfather's rage, and Hawkeye.

Now the others fall\n\tback... It's one-on-one. Hawkeye slows ... \n\n\tCOMBATANTS\n\n\tMagua - confident, pumped up - feints with his left, his tomahawk appearing in his\n\tright, sweeping backhand, while his left, magically holding his blade, is jamming up to\n\tgut Chingachgook. Chingachgook's dead. Except ... \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tisn't there. He rolled and, on one knee with his back to Magua, his arm slams rearward.\n\tThe massive war club crashes into Magua's back. \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\tstunned, turns to hatchet Chingachgook ... \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\tnow up and towering - slams his club right into Magua's assault ... destroying it,\n\t breaking Magua's right arm. And ... \n\n\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\n\t... with his momentum, spins like a shot-putter and the next blow cripples Magua's left\n\tside and crushes part of his chest. \n\n\tANOTHER BLOW\n\n\tdestroys Magua's collar and shoulder. \n\n\tMAGUA\n\n\tamazed. His body is broken and crippled, but he still stands. He looks into the eyes of\n\tthe last warrior of the Mohicans. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tCHINGACHGOOK\n\t\t\tUNCAS!!! \n\n\tAnd he spins and swings.

A house sits isolated beside a barren\n     field. The field stretches beyond, until a line of distant\n     woods stops it. Around the back of the house stands a rundown\n     STORAGE SHED, a cold house, a privy and a water pump. A porch\n     with a single door serves as the only entrance.\n\n     Camera begins a slow move toward the house as we;\n\n     SUPER - OHIO, 1865\n\n     WE HEAR SOUNDS from inside the house - BUMPS, A CHAIR FALLING\n     OVER...and FEET RUNNING on wooden floor boards.\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     INT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAWN.\n\n     C.U. - THE HANDS OF TWO BROTHERS HOLDING EACH OTHER AS THEY\n     RUN DOWN THE STAIRS..\n\n     BULGAR (13 yrs. old) and HOWARD (14 yrs. old) run down the\n     steps from the second floor.

It is SETHE, mother of the two boys and Denver. She\n     hums her melody, softly, sadly, with a resigned understanding\n     of why her boys are running away...and a deep pain that is\n     too constant to notice.\n\n                                                          FADE OUT;\n\n     FADE IN:\n\n     INT. 124 - BABY SUGGS BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY.\n\n     BABY SUGGS, grandmother and mother-in-law to Sethe, sits in\n     her bed fondling colored fabric of BRIGHT GREEN..It is the\n     only vibrant color in an otherwise drab surrounding. Suggs is\n     bed-ridden, exhausted to her bones - her face a mosaic of\n     suffering and sacrifice and tested faith.\n\n                         BABY SUGGS\n               Ya know what I'd love to see? I loved to\n               see me some lavender. You got any\n               lavender? Or even pink - pink'll do.\n\n     Sethe is placing folded laundry into a dresser.

Next year, he\n               had him traded for lumber anyway and me\n               pregnant with his child. I couldn't love\n               that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the\n               rest either. God take what He\n               would....and He did...\n\n                         SETHE\n               The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were\n               here.\n\n                         BABY SUGGS\n               Those boys didn't even know him. You had\n               six whole years of marriage to my Halle\n               Fathered every one of your children. A\n               blessing. I learned hard that a man's\n               just a man, but a son like that...like\n               Halle..now that's somebody.\n\n     Sethe's mixed feelings show all over her face. Although she\n     loved Halle, there is clearly something unresolved in her.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Just got a few more things to do, then\n               I'll start supper.\n\n     Sethe exits.\n\n     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - LATE DAY.\n\n     Denver is playing in the front yard by herself.\n\n     Sethe is pumping water into a bucket for clothes washing. A\n     gentle breeze carries a LEAF into the bucket. Sethe sees it\n     floating atop the water for a moment, then picks it up.\n\n     C.U. of SETHE as the image triggers a feeling - and the\n     feeling a memory - from long ago.\n\n     Sethe looks around her and finds she is no longer standing in\n     the barren field of 124...but rather-\n\n     MEMORY;\n\n     EXT. SWEET HOME - LATE DAY.\n\n     A stunning vista of the plantation SWEET HOME - sun beating\n     down on groves and rows of gorgeous sycamores for as far as\n     the eye can see. Sethe's figure dwarfed by the majestic\n     landscape.\n\n     Sethe looks frightened. Her breathing grows shallow. She\n     hears something;\n\n     THE SOUND OF A WAGON'S WHEELS - rolling over a road, growing\n     louder, coming towards her\n\n                                                          INTERCUT;\n\n     C.U. OF A WAGON WHEEL MOVING RAPIDLY ON A ROAD. CAMERA PANS\n     UP TO THE MAN DRIVING THE WAGON - A STERN WHITE MAN WEARING A\n     DISTINCTIVE HAT...\n\n     SETHE TURNS away from the sycamores towards the road to see;\n\n     END OF MEMORY;\n\n     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE - LATE DAY.\n\n     A MAN driving a horse and wagon with two children in the\n     back, coming up Bluestone Road. He wears no hat.\n\n     Sethe breathes easily. She looks around her -the reality of\n     124's barren field has returned. The memory of Sweet Home's\n     sycamores have vanished.\n\n     Denver is playing near the road. As the wagon nears 124,\n     Denver looks up and smiles. The Man whips the horse hard so\n     as to ride past the house faster. The children stare at\n     Denver and 124, with horror and curiosity.\n\n     The stares of the children destroy Denver's smile. She\n     watches them go, then turns to hide her upset and sees her\n     mother watching her.\n\n     Sethe looks to Denver with empathy and impotence: wanting to\n     ease her daughter's pain and knowing full well she cannot.\n\n     Hurt and angry, Denver runs past Sethe, towards the woods.\n\n     EXT. WOODS - LATE DAY.\n\n     Denver runs with a purpose, knowing exactly where she is\n     going.\n\n     She reaches FIVE BOXWOOD BUSHES planted in a ring. The tall\n     bushes stretch toward each other four feet off the ground,\n     forming a round, emerald room in the center, seven feet high,\n     with walls fifty inches thick of murmuring leaves.\n\n     This is Denver's private place. She bends low and crawls\n     through the leaves into the center. Once there, this lonely\n     child wipes away her tears and tries to pull herself\n     together. She lays her face against the cool earth.\n\n     INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - NIGHT.\n\n     Denver walks to her room in her night dress. She passes the\n     opened door of her mother's bedroom and peeks in:\n\n     INT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.\n\n     Sethe kneeling by her bed, as if praying...\n\n     Beside Sethe, A WHITE DRESS KNEELS as well, with it's sleeve\n     around Sethe's waist. Like two friendly grown-up women,\n     comforting each other in prayer.\n\n     Denver tip toes away.\n\n     INT. DENVER'S ROOM - NIGHT.\n\n     Sethe enters to check on Denver, whom she thinks is asleep.\n     She leans over and kisses her forehead, only to discover she\n     is awake;\n\n                         DENVER\n               Mama?\n\n                         SETHE\n               What is it baby?\n\n                         DENVER\n               You think maybe when daddy comes, he\n               could talk to the baby ghost. Maybe make\n               her behave and then people won't be\n               scared of here no more.\n\n                         SETHE\n               I don't know.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Why won't she ever settle?\n\n                         SETHE\n               She's mad like a baby gets mad. You\n               forgetting how little it is. She wasn't\n               even two years old when she died. Too\n               little to understand.\n\n                         DENVER\n               For a baby she throws a powerful spell.\n\n                         SETHE\n               No more powerful than the way I loved her.\n\n     Hearing her mother say this, moves Denver.\n\n                         DENVER\n               What do you pray for Mama?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Oh, I don't really pray anymore. I just\n               talk.\n\n                         DENVER\n               About what?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Oh, about time. How some things go. Pass\n               on. Some things just stay.\n\n                         DENVER\n               What things?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Like, the place I was at before here -\n               Sweet Home. Even if that whole farm and\n               every tree and blade of grass on it died -\n               it'll still be there. Waiting. And if you\n               go and stand in the place where it was,\n               what happened there once, will happen\n               again.\n\n                         DENVER\n               If it's still there, waiting, that mean\n               nothing ever dies?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Nothing ever does. That's why I had to\n               get my children out. No matter what.\n               That's why you can never go there.\n\n                         DENVER\n               You never tell me all what happened. Just\n               that they whipped you and you run off\n               pregnant with me.\n\n                         SETHE\n               You don't need to know nothing else.\n\n                         DENVER\n                    (nods)\n               I saw a white dress kneeling next to you\n               when you was praying.\n\n                         SETHE\n               White? Maybe it was my bedding dress.\n               Describe it to me.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Had a high neck. Whole mess of buttons\n               coming down the back.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Buttons. Well, that's not my bedding\n               dress. I never had a button on nothing.\n               What else?\n\n                         DENVER\n               A bunch at the back. On the sit down\n               part.\n\n                         SETHE\n               A bustle?\n\n                         DENVER\n               I don't know what it's called.\n\n                         SETHE\n               You say it was holding on to me. How?\n\n                         DENVER\n               Kneeling next to you while you were\n               praying. I mean, talking. It looked just\n               like you.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Well, I'll be.\n\n                         DENVER\n               I think it was a sign. I think maybe\n               baby's got plans.\n\n                         SETHE\n               What plans?\n\n                         DENVER\n               I don't know, but that dress holding onto\n               you got to mean something.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Maybe. Maybe it does.\n\n     Sethe smiles sympathetically for her lonely child. They hear\n     a sound in the house - floor boards creaking.\n\n                         DENVER\n               She's crawling again.\n\n     Sethe nods and holds her daughter's hand as they listen.\n\n                                                          FADE OUT;\n\n     SUPER: 1873.\n\n                                                           FADE IN;\n\n     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY.\n\n     C.U. - PAUL D. GARNER.\n\n     Paul stands on the road, gazing up at the house. Grateful\n     he's arrived, cautious about what he'll find, he steps\n     towards the porch. His clothes are ragged. His feet sore and \n     blistering in his shoes.\n\n     EXT. THE PUMP - DAY.\n\n     Off to the side of the house, Sethe washes her feet and legs\n     at the pump. She looks up and sees Paul's figure walking\n     towards the house. The sun blazes in her eyes. She can't make\n     out who it is, or whether or not he's even real. As he\n     reaches the porch, Paul disappears from view.\n\n     Sethe walks towards the front of the house. When she is\n     little more than forty feet away, she stops - still not\n     certain Paul is a real man or an hallucination of the past.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Paul? Paul D.? Is that you?\n\n                         PAUL\n                    (smiles)\n               What's left.\n                    (He rises)\n               How you been girl, besides barefoot?\n\n     Sethe jams her balled up stockings into her pocket. She\n     smiles like a little girl, not able to believe her eyes.\n\n                         SETHE\n               You looking good.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Devil's confusion. He lets me look good\n               long as I feel bad.\n\n                         SETHE\n               How long has it been?\n\n                         PAUL\n               'Bout eighteen years, I figure.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Eighteen years.\n\n                         PAUL\n               And I swear I been walking every one of\n               them. Mind if I join you?\n\n     He begins taking off his shoes.\n\n                         SETHE\n               You want to soak them? Let me get you\n               some water.\n\n                         PAUL\n               No, uh, uh. Can't baby feet. A whole more\n               tramping they got to do yet.\n\n                         SETHE\n               You're not leaving right away, are you?\n               You stay awhile.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Well, long enough to see Baby Suggs,\n               you..Where is she?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Dead.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Aw no. When?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Eight years now. Almost nine.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Was it hard? I hope she didn't die hard.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Soft as cream. Being alive was the hard\n               part. Sorry you missed her though. Is\n               that what you came by for?\n\n                         PAUL\n               That's some of what I came for. The rest\n               is you.\n\n     Sethe doesn't know what to do with her eyes when he says\n     this..she looks away instinctively. Paul realizes that may\n     have sounded too intimate so he leans back and sighs:\n\n                         PAUL\n               The truth be known, I go anywhere these\n               days. Anywhere they let me sit down.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Come on inside.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Porch is fine. Cool out here. Sit with\n               me.\n\n     Like a nervous little girl, Sethe takes a sit beside a man\n     for the first time in years, folding her sweat stained skirt\n     beneath her.\n\n                         PAUL\n               So Baby Suggs is gone. Somehow never\n               thought death would find her.\n\n                         SETHE\n               It finds everyone.\n\n                         PAUL\n               We managed well enough without meeting\n               it.\n\n                         SETHE\n               I suppose.\n\n     Awkward pause. Sethe tries to find the words to a difficult\n     question - but one that is foremost in her mind;\n\n                         SETHE\n               I wouldn't have to ask about him, would\n               I?...You'd tell me if there was anything\n               to tell, wouldn't you?\n\n     Paul knows instantly she is asking about Halle.\n\n                         PAUL\n               You know I would. But I don't know any\n               more about what happened to Halle now\n               than I did then.\n\n     Something about Paul's expression might suggest he's keeping\n     something from her. He turns his gaze outward as he says;\n\n                         PAUL\n               You must think he's still alive.\n\n                         SETHE\n               No. I think he's dead. It's just not\n               being sure that keeps him alive.\n\n                         PAUL\n               What did Baby Suggs think?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Same. Ha, listen to her, all her children\n               dead and she felt each one go the very\n               day and hour it happened.\n\n                         PAUL\n               When she say Halle went?\n\n                         SETHE\n               1855. Same day my baby was born.\n\n                         PAUL\n               You had that baby, did you? Damn, never\n               thought you'd make it. Running off\n               pregnant.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Had to. Couldn't be no waiting.\n\n                         PAUL\n               All by yourself too.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Almost. A white girl helped me.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Then she helped herself, God bless her.\n\n     Awkward silence.\n\n                         SETHE\n               We got spare rooms. You could stay the\n               night, if you had a mind to.\n\n                         PAUL\n               You don't sound too steady in the offer.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Oh it's..it's truly meant. I just hope\n               you'll pardon my house.\n\n     Paul smiles a warm, touched smile that after all that they've \n     survived, Sethe is worried about what he'll think of her\n     home.\n\n                         PAUL\n               My house. I like the sound of that.\n\n     Sethe smiles, then rises to escort him in.\n\n     INT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY.\n\n     Sethe opens the front door and enters, with Paul behind her,\n     hanging his shoes by the laces over his shoulder. As he\n     follows her in;\n\n     A POOL OF RED, UNDULATING LIGHT forms around him. It worries\n     him.\n\n                         PAUL\n               You got company?\n\n                         SETHE\n               On and off.\n\n     The light undulates faster and faster, extending all the way\n     to the kitchen at the end of the hall. Frightened, Paul steps\n     back out the door.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Good God! What kind of evil you got in\n               there?\n\n                         SETHE\n               It's not evil..It's just..just sad. Come\n               on. Just step through.\n\n     Sethe reaches out her hand. Paul tentatively takes it and is\n     lead through the red light of the hallway, through to the\n     kitchen where it ends.\n\n     As he walks through, we can see Paul affected by the light.\n     It is sad. A sadness that touches him, welling up inside\n     until tears are brimming in his eyes. He reaches the normal\n     light of the kitchen and steps out of it.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - DAY.\n\n     Paul turns back to find the red light in the hall is gone.\n\n                         PAUL\n               I thought you said she died soft as cream.\n\n                         SETHE\n                    (busying herself in kitchen)\n               Oh that's not Baby Suggs. That's my\n               daughter. The one I sent ahead with the\n               boys before I run off.\n\n                         PAUL\n               She didn't live?\n\n                         SETHE\n               No.\n\n                         PAUL\n               The boys too?\n\n                         SETHE\n               No, they alive - they run off before Baby\n               Suggs died. The one I was carrying when I\n               left Sweet Home is all I got left.\n\n     Still affected by the light, Paul eases himself down at the\n     table, finding something to say.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Well, probably best..If a Negro boy got\n               legs he ought to use them. Sit down too\n               long, somebody figure out a way to tie\n               them up.......\n                    (the image disturbs Sethe)\n               You by yourself then?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Me and Denver... my daughter.\n\n                         PAUL\n               No man?\n                    (Sethe shakes head \"no\")\n               And that's all right by you?\n\n                         SETHE\n               It's all right by me...I cook at a\n               restaurant in town. Sew a little on the\n               sly....\n\n     She places a bottle and a glass on the table before him. The\n     light jarred him. He snatches the bottle to drink and calm\n     himself down. She jokes.\n\n                         SETHE\n               You look more done in by a walk through\n               my front hall than all those eighteen\n               years of walking put together.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Got that right.\n\n     INT. SECOND FLOOR OF 124 - MORNING.\n\n     Denver, all of eighteen years old now, and beautiful, is\n     buttoning up her dress when she hears the voice of a man down\n     in the kitchen. She stops. Her face lights up.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Daddy?\n\n     She runs down the white staircase.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING.\n\n     As Denver runs into the kitchen, we hear:\n\n                         SETHE (OS)\n               Won't you stay a little while? Can't\n               nobody catch up on eighteen years in a\n               day.\n\n     Denver appears expectantly, down the white staircase that\n     leads from the second floor. She looks at Paul wide eyed.\n     They turn to her with gentle smiles;\n\n                         SETHE\n               Baby, this here's Paul D. Garner...Paul,\n               this is my Denver...Paul's the last of\n               the Sweet Home men.\n\n     Denver's heart sinks.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Good morning Miss Denver. It's a\n               pleasure.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Good morning, Mr. D.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Garner, baby. Paul D. Garner.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Yes sir.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Glad to get a look at you. Last time I\n               saw your mama, you were pushing out the\n               front of her dress. She's a fine looking\n               young lady, Sethe. Fine looking. Got her\n               daddy's sweet face.\n\n                         DENVER\n               You knew my father?\n\n                         PAUL\n               Knew him. Knew him well.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Of course he did. I told you, he's from\n               Sweet Home. Paul may stay with us a\n               while. Won't that be nice, having an old\n               friend stay a spell?\n\n     But Denver reacts with surprise and dismay. Paul is not her\n     friend. Paul, right now, is more of an intruder.\n\n                         PAUL\n               If that's all right with you, that is?\n\n                         DENVER\n               We have a ghost here, you know.\n\n                         PAUL\n               We met. But sad, your mama said. Not\n               evil.\n\n                         DENVER\n               No sir, not evil. But not sad either.\n\n                         PAUL\n               What then?\n\n                         DENVER\n               Lonely.\n\n                         SETHE\n               I don't see how it could be lonely\n               spending every minute with us like it\n               does.\n\n                         DENVER\n               It's my sister. She was just a baby when\n               she died in this house.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Reminds me of that headless bride back\n               behind Sweet Home. Remember that Sethe?\n               Used to roam them woods regular.\n\n                         DENVER\n                    (annoyed, resentful)\n               Mama doesn't like talk about Sweet Home.\n               Says it was never sweet and it sure\n               wasn't home.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Girl, mind yourself!\n\n                         PAUL\n               Now, now, she got it right there, Sethe.\n\n                         SETHE\n               But it's where we were. All together.\n               It's where I met your father. And it\n               comes back on us whether we want it to or\n               not....\n\n                         DENVER\n               Then why don't you ever tell me about it?\n\n     Sethe pauses - unnerved and irritated by Denver's challenge.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Denver, start up the stove. Paul must be\n               hungry.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Don't go to no trouble on my account.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Bread's no trouble. The rest I brought\n               back from where I work. Least I can do,\n               cooking dawn to noon, is bring dinner\n               home. You got any objections to pike?\n\n                         PAUL\n               If he don't object to me I don't object\n               to him.\n\n     He addresses his humor to Denver who offers no response. She\n     crosses to the stove and works on lighting it. She's mad.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Where's he going to sleep? Baby Sugg's\n               room got no sheets or nothing.\n\n                         SETHE\n               We'll figure it out.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Maybe you should stay with mama, Mr.\n               Garner. Then you two can talk about Sweet\n               Home all night long.\n\n                         SETHE\n                    (explodes)\n               What's the matter with you! I never knew\n               you to behave like this!\n\n                         PAUL\n               Leave her be, Sethe. I'm a stranger to her.\n\n                         SETHE\n               That's just it. She got no cause to act\n               up with a stranger.\n\n     Denver collapses where she stands, sobbing out loud. Sethe\n     moves to her.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Baby, what is it? Did something happen?\n\n     Denver moves away. Sethe registers this rejection.\n\n                         DENVER\n               I can't no more! I can't no more!\n\n                         SETHE\n               Can't what? What can't you?\n\n                         DENVER\n               I can't live here! I don't know where to\n               go or what to do but I can't live here.\n               Nobody speaks to us. Nobody comes by.\n               Nobody even knows I'm alive.\n\n                         PAUL\n               What she talking about 'nobody speaks to\n               you'?\n\n                         SETHE\n               It's the house. People don't...\n\n                         DENVER\n               It's not! It's not the house! It's us!\n               It's you!\n                         SETHE\n               Denver!\n\n                         PAUL\n               Leave off, Sethe. It's hard for a young\n               girl living in a haunted place. That\n               can't be easy.\n\n                         SETHE\n                    (growing irritated)\n               It's easier than some other things. Come\n               here, baby..\n\n     Denver allows herself to be held.\n\n                         PAUL\n               I'm a grown man with nothing new left to\n               see or do and I'm telling you it' ain't\n               easy. Maybe you oughta move.\n\n                         SETHE\n               No!\n\n                         PAUL\n               Sethe!\n\n                         SETHE\n               No. No moving. No leaving. It's all right\n               the way it is.\n\n                         PAUL\n               You going to tell me it's all right with\n               this child half out of her mind.\n\n                         SETHE\n                    (holding Denver in her arms)\n               I got a tree on my back and a haunt in my\n               house and nothing in between but the\n               daughter I'm holding in my arms. No more\n               running - from nothing! I will never run\n               from another thing on this earth, you\n               hear! I took one journey and I paid the\n               ticket but let me tell you something,\n               Paul D. Garner; it cost too much! Do you\n               hear me?! It cost too much! Now sit down\n               and eat with us or leave us be!\n\n     Sethe's sudden outburst startles Paul. He watches as Sethe\n     ushers Denver out to the keeping room off the kitchen to\n     quiet her down.\n\n     Alone, Paul is disturbed by Sethe's words. He fishes out a\n     pouch of tobacco and concentrates on it, searching for\n     smoking papers he knows he doesn't have...waiting for Sethe\n     to return.\n\n     When she does, she heads straight for the stove. She spits on\n     her finger and touches it to check it's heat. She then begins\n     to make bread from flour, soda and salt - keeping her back to\n     Paul throughout - as the scene continues;\n\n                         PAUL\n               What tree, Sethe?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Huh?\n\n                         PAUL\n               What tree on your back? I don't see\n               nothing growing on your back.\n\n                         SETHE\n               It's there all the same.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Who told you that?\n\n                         SETHE\n               White girl. That's what she called it. I\n               never seen it and never will. But she\n               said that's what it looked like. A\n               chokecherry tree. Leaves, branches. That\n               was 18 years ago. Could have cherries by\n               now for all I know...\n\n                         PAUL\n               I don't follow.\n\n     Sethe pauses. Something in her decides to tell Paul D,\n     although she keeps working on the bread to stay in control;\n\n                         SETHE\n               I had milk, see. I was pregnant with\n               Denver but I had milk for my baby girl\n               that I sent ahead with the boys. I hadn't\n               stopped nursing her when I sent her and\n               the boys ahead of me. Anybody could smell\n               me long before they saw me. Nothing I\n               could do about it. All I knew is I had to\n               get my milk to my little girl. Nobody was\n               going to nurse her like me. Nobody was\n               going to get it to her fast enough or\n               take it away when she had enough..nobody\n               knew she couldn't pass her air if you\n               held her up on your shoulder, only if she\n               was lying on your knee..Nobody knew that\n               but me...\n\n     Paul listens, half dreading where he thinks this story's going.\n\n                         PAUL\n               We was talking about a tree, Sethe.\n\n     Sethe works faster.

Their\n               hands over my mouth and on my shoulders\n               and my legs.\n\n                                                       JUMP CUT TO:\n\n     One of the boys holds her face and mouth and head as the two\n     others hold down her body and ravage her....\n\n                         SETHE (IN KITCHEN)\n               I couldn't move. Alls I could see was the\n               loft above their heads.\n\n                                                       JUMP CUT TO:\n\n     Her mouth covered, her head immobile - she stares up at the\n     loft.\n\n     END OF MEMORY IMAGES.\n\n                         PAUL\n               The loft?\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - PRESENT DAY.\n\n     Sethe squeezes her eyes to erase the image and works harder\n     on the biscuit dough...The flashes of IMAGES STOP...\n\n                         SETHE\n               I told Mrs. Garner on them. She had that\n               lump on her neck and couldn't speak but\n               her eyes rolled out tears, I remember.\n               Them boys found out I told on 'em and\n               Schoolteacher made one open up my back,\n               and when it closed it made a tree.\n\n                         PAUL\n               They used cowhide on you?\n\n                         SETHE\n               And they took my milk.\n\n                         PAUL\n               They beat you and you was pregnant?\n\n                         SETHE\n               And they took my milk!\n\n     Sethe has separated the dough into biscuits which she slips\n     into the stove. As she rises, Paul steps gently behind her.\n     He slowly caresses her breasts from behind, pressing his\n     cheek against her back.. He rubs his cheek against it,\n     feeling the scars beneath the dress. Raising his fingers to\n     the hooks, as Sethe cries silently, he undoes her dress which\n     slips down to her hips, exposing the sculpture her back has\n     become.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Aw Lord, girl.\n\n     Grateful to have her body be someone else's responsibility\n     for the moment, Sethe closes her eyes as Paul touches every\n     ridge and leaf of her tree with his mouth. The tenderness is\n     almost unbearable.\n\n     Suddenly, PAUL'S LEGS BEGIN TREMBLING. He pauses and looks\n     down...He realizes it is not his legs that tremble, but\n     rather;\n\n     THE FLOORBOARDS THEMSELVES ARE PITCHING, GRINDING, SHOVING\n     the house from side to side.\n\n     Sethe slides to the floor, struggling with her dress.\n\n     On all fours, Denver crawls in from the keeping room as if\n     trying to keep the house together.\n\n     Paul, falling, reaching for an anchor, begins to shout;\n\n                         PAUL\n               GOD DAMN IT! HUSH UP! Leave this place\n               alone! Get the hell outta here!\n\n     A table rushes at him but Paul grabs it's leg. Managing to\n     stand at an angle as the house continues to pitch, he holds\n     the table by two legs and bashes it about, wrecking\n     everything, screaming at the house;\n\n                         PAUL\n               YOU WANT TO FIGHT, COME ON! GOD DAMN IT!\n               SHE GOT ENOUGH WITHOUT YOU! SHE GOT ENOUGH!\n\n     The quaking slows to an occasional lurch but Paul does not\n     stop whipping the table around until everything it is\n     absolutely still. He leans against the wall, panting.\n\n     Sethe is crouched by the stove. A mixed expression of relief\n     and guilt - the expression of a mother whose disobedient\n     child has been sent away. But a child she loves nonetheless.\n\n     Denver looks frightened. More alone than ever, now that her\n     one companion is gone.\n\n     All three are breathing together as if to the same beat, like\n     one tired person.\n\n                                                      LAP DISSOLVE:\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY..\n\n     Denver walks through the broken furniture and dishes. At the\n     stove, she ashes over the fire and pulls the pan of biscuits\n     from the oven,\n\n     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - CONTINUOUS.\n\n     A shirtless Paul D. is by the water pump washing himself.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS.\n\n     Denver lifts the fallen jelly cupboard, it's contents laying\n     in a heap in the corner of the bottom shelf. She takes out a\n     jar. She looks for a plate and finds half of one by the\n     broken table. She picks it up as she hears Paul enter through\n     the front door.\n\n     INT. BABY SUGGS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS.\n\n     Sethe prepares a bed for Paul. Baby Suggs quilt is on the\n     bed. She hesitates whether or not to leave it there.\n\n     Paul stands by the door with his shoes in his bands, his\n     shirt hanging open down the front.\n\n     Sethe is surprised to see him there - she feels awkward.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Why don't you...take a rest..I'll call\n               you when we're ready.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Sure you don't want me to help clean up?\n\n                         SETHE\n               No..you'd just get in my way. Denver and\n               me'll do it.\n\n     They stand in silence, looking at each other for a moment.\n     The awkwardness they both feel strike them suddenly as funny.\n     Paul starts smiling. Sethe covers her mouth to conceal it.\n\n     And then, just as quickly, the urge to laugh subsides - and\n     the fear they feel takes it's place.\n\n     Paul slowly closes the door and places his shoes on the\n     floor. Sethe watches him. Paul crosses to her. He moves in to\n     kiss her. They approach each other's lips like two burn\n     victims, trying desperately not to hurt the other with their\n     touch.\n\n     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - CONTINUOUS.\n\n     Denver sits on the porch steps, alone once again. Miserably\n     eating the biscuit and jelly off of a half broken plate.\n\n     INT. BABY SUGGS BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER.\n\n     Sethe and Paul lay in bed, after lovemaking. They are still\n     fully clothed. The lovemaking was fast and finished quickly.\n     Now, there is an awkwardness that is without humor or\n     excitement - but sits like a chasm between them.\n\n     As Sethe lays there, SHE REMEMBERS:\n\n     MEMORY:\n\n     EXT. THE CORN FIELDS OF SWEET HOME - A DAY REMEMBERED.\n\n     A brilliant bright yellow and green corn stalks in a tiny\n     corn field.\n\n     Sethe and a slightly older HALLE - handsome, strong - run\n     through the field until Halle stops them at an isolated spot.\n\n                         HALLE\n               How's this?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Here?! out in the open?!\n\n                         HALLE\n               Look around - can you see anybody?\n\n     Sethe looks and can see nothing through the corn stalks. She\n     shakes her head no.\n\n                         HALLE\n               Then nothing can see us neither.\n\n     He takes off his shirt. Seethe giggles as she gets on the\n     ground, keeping her ankles crossed.\n\n     Halle lays her back and gently separates her legs. She\n     giggles. Halle pauses before laying on top of her.\n\n                         HALLE\n               You are a beautiful sight.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Don't talk stupid.\n\n                         HALLE\n               You're my wife now! I can talk as stupid\n               as I like about you!\n                    (she giggles)\n               I ain't never loved nothing like you\n               before, Sethe.\n                    (Sethe is moved)\n               And after I get mama out...then I get us\n               out too. And you'll see, baby girl...\n                    (smiles)\n               we're gonna have us a liiife..\n\n     He sings the word \"life\", so that Sethe laughs. Then, Halle\n     lowers himself slowly to her and they begin to make love. As\n     camera pans up to a HILL above the field, we hear Sethe ask;\n\n                         SETHE (O.S.)\n               You sure nobody can see?\n\n     We hear Halle grunt \"uh-huh\" as we arrive on the hill where a\n     GREAT TREE sits.\n\n     EXT. GREAT TREE ON THE HILL - DAY.\n\n     Beneath the tree, PAUL D, SIXO and Paul's brothers Paul A.\n     and Paul P. are pouring water over heads and watching;\n\n     POV; Unbeknownst to Halle and Sethe, their lovemaking is in\n     clear view to anyone on the hill...\n\n                         PAUL A\n               Damn. I don't get why she picked him.\n\n                         PAUL D\n               Halle's got that way about him. That way\n               a woman feels he's doing it all for her,\n               not for himself at all.\n\n                         PAUL A\n               I can't see nothing so special about Halle.\n\n                         PAUL F\n               What about what he's doing for his mama?\n\n                         PAUL A\n               Fool thing, if you ask me. By the time he\n               buys it, freedom won't mean a thing to\n               somebody that old and worn.\n\n                         SIXO\n               Freedom mean something anytime it come.\n\n     The men watch the corn stalks swaying to the lovemaking.\n\n     A YOUNG PAUL D., in particular, watches with tender yearning.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN AT SWEET HOME - EARLY EVENING.\n\n     MR. GARNER, the man who owns and runs Sweet Home. He offers\n     cooked corn to the men.\n\n                         MR. GARNER\n               Raccoon must've got into my corn. Damaged\n               a few so, no use throwing them out...\n\n     The men looks to each other, suppressing a laugh.\n\n                         MR. GARNER\n               Sethe, get the butter there.\n\n     Everyone looks at each other as they thank No. Garner and\n     begin to smear butter on their corn and eat.\n\n     A NEIGHBORING FARMER visiting the Garner's cautions him;\n\n                         NEIGHBORING FARMER\n               You spoil these nigger boys.\n\n                         GARNER\n               Maybe you got boys on your farm. My\n               nigger's are men. Not a boy among'em.\n               Bought 'em thataway, raised'em thataway.\n\n                         NEIGHBORING FARMER\n               Beg to differ Garner. Ain't no nigger men.\n\n                         GARNER\n               Not if you scared. But if you a man\n               yourself, you'll want your niggers to be\n               men too.\n\n                         NEIGHBORING FARMER\n               Wouldn't have no nigger men around my\n               wife.\n\n                         GARNER\n               Neither would I..Neither would I.\n\n     Sethe hides a smile as she hands a piece of corn to Halle.\n     Paul A and Paul F hesitate as they think of eating the corn\n     which the lovers consummated. But Sixo digs right in.\n\n     Paul D eats slowly, his eyes never leaving Sethe as she moves\n     Around the kitchen, her eyes never leaving Halle...Paul's\n     Attraction and love for her are apparent.\n\n     END OF MEMORY;\n\n     INT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING.\n\n     C.U. on PAUL, on his back, turned away from Sethe.\n\n     What began as Sethe's memory, has blended into Paul's.\n\n     Sethe rises off the bed, breaking the thick silence between them:\n\n                         SETHE\n               I'll call you when there's something to\n               eat.\n\n     She exits, leaving Paul alone on the bed.\n\n     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - THE FOLLOWING DAY.\n\n     We see the house now. No creaking or sounds of breaking\n     furniture. Just the sound of Paul D. singing.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - DAY.\n\n     Paul is singing as he fixes the table he broke while driving\n     the baby ghost away.\n\n     Denver is sweeping the floor - irritated by Paul's presence\n     and voice.\n\n     They both hear the front door open as Sethe arrives home from\n     work.\n\n     They look to each other to see which one will make a move for\n     Sethe first. Paul knows enough to bide his time with Denver.\n     He watches as she places the broom down and exits the\n     kitchen.\n\n     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - NIGHT.\n\n     Paul and Sethe sit on the porch together. Sethe is sewing.\n     Paul nervously gets up his nerve to ask:\n\n                         PAUL\n               Sethe.\n                    (she stops and looks)\n               I was thinking of looking for work around\n               here. What do you think?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Ain't much. River mostly. And hogs.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Hogs is fine.\n\n     Paul moves to where Sethe is sitting.\n\n                         PAUL\n               I don't need much, Sethe. Eat, sleep,\n               sing a little when it strikes me. I don't\n               ask for more to..to live somewhere.\n\n     Sethe realizes what he is asking and tentatively responds:\n\n                         SETHE\n               All right. It's...it's fine with me.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Your girl Denver. Seems she's of a\n               different mind.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Don't worry about her. She's a charmed\n               child. Nothing ever touch her too bad.\n               From the beginning. Everybody I knew dead\n               or gone, but not her.\n                    (pause)\n               You got to know something, though - this\n               here ain't no better life. It's just not\n               that other one. What I do here - all I\n               ever do - is keep Denver from that\n               other..So if you stay, there's no more\n               talk about Sweet Home or anything else. I\n               won't let the past in my yard again.\n               Getting me and Denver through this here\n               life is all that matters. You understand?\n\n                         PAUL\n               Dangerous to love anything that much,\n               Sethe. Best thing is to love everything\n               just a little bit..that way, when it\n               breaks or runs off or gets taken, well\n               maybe you'd have a little love left over\n               for the next one.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Don't be asking me to choose, Paul D.\n               There ain't no choice here.\n\n                         PAUL\n               That's the whole point. I'm not asking\n               you to choose. Just want to know if\n               there's some space for me. Want to know\n               if it's more than \"you can stay\", \"it's\n               fine\"..more like, \"I want you here Paul\".\n\n     Beat. Sethe is frightened by the prospect of feeling for him.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Maybe we should leave things the way they\n               are.\n\n     Sethe rises to enter the house when Paul's words stop her:\n\n                         PAUL\n               How are they?\n\n                         SETHE\n               We get along.\n\n                         PAUL\n               What about inside?\n\n                         SETHE\n               I don't go inside.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Sethe, if I'm here with you, with Denver,\n               you can go anywhere you want. Jump, if\n               you want to, 'cause I'll catch you. Go as\n               far inside as you need - I'll hold your\n               ankles. Make sure you get back out. I'm\n               not saying this because I need a place to\n               stay. I told you, I'm a walking man, but\n               I been heading in this direction for\n               seven years. When I got here and sat out\n               there on the porch, waiting for you,\n               well, I knew it wasn't the place I was\n               heading toward. It was you. We can make a\n               life girl. A life.\n\n                         SETHE\n                    (scared)\n               I don't know. I don't know.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Leave it to me. See how it goes. No\n               promises, if you don't want to make any.\n               Just see how it goes, all right?\n\n     Sethe's heart is twisted. She wants to cry...because she\n     feels hope...and because she feels fear.\n\n                         SETHE\n               All right. We'll see how it goes.\n\n                         PAUL\n               You willing to leave it to me?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Well..some of it.\n\n                         PAUL\n                    (smiles)\n               Some?...Well okay...some.\n\n     Sethe manages a smile.\n\n     INT. DENVER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.\n\n     Denver lies curled up in her bed. Alone.\n\n     Sethe enters and crawls in unexpectedly. Denver looks up,\n     surprised to see her.\n\n                         DENVER\n               What is it? What's wrong?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Nothing. Nothing's wrong. Lay back down.\n\n     Denver obeys, unsure.\n\n                         DENVER\n               You think baby ghost's really gone?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Don't know.\n\n                         DENVER\n               I miss her.\n\n     Sethe lets out a small laugh.\n\n                         DENVER\n               I do. Baby Suggs told me baby ghost would\n               never hurt me. She was my sister. When I\n               was little, after the boys left, I used\n               to think that she and me both were\n               waiting for daddy to come. And once he\n               did, she wouldn't be mad no more.\n                    (Sethe listens sadly)\n\n     They hear Paul singing out on the porch. Denver grimaces.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Wish he'd shut-up...He's ruined\n               everything.\n\n                         SETHE\n               No, he hasn't. He won't.\n                    (hesitates)\n               He..he wants to takes us to the\n               carnival next Thursday...\n\n     Denver's eyes light up with excitement then caution.\n\n                         DENVER\n               You mean, go out where they'll be other\n               people?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Dress up a little bit. Wear our hats.\n               What do you think?\n\n                         DENVER\n                    (downplaying her excitement)\n               Maybe....\n\n                         SETHE\n               Maybe...All right...all right.\n                    (difficult for her to say)\n               Can I ask you something?\n                    (Denver nods, her back to\n                    Sethe)\n               I was wondrin'..What you think about\n               us...maybe... maybe thinking we could\n               start...if we got an idea to, thinking we\n               could start.. countin' on...\n                    (she stops)\n\n                         DENVER\n               On what mama? Countin' on what?\n\n     Sethe can barely bring herself to say. To hope. To imagine.\n     Paul? But, for Denver, she forces herself and whispers;\n                         SETHE\n               Something.\n\n     EXT. CARNIVAL - DAY.\n\n     Paul and Sethe and Denver walk among the hundreds of black\n     townspeople gathered for the carnival.\n\n     A sign reads COLORED THURSDAY...TWO PENNIES ENTRANCE FEE.\n\n     Paul is in high spirits. Saying hello to anyone whose eye he\n     catches. Willing, eager to get anything for Denver she wants.\n     Feeling a little more like a normal van in a normal life.\n\n     Denver is excited but worried. She doesn't want to like Paul\n     but can't help the thrill she's feeling. And when one or two\n     passersby shout out;\n\n                         VARIOUS PASSERS-\n                         BY\n               Hey Denver!...Hi there Denver!\n\n     Denver heart almost weeps with joy.\n\n     Sethe walks cautiously. Overdressed for the occasion, it is\n     her first outing among neighborhood folk in many years.\n\n     She catches the eyes of some of the women she knows...ELLA\n     and LADY JONES..good Christian women who nod in their\n     acknowledgement yet are holding back something. A judgement?\n     A repulsion?\n\n     Paul doesn't notice them and for this Sethe is glad.\n\n     MONTAGE of SCENES...the various carnival acts, all performed\n     by a WHITE TROUPE; magic, clowning, fire swallowing, spitting\n     ribbons, acrobats forming pyramids...\n\n     Our trio take it all in like water to the thirsty.\n\n     At one point, A WHITE CARNIVAL BARKER shouts to the children;\n\n                         CARNIVAL BARKER\n               All Pickaninnies free!!\n\n     The phrase stabs Sethe and Paul a bit. But Paul whispers;\n\n                         PAUL\n               Two pennies and an insult well spent in\n               my opinion to see the spectacle of\n               whitefolks making a spectacle of\n               themselves.\n\n     Sethe can't help but let out a small laugh - and with that\n     laugh, a sudden sensation of relief...\n\n     Paul buys Denver some licorice, peppermint and lemonade.\n     Holding the lemonade for her, Paul asks;\n\n                         PAUL\n               Mind if I take a sip?\n\n     Denver agrees. Paul takes some lemonade then wipes the rim\n     where he sipped with a small napkin and gently hands it back\n     to her. Denver, in spite of herself, is starting to like him.\n\n     END MONTAGE.\n\n     EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY.\n\n     Our trio are leaving the carnival, walking three astride with\n     distance in between each. The sunlight casts strong shadows.\n\n     Sethe's eyes glance towards the ground behind them and sees;\n\n     THEIR THREE SHADOWS ARE HOLDING HANDS.....as they walk home.\n\n                                                          FADE OUT;\n\n     FADE- IN.\n\n     EXT. A STREAM AND THE BANK BESIDE IT - DAY.\n\n     WIDE ANGLE of a BEAUTIFUL, WIDE STREAM (more like a small\n     river) with a MULBERRY TREE standing tall on the bank before\n     it. There is not a soul in sight as the stream moves\n     gracefully beneath the sun.\n\n     SUDDENLY;\n\n     A FULLY DRESSED YOUNG BLACK WOMAN EMERGES FROM THE MIDDLE OF\n     THE STREAM LIKE A GODDESS ARISING OUT OF SPIRITUAL WATERS...\n     SHE WEARS A STRAW HATT A WHITE DRESS WITH BUTTONS, A LACE\n     COLLAR AND NEW SHOES. SHE WALKS OUT OF THE WATER TO THE BANK.\n\n     Exhausted, sopping wet and breathing heavily as if from\n     asthma, she sits, leaning against the mulberry tree. She\n     seems too tired to even hold her head upon her neck. Yet her\n     skin is like new lineless and smooth. Glowing.\n\n     Although racked with pain, SHE IS SMILING. Smiling the way\n     travellers smile when they have finally arrived after a long\n     and arduous journey.\n\n     EXT. WOODS - DAY.\n\n     The Young Black Woman makes her way through the woods. She\n     passes by Denver's BOXWOOD BUSH secret place. Then continues\n     forward, as if with a specific direction in mind.\n\n     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON.\n\n     Sethe, Paul and Denver approach 124. Denver is the first to\n     see.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Look. What is that?\n\n     All three look to see;\n\n     THE YOUNG BLACK WOMAN sitting on a stump not far from the\n     steps of 124.\n\n     As the three approach, the Young Woman lifts her head and\n     stares directly at Sethe.\n\n     The two women exchange a moment in their eyes - Sethe,\n     curious yet warm...The Young Woman, happy yet there is a\n     hunger in her stare.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER.\n\n     The Young Woman seated on a chair as Denver refills a tin cup\n     of water. The Young Woman drinks greedily, cup after cup.\n\n                         SETHE\n               You from around here?\n\n     The Young Woman shakes her head NO. She reaches down and\n     takes off her shoes, which Sethe notices as new. Sethe bends\n     down to pick them up. The Young Woman never lets her eyes\n     leave Sethe.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Those shoes look brand new.\n\n                         SETHE\n               What might your name be?\n\n     The Young Woman speaks in a low, rough voice;\n\n                         BELOVED\n               Beloved.\n\n     Sethe drops the shoes. Denver sits down. Paul smiles;\n\n                         PAUL\n               Beloved. You use a last name, Beloved?\n\n                         BELOVED\n               Last. No..just Beloved..\n                    (she spells it)\n               B..E..L..O..V..E..D...\n\n     As she spells it we see sethe's reaction; she is deeply\n     touched. Then Denver's - who looks both amazed and curiously\n     excited.\n\n     Sethe hangs her own hat on a peg then approaches Beloved.\n\n                         SETHE\n               That's a pretty name Beloved. Take off\n               your hat and I'll make us something. We\n               just got back from the carnival over near\n               Cincinnati-\n\n     But Beloved has fallen asleep upright in the chair.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Miss...Miss, you want to lay down?\n\n     Her eyes open to slits. Paul is about to help her when Denver\n     rises;\n\n                         DENVER\n               I'll take her up. She can sleep in baby\n               Suggs room - that all right Mama?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Course.\n\n     Denver eases Beloved onto her feet, which Sethe and Paul\n     notice do not have a line or sore on them.\n\n                         PAUL\n                    (whispers to Sethe)\n               Look at her feet? They're not walking\n               feet. More like she rode from somewhere\n               all the way here.\n\n     Yet, Beloved can barely stand upon them as Denver escorts her\n     to the white staircase. Beloved starts coughing.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Sounds like the croup.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Is she feverish, Denver?\n\n                         DENVER\n               No. She's cold.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Then she is. Fever goes from hot to cold.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Could have the cholera.\n\n                         DENVER\n                    (adamant)\n               She's not sick!\n\n     Denver helps her up the stairs. Sethe and Paul register\n     Denver's defensive reaction.\n\n     INT. BABY SUGG'S ROOM - SAME TIME.\n\n     Denver eases Beloved into the bed. Beloved falls asleep the\n     second she hits the pillow. Denver gently - cautiously -\n     strokes Beloved's forehead and cheek.\n\n     INT. BABY SUGG'S ROOM - NIGHT.\n\n     Denver stands vigil beside Beloved, wrapped beneath a quilt.\n\n     INT. BABY SUGG'S ROOM - THE FOLLOWING DAY.\n\n     Denver watches her sleep, wiping her hot forehead with cold\n     cloths...\n\n     INT. BABY'S SUGG'S ROOM - NIGHT.\n\n     Denver washes out Beloved's underwear and stockings...She\n     hears Beloved murmuring. She moves quickly to her side.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Beloved? Beloved I'm here...what is it?\n\n                         BELOVED\n               Heavy..this place is heavy.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Would you like to sit up?\n\n     Beloved shakes her head no. She takes hold of Denver's arm\n     and wraps it around her own body. Denver sits up against the\n     pillow as Beloved snuggles her body into Denver's arms and\n     falls back asleep. Denver holds her, lovingly.\n\n     INT. BABY SUGGS ROOM - DAYS LATER.\n\n     Denver has not left her bedside. She places another quilt\n     upon her, tucking it in around the sides. As she does this,\n     Beloved's eyes open for a brief moment, catching the sight of\n     Denver over her. She smiles. Denver gratefully smiles back.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Can I get you anything? Are you hungry?\n\n     Beloved looks over to a plate of half finished food -\n     Denver's meal. Denver picks up a piece of sweet bread and\n     feeds her. Denver is thrilled.\n\n     THE FOLLOWING SCENES TAKE PLACE OVER SEVERAL WEEKS;\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - THE NEXT DAY.\n\n     Denver places sugar between two pieces of bread and gives the\n     sandwich to Beloved, who, no longer feeling sickly, accepts\n     it with a bright smile.\n\n     EXT. HEN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY.\n\n     Denver explains how to pack mud in the cracks of the hen\n     house as Beloved listens attentively, eating jelly out of a\n     jar.\n\n     INT. HEN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY.\n\n     Denver explains to Beloved how to warm the chicks with their\n     skirts as the latter eats something sweet. They both giggle\n     at the softness of the chicks.\n\n     INT. DENVER & BELOVED'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER DAY.\n\n     Denver is showing Beloved how to make her bed.\n\n                         DENVER\n               ..then you fold it over like this see.\n               This here used to be where my brothers\n               and me slept. I was always at the top.\n\n                         BELOVED\n               How you get so smart?\n\n                         DENVER\n               I ain't so smart.\n\n                         BELOVED\n               Yes you are!\n\n                         DENVER\n               Well, I used to go to Lady Jones. She'd\n               teach us with songs how to spell and\n               count.\n\n                         BELOVED\n               You don't go no more?\n\n                         DENVER\n               No I...I had to stop going.\n\n                         BELOVED\n               You so smart. Tell me about your\n               brothers.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Well..they're names were Howard and..\n\n     As Denver continues, Beloved steps towards her and begins to\n     touch her face - examining her lips, her nose, her skin as if\n     it were a rose to admire. Denver drinks in the attention, her\n     heart expanding with love with every touch from this strange\n     creature.\n\n                         DENVER\n               ..and....and Bulgar...At night, we used\n               to..crawl into bed together..I'd lay down\n               on Bul's lap and Howard would tell us die-\n               witch stories. He said they would protect\n               us...And if I learned them, they would\n               protect me if ever they were gone...\n\n     EXT. PORCH - EARLY EVENING.\n\n     Everyone is sitting on the porch after dinner.\n\n     Beloved, looking strong and fit, eats a cane stick - gnawing\n     at it to the flax, keeping the strings in her mouth long\n     after the syrup had been sucked off. It makes Denver laugh,\n     as she licks her cane stick. It makes Sethe smile, to see\n     them both happy.\n\n     It makes Paul disgusted.\n\n     INT. KEEPING ROOM - NIGHT.\n\n     Paul confronts Sethe as she sews.\n\n                         PAUL\n               You gonna just feed her, from now on?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Denver likes her. She's no real trouble.\n\n                         PAUL\n               But don't she have a home? Some place to\n               go?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Didn't mention one. I thought we'd wait\n               until her breathing got better. She still\n               sounds a little lumbar.\n\n                         PAUL\n               She breathe like she can eat, she could\n               blow this whole house down. And all those\n               sweets.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Sometimes the body needs that sugar for\n               strength when it's trying to recover\n               after an illness.\n\n                         PAUL\n               But that's just it. She don't seem sick.\n               Something funny about her.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Funny? How?\n\n                         PAUL\n               Acts sick, sounds sick but she don't look\n               sick. Good skin, bright hands and strong\n               as a bull.\n\n                         SETHE\n               She can hardly walk without holding onto\n               something.\n\n                         PAUL\n               That's what I mean. Can't walk but I\n               passed by Baby Sugg's room this morning\n               and saw her lifting the rocker with one\n               hand.\n\n                         SETHE\n               You didn't?\n\n                         PAUL\n               Don't tell me. Ask Denver. She was right\n               there.\n\n     At that moment, Denver passes by on her way to the kitchen.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Denver. Come in here a minute.\n\n     Denver enters the keeping room.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Paul says you saw Beloved pick up the\n               rocking chair in Baby Suggs room with one\n               hand. That so?\n\n     Denver looks at Paul with a hard gaze;\n\n                         DENVER\n               I didn't see no such thing.\n\n     From Paul's expression we can tell Denver is lying...and\n     whatever fragile connection they were building, is swiftly\n     destroyed.\n\n     INT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.\n\n     Sethe is getting ready for bed. Denver sticks her head in:\n\n                         DENVER\n               Have you seen her? I can't find her.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Who?\n\n                         DENVER\n               Beloved.\n\n     Sethe shakes her head. Denver exits anxiously. The mentions\n     of Beloved's name stir a MEMORY in Sethe:\n\n     MEMORY:\n\n     EXT. GRAVESTONE YARD - A DAY REMEMBERED.\n\n     Sethe talks to the HEADSTONE ENGRAVER as he works in the hot\n     sun. His YOUNG SON helps him.\n\n                         SETHE\n               She need a marker. Somethin' to tell me\n               where she is. But I ain't got no money.\n\n     The Engraver eyes her body.\n\n                         ENGRAVER\n               What you got then?\n\n     Sethe is embarrassed by his lascivious tone, especially in\n     front of the young boy.\n\n     The Engraver rises, takes a step toward Sethe and touches her\n     hip, curling his hand around to her back.\n\n                         ENGRAVER\n               What you want it to say?\n\n                         SETHE\n               I was thinking what the preacher say at\n               the funeral. Dearly Beloved.\n\n                         ENGRAVER\n                    (touching her)\n               For ten minutes I give you one word for\n               free.\n\n     His hand glides down to her buttocks. Sethe can't help but\n     see the Young Boy watching the scene.\n\n     END of MEMORY.\n\n     INT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.\n\n     As the memory starts to fade form her mind, Sethe suddenly\n     feels someone else's presence. She looks up to find:\n\n     Beloved standing by the door - watching her.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Oh!...I didn't know you were there.\n\n                         BELOVED\n               Can I help?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Help what, honey?\n\n     Beloved kneels before her on the floor and finishes buttoning\n     up Sethe's night dress.\n\n                         BELOVED\n               Where you go in the morning?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Work. I work in a restaurant.\n\n                         BELOVED\n               What time you go?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Little after the sun come up. I like to\n               make a loaf of bread before I go. How you\n               feelin'?\n\n     Beloved nods, absorbing the information.\n\n                         SETHE\n               You remember your mother at all?\n\n                         BELOVED\n                    (scratching back of her head)\n               I remember a woman who was mine and I\n               remember bein snatched away from her.\n\n     Sethe, nods, understanding such things. She cautiously\n     reaches out to stroke Beloved's face. Beloved responds like a\n     puppy, pressing her cheek against Sethe's hand. Sethe is\n     moved.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - PRE DAWN.\n\n     Sethe enters the kitchen to make bread before she leaves for\n     work. She finds Beloved waiting for her, placing out her\n     cooking things on the table. Beloved looks up and smiles.\n\n                         BELOVED\n               I'm helpin make your bread.\n\n     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE - EARLY EVENING.\n\n     Beloved waits anxiously at the window for the sight of Sethe\n     coming home from work....\n\n     When she sees her, she runs through the house, out the door\n     to meet her.\n\n     Denver appears at the door, upset by Beloved's loss of\n     attention in her.\n\n     EXT. PORCH - EVENING.\n\n     C.U. - SETHE, as she leans her tired head against the porch,\n     sitting on the step. She closes her eyes and is about to\n     drift off, when;\n\n     BELOVED'S HAND gently touches her shoulder, settling there.\n\n     Sethe looks up and smiles, patting her hand. Beloved stands\n     above her as Denver takes a seat on the step.\n\n     Beloved searches Sethe's eyes and asks;\n\n                         BELOVED\n               Where your diamonds?\n\n     The question surprises Sethe...and startles Denver.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Diamonds? What would I be doing with diamonds?\n\n                         BELOVED\n               On your ears.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Wish I did.\n                    (beat)\n               Hmm..come to think of it, I had some\n               crystal once. A present from Mrs. Garner -\n               woman I worked for at Sweet Home.\n\n                         DENVER\n               I never saw you with no earrings.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Gone. Long gone.\n\n                         BELOVED\n               Tell me...Tell me about your diamonds...\n\n     Sethe hesitates. Beloved kneels at her feet.\n\n                         DENVER\n                    (to Beloved)\n               Ma'am don't talk about Sweet Home.\n\n                         BELOVED\n                    (ignoring her)\n               Tell me...Tell me about your diamonds.\n\n     Denver awaits her mother's reaction with great interest.\n     Sethe looks at Beloved sweet, innocent expression and\n     something in her resistance, eases:\n\n                         SETHE\n               Well..this lady I worked for in Kentucky\n               gave them to me when I got married..\n\n     Denver is both interested and slightly hurt at her mother's \n     willingness to tell Beloved what she'd never tell her:\n\n                         SETHE\n               ..What they called married back then. I\n               remember going up to her in the kitchen\n               to tell her. I'd help her make ink for\n               Mr. Garner in the kitchen. I was fool\n               enough to think I was going have some\n               kind of ceremony...maybe even a new\n               dress..\n                    (CONTINUES AS WE CUT TO;)\n\n     Sethe's continues telling Beloved, an attentive audience...\n\n     Denver, more attuned to Beloved's interest than the story, is \n     disturbed at her mother's telling of it.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - ANOTHER EVENING.\n\n     Camera moves up from the mended legs of the table Paul broke\n     to;\n\n     A suspicious Paul glares at Beloved as they eat dinner.\n\n     Beloved is ever ready to pass Sethe a bowl or napkin or\n     whatever she needs. She is \"shining\" - for Sethe, and for\n     Sethe alone.\n\n     Denver notices it as well.\n\n     It is raining outside. Both Denver and Beloved are wet from\n     the rain. Denver's hair is all tangled.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Best unbraid that hair.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Tomorrow.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Today's always here. Tomorrow never.\n\n                         DENVER\n               It hurts.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Comb it everyday, it won't..\n\n                         BELOVED\n               Your woman never fixed up your hair?\n\n     All three look to Beloved, puzzled by her question, which is\n     clearly intended for Sethe. Paul's getting more annoyed.\n\n                         PAUL\n               What?\n\n                         SETHE\n               My woman?..You mean my mother?\n\n     Beloved nods. Paul and Denver exchange a curious look.\n\n                         SETHE\n               If she did I don't remember. I don't\n               think I saw her but a few times.\n\n                         BELOVED\n               Tell me 'bout her.\n\n     Paul and Denver look to Sethe, waiting to see if she'll answer.\n\n                         SETHE\n               ..I remember once, she picked me up and\n               carried me behind the smokehouse... The\n               only thing I do remember in fact...\n\n     Paul is disturbed by Sethe's carefree storytelling - how it \n     contradicts her words to him that first day and worried it\n     will lead to no good...\n\n     Once again, Denver is surprised to hear what she's never\n     heard before. She looks to Paul and knows what he is\n     thinking. Paul looks back and knows Denver realizes it. But\n     Denver returns his glance with a defensive dismissal of the\n     eyes.\n\n                         SETHE\n               ...She opened up her dress and right on\n               her rib, right here, was a circle and a\n               cross burnt right into the skin....\n\n                         PAUL\n                    (interrupts her)\n               Sethe.\n\n                         SETHE\n               What?\n\n     Paul doesn't want her to continue but doesn't want to say so.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Any more beans?\n\n     Sethe rises to get him more food and she continues:\n\n                         SETHE\n               ...anyway, she points to this mark and\n               says to me \"This is your ma'am.

I didn't\n               understand it then. Not until I had a\n               mark of my own...\n\n     Paul is disturbed. He can see Sethe getting upset. He is mad\n     at Beloved for her damn questions..\n\n                         BELOVED\n               What happened to her?\n\n     Something inside of Sethe stops, a wall erected. Something\n     unwanted is coming into her consciousness. Paul notices it.\n     She rises;\n\n                         SETHE\n               Don't know. Everybody done?\n\n     Sethe collects a few dishes and crosses to the sink as Paul asks:\n\n                         PAUL\n               Well, as long as we're all asking\n               questions, getting to know each other..\n                    (to Beloved)\n               Why don't you tell us a little bit about\n               yourself?\n\n     Camera follows Sethe as she arrives at the sink, placing the\n     dish inside. We hear the others O.S.:\n\n                         DENVER (O.S.)\n                    (defensively)\n               She don't remember nothing.\n\n                         PAUL (O.S.)\n               You be surprised what you start\n               remembering once you start talking.\n\n                         BELOVED (O.S.)\n               Can I have some more pudding?\n\n     Camera stays on Sethe as we drown out the voices at the\n     kitchen table. She is staring out the window above the sink\n     as if watching the MEMORY BEING RELIVED IN HER YARD;\n\n     POV - OUT THE WINDOW;\n\n     MEMORY:\n\n     EXT. A LARGE TREE IN A FIELD - A DAY REMEMBERED.\n\n     A CROWD of people surround a tree. SEVERAL WHITE MEN are\n     preparing to hang a group of black men and women standing in\n     line, awaiting their turn.\n\n     Among the crowd is A CHILD (SETHE) holding the hand of an\n     OLDER BLACK SLAVE WOMAN (NAN). Nan is pointing to a WOMAN\n     (SETHE'S MOTHER), who is one of the people waiting in line to\n     be hanged. Nan whispers to Sethe:\n\n                         NAN\n               That's your mama - right there.\n\n     Little Sethe looks up and sees her mother - her face a mask\n     of courage and rage and tears. She looks straight ahead - not\n     at anyone in particular, especially not her daughter.\n\n                         NAN\n               ..I'm telling you, small girl Sethe...Me\n               and your Mama was taken by the men many\n               times..She threw them other babies\n               away..the others from the whites, without\n               names, she threw them away..But you she\n               gave the name of the black man. She had\n               her arms around him, child. The others,\n               she did not put her arms around.\n               Never...Never...\n\n     The child Sethe listens, watching her mother move further\n     down the line.\n\n     END of MEMORY as WE CUT BACK TO:\n\n     INT. KITCHEN -\n\n     Sethe, the memory passing, hears the voices in her kitchen:\n\n                         PAUL (O.S.)\n               Ain't you got no brothers or sisters?\n\n                         BELOVED (O.S.)\n               I don't have nobody.\n\n     She finds Paul interrogating Beloved who eats a second\n     pudding.

When I was at the bridge,\n               she told me.\n\n     Paul looks quizzically at Sethe, who shrugs;\n\n                         SETHE\n               Must be somebody from the old days.\n\n                         PAUL\n               How'd you come? Who brought you?\n\n                         BELOVED\n               I walked here. A long, long, long, long\n               way. Nobody bring me.\n\n                         PAUL\n               You had new shoes.

I...\n\n     Suddenly, she begins to CHOKE on a raisin from the pudding\n     and falls backward, off the chair.\n\n     Denver and Sethe rush towards her. Beloved thrashes around\n     until they help her turn over and spit up the raisin.\n\n     She breathes in Sethe's arms as Denver wipes up the mess,\n     glaring at Paul.\n\n                         SETHE\n               You all right?\n\n                         BELOVED\n                    (whispers)\n               I want to go to sleep now.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Come to my room.

It's\n               clear why she holds onto you, but I just\n               can't see why you holding on to her.\n\n                         SETHE\n               What you care who's holding on to who?\n               Feeding her is no trouble.

I never knew\n               what messed Halle up. That was it, I\n               guess. I seen him the day after you left.\n               Says where you been Halle? All he says to\n               me was \"the loft\". I asked him what he\n               meant not going with you but he never\n               answers me.

SWEET HOME - DAY.\n\n     PAUL HAS A BIT IN HIS MOUTH CHAINED TO A WAGON.\n\n     He is being lead away from Sweet Home with other black men,\n     by Three white Men. The bit jerks his head back, saliva\n     spills uncontrollably out of his mouth. His hands are chained\n     behind him. His feet chained together at the\n     ankles....Another chain is connected to an iron belt and\n     stretches to a wagon. He is being lead away with forty five\n     other prisoners...\n\n                         PAUL (VO)\n               I tried to kill Brandywine - man\n               Schoolteacher sold me to. Don't know what\n               possessed me...Me and about 45 other\n               prisoners were being walked from Kentucky\n               to Virginia...then on to Georgia. Two\n               places I don't ever want to see again.\n\n     He is lead past the milk shed, when he sees:\n\n     HALLE, alone with a crazed faraway look in his eyes, sitting\n     by the butter churn. HALLE'S FACE IS COVERED WITH BUTTER AND\n     CLABBER. He sticks his hands in the churn and continues to\n     cover his face with the sticky, slippery, white substance\n     covering his face and head, squeezing it through his hands.\n\n     The White Men laugh. Paul is aching to scream out to him but\n     the iron bit holds down his tongue.\n\n     As Paul is lead past Halle, A ROOSTER named MISTER is SITTING\n     ON A TUB in the sun shrieks with an almost arrogant glee.\n\n                         WHITE MAN\n               Look at Mister there...\n                    (referring to the rooster)\n               You go tell these niggers where to go\n               there Mister! Crow'em right outta here!\n\n     Mister crows and the white men laugh.\n\n     Tears of rage and humiliation stream down Paul's face. He\n     struggles to keep a view of Halle, until he is out of sight.\n\n     END OF MEMORY.\n\n     EXT.

Other people's\n               brains stopped, went crazy. How sweet\n               that would have been. Me and Halle\n               squatting by that churn, smashing cold\n               lumpy butter in our faces, not a care in\n               the world..\n\n                         PAUL\n               Sethe, don't do this..\n\n                         SETHE\n               What a relief to just stop it all right\n               there, huh?!!

And you tell me he didn't\n               leave me!!\n\n     Sethe exits O.S. Paul is left alone on the porch until\n     Beloved runs out of the house giggling with Denver in\n     pursuit. As Denver passes, Paul sarcastically remarks;\n\n                         PAUL\n               Guess she's feeling better, huh?\n\n     Denver gives him a quick, disdainful look, then continues\n     after Beloved.\n\n     The two girls run towards the woods.\n\n     EXT.

Come on!\n\n     She takes Denver's hand and places another on her shoulder.\n     As they dance, Denver laughs harder and harder - a giddiness\n     from the dizziness and the gratitude she feels for Beloved's \n     attention.\n\n     They spin and fall to the ground, like two lovers nestled.\n     Beloved catches her breath as Denver asks;\n\n                         DENVER\n               Why you call yourself Beloved?\n\n                         BELOVED\n               In the dark my name is Beloved.\n\n                         DENVER\n               What's it like where you were before?\n\n                         BELOVED\n                    (a thoughtful expression)\n               Dark.

I stay\n               there in the dark, in the daytime, in the\n               dark in the daytime. Long time.\n\n                         DENVER\n               All this time you were on the bridge?\n\n                         BELOVED\n               No. After. When I got out.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Why'd you come here?\n\n                         BELOVED\n               To see her face.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Ma'am's?

You really are.\n\n     Beloved looks at her and smiles. They are so close she leans\n     in curiously and - touching Denver's face - kisses her on the\n     lips.\n\n                         DENVER\n               You won't leave us, will you?\n\n                         BELOVED\n               No. Never. This is where I am.\n\n                         DENVER\n               I knew it. I knew. First time I saw you\n               and you said your name. And when you\n               touched me - real gentle. And familiar.\n               Like I'd felt that touch before.\n\n     Smiling, Beloved moves to touch Denver's cheek when suddenly,\n     Denver sits up cross legged and urges Beloved;\n\n                         DENVER\n               Don't tell mama. You musn't tell her who\n               you really are. I don't know what she'd\n               do! Please, you hear?\n\n     Suddenly, Beloved's face turns to rage as she rises up as\n     well;\n\n                         BELOVED\n               Don't tell me what to do?

She senses something.\n     She rises and looks out the window to see;\n\n     POV;\n\n     SETHE WALKING ACROSS THE FIELD.\n\n     Beloved quickly grabs her clothes and exits to follow her, as\n     Denver awakens just in time to see her go.\n\n     EXT.

FIELD - NIGHT.\n\n     Sethe, tear stained, bloody and very pregnant fights her way\n     through a corn field as she makes her escape..\n\n     Her dress hangs torn at the back - her wounds open and\n     bleeding. Her feet already swollen and blistered. She is in\n     agonizing pain. She moves like a figure in a nightmare.\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     A SERIES OF IMAGES IN WHICH WE SEE SETHE STRUGGLING THROUGH\n     DAYS AND NIGHTS OF WALKING AND HIDING, IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS\n     AS SHE MAKES HER WAY ACROSS THE STATE.\n\n     THE FINAL IMAGE IS:\n\n     EXT. ONION FIELD - DAY.\n\n     Sethe falls to the ground unable to move - her contractions\n     have started and the pain is unbearable.\n\n     Her breasts are leaking on her sweat stained body. Her legs\n     are scratched and bleeding from moving through broken twigs\n     and rock. On her back, the tree is starting to form.\n\n     She lays there waiting for death. Until a VOICE ASKS:\n\n                         AMY (OS)\n               WHO THAT BACK THERE!\n\n     Sethe can not answer as she hears TWO FEET moving through the\n     field. She clutches her pregnant stomach as if somehow she\n     might hide it from whoever might be coming to harm her.\n\n     A RAGGEDLY LOOKING WHITE GIRL with arms like cane stalks and\n     enough hair for five heads steps through into view.\n\n                         AMY\n               Look there.

What's it like?\n\n     Sethe desperately wants her to stay - to not be alone. Amy\n     kneels back down to her, curious now;\n\n                         AMY\n               What they call you?\n\n                         SETHE\n                    (lies)\n               Lu.\n\n                         AMY\n               What you gonna do, just lay there and\n               foal?\n\n                         SETHE\n               I can't get up.\n\n                         AMY\n               What?\n\n                         SETHE\n               I can't get up.\n\n     Amy wipes her nose and looks up beyond Sethe.\n\n                         AMY\n               There's a house back yonder. Well, not a\n               house with people in it - more like a\n               lean-to near the river.\n\n                         SETHE\n               How far?\n\n                         AMY\n               Make a difference, does it?

ONION FIELD - DAY...MINUTES LATER.\n\n     Amy walks beside Sethe as the latter painfully crawls, taking\n     moments to stop and let the pain go through her.\n\n                         AMY\n               Come on Lu! You got to move faster than\n               that. You won't get to Ohio til you\n               ninety years old, you keep moving that\n               ways.\n\n     INT. LEAN-TO - EARLY EVENING.\n\n     Amy makes a pile of leaves for Sethe to lay on and some rocks\n     for her to put up her feet. She talks non-stop as she works.\n\n                         AMY\n               Never know it to look at me but I used to\n               be a good size. Nice arms, everything.\n               That was before they put me in the root\n               cellar...\n\n     She eases Sethe onto the leaves then lifts her feet onto the\n     rocks.\n\n                         AMY\n               ...Mama worked for these people here to\n               pay for her passage but then she had me\n               and died right after so I had to work\n               for'em..

Gal you a mess.\n               Undo your dress - let me see.\n\n     Sethe makes a tremendous effort just to turn to her side as\n     Amy undoes her dress;\n\n                         AMY\n               Lord, I ain't never seen a poorer excuse\n               for a-\n\n     Amy sees Sethe's back and, for a moment, is speechless.

LEAN-TO - NIGHT.\n\n     To Sethe's amazement, Amy begins to massage her feet and legs\n     the pain of which causes Sethe to cry.\n\n                         AMY\n               It's gonna hurt now..Anything dead coming\n               back to life hurts.

You the dumbest thing\n               on this here earth, LU!..LU!\n\n     Sethe, on her knees, crawls into the boat and props her feet\n     up. Water leaks in wherever it can, rising up as high as her\n     waist. Amy takes her position to assist.\n\n                         AMY\n               Oh Jesus, I'm awful sorry 'bout the\n               braggin...I need you here now..Come on\n               Jesus...don't be getting lost on me now.\n\n     Sethe screams in agony as the child pushes through.

Sethe cannot believe this creature made it\n     through..Amy rinses it with water then, wrapping it in her\n     skirt, holds it up to Sethe..\n\n                         AMY\n               My Lord...She's never gonna know who I\n               am.

BANKS OF THE OHIO RIVER - DAY.\n\n     Sethe awakens, mud-caked, on the banks of the river. Her baby\n     girl crying beside her. Amy is gone. She rises, painfully,\n     picks up her child and continues on her way.\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     MONTAGE - MORE DAYS AND NIGHTS OF SETHE, NOW WITHOUT AMY - A\n     NEW BABY STRAPPED TO HER BODY - MAKING HER AWAY ALONG THE\n     OHIO RIVER...THROUGH HOT SUNNY DAYS AND RAINY NIGHTS WITHOUT \n     PROTECTION...SEARCHING FOR FOOD AND SHELTER...\n\n     FINAL IMAGE IS:\n\n     EXT. RIVER BANK - OAK TREE - NIGHT.\n\n     A thunderstorm cracks across the sky and floods the river.\n\n     Sethe is sitting beneath the oak - the rain soaking her as\n     she breast feeds her baby. She cries out loud - but her sobs\n     and tears are lost in the rain and thunder.\n\n     EXT. RIVERBANK - LATER THAT DAY.\n\n     Sethe walks downriver with Denver tied to her chest. She\n     stops when she sees:\n\n     A FLATBED gliding down river. She can't make out if they're\n     white people or not, so she hides behind a tree until it\n     passes;\n\n     Waiting behind the tree, we see that Sethe is sweating a\n     fever. But Denver seems to be doing fine.\n\n     She sees the flatbed pass her and continues on her way. She\n     sees;\n\n     THREE COLORED PEOPLE - AN OLDER MAN and two boys - fishing.\n\n     She approaches cautiously.\n\n     One of the boys is the first to see her. Sethe's bloody and\n     torn clothes and her feverish face make her quite a sight to\n     the young boy. He taps the Old Man on the shoulder and\n     motions for him to turn around.\n\n     The Old Man takes in Sethe and instantly knows where she's\n     been and why she's there.\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               Headin cross?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Yes sir.\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               Anybody know you coming?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Yes sir.

Each Black Man bends over and waits as the First Man\n     on line threads the chain through his leg iron, passing it to\n     the second and so on...\n\n     As they connect each other to the chain, Camera Pans down the\n     line of men and while not a word is spoken, WE HEAR THEIR \n     THOUGHTS...thoughts to themselves, or, if possible, through\n     their eyes to the man beside them:\n\n                         BLACK MAN ONE\n                         (VO)\n               I'm a make it..\n\n                         BLACK MAN TWO\n                         (VO)\n               New man. New man...\n\n                         BLACK MAN THREE\n                         (VO)\n               Steady now, steady.\n\n                         BLACK MAN FOUR\n                         (VO)\n               Help me... this mornin's bad.\n\n                                                       DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     THE BLACK MEN ARE CHAINED AND KNEELING IN A STRAIGHT LINE.\n\n     The White Guards walk passed them. one White Guard stops in\n     front of the man beside Paul D. He turns to him.\n\n                         WHITE GUARD\n               Breakfast? Want some breakfast nigger?\n\n                         BLACK MAN ONE\n               Yes sir.\n\n                         WHITE GUARD\n               Hungry nigger?\n\n                         BLACK MAN ONE\n               Yes sir.\n\n                         WHITE GUARD\n               Here you go.\n\n     The White Guard unzips his fly and undoes his pants and moves\n     a step closer to the Black Man's mouth.\n\n     Paul D. looks ahead, trembling...He vomits...The Guard steps\n     away as another Guard steps in and hits Paul on the shoulder\n     with a rifle..\n\n     EXT. FIELD - DAY.\n\n     The Black Men work...sledge hammers in hand...\n\n     As they work, miraculously, THEY SING..\"They sing about the\n     women they knew, the children they had been...they sing of\n     bosses and masters and misses...of mules and dogs and the \n     shamelessness of life...They sing of sisters long gone. They\n     sing love songs to Death.\"\n\n     INT. TRENCH - NIGHT.\n\n     A torrential downpour. The men in the wooden cages watch the\n     rain filling the trench, corroding the red dirt wall around\n     them.\n\n     Bugs and human debris swirl around their legs and feet. Mud\n     covering them through the cracks of the scrap lumber roof.\n\n     Some finds rest. other's minds are long gone.\n\n     Camera finds Paul...HE IS SCREAMING. But there is no sound\n     coming from his mouth. Tears flow down his face, but when he\n     touches them, he realizes;\n\n     They are tears of mud. He looks up and the wooden planked\n     roof is breaking under the power of the rain..He looks down\n     and the water is up to his thighs.\n\n     Suddenly, the chain linking his feet is pulled and he is\n     knocked down..He gets up, searches through the mud for the\n     chain and notices it's slack..He pulls as well....\n\n     One by one the men in the boxes realize the chain's end is\n     being undone by the rain, as camera tracks down towards the\n     last box to the dirt wall, into which the chain has been\n     locked...It is giving way within the muddy wall.\n\n     THE MEN BREAK THROUGH THE ROTTED WOOD ROOFS TO FREEDOM...\n\n     WIDE ANGLE;\n\n     AS THE MEN CLIMB OUT OF THE MUDDY COFFINS, GRASPING FOR A\n     HOLD, CRAWLING WITH EVERY MUSCLE OF THEIR BODIES - TO GET OUT\n     OF THE TRENCH before mud and water drown them....\n\n     Paul climbs with the will of ten men, with every ounce of\n     strength he has left...\n\n     END of MEMORY.\n\n                                                       CUT BACK TO:\n\n     INT. COLD ROOM - A WINTER NIGHT.\n\n     Paul D. is wide awake. The memories won't let him sleep.\n\n     Winter has arrived and the night is cold. He lies underneath\n     a thin blanket in yet another sleeping place, even further\n     from the house. He adds newspapers under and around his body\n     to stay warm.\n\n     He looks as if he has given up on sleeping altogether. He\n     hears the door to the cold room open. But he does not turn to\n     look.\n\n                         PAUL\n               What do you want in here?\n\n     Beloved enters the cold room.\n\n                         BELOVED\n               I want you to touch me on the inside part\n               and call me my name.\n\n     She hoists up her skirt and turns her head away.. Paul stares\n     at a silver lard can so as not to look.\n\n                         PAUL\n               When good people take you in and treat\n               you good, you ought to try to be good\n               back. You don't....Sethe loves you. Much\n               as her own daughter. You know that.\n\n                         BELOVED\n                    (drops her skirt)\n               She don't love me like I love her. I\n               don't love nobody but her.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Then what you come in here for?\n\n                         BELOVED\n               I want you to touch me on the inside\n               part.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Ever since you come here - feel like I\n               got a new devil to face.\n\n                         BELOVED\n               You have to touch me. On the inside part.\n               And you have to call me my name.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Ain't no chains on me no more. I don't\n               have to do nothing...Now, go back in that\n               house and go to bed.\n\n     Paul continues to stare at the lard can - like Lot's wife,\n     he's fearful what turning to look will do.\n\n                         BELOVED\n               Call me my name.\n\n     Beloved moves closer, right up behind him, entwining her arms\n     around his body, like chains..\n\n                         PAUL\n               No. Ain't no chains on me...\n\n                         BELOVED\n               Call me.\n\n                         PAUL\n               ...Ain't no chains on me...\n\n                         BELOVED\n               I'll go if you say it.\n\n     Tears well up in his eyes. Paul can feel her warmth. He\n     surrenders.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Beloved.\n\n     Beloved presses her body against his. He turns and grabs her,\n     kissing her with a passion bordering on hatred.\n\n     EXT. COLD HOUSE - NIGHT.\n\n     Denver sits outside the cold house - and listens to the\n     sounds of lovemaking. And cries.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT.\n\n     Sethe, Denver, Paul and Beloved eat dinner...in silence.\n\n     INT. COLD HOUSE - ANOTHER NIGHT.\n\n     Beloved is wrapping her body with a blanket as Paul lies on\n     his bed of newspapers - their lovemaking finished. Beloved\n     gives him a final look - no tenderness or affection or even \n     friendliness. Just a cold look, void of respect or even\n     attraction.\n\n     She exits the cold house, leaving Paul alone. He is on the\n     verge of tears.\n\n     INT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.\n\n     Paul stands above the sleeping Sethe - his guilt driving him\n     mad. He wants to touch her, to wake her, to ask for\n     forgiveness and help. But he can not and buries his head in\n     his hands.\n\n     EXT. SAWYER RESTAURANT - LATE AFTERNOON.\n\n     Paul waits outside in the cold, cupping his hands and\n     breathing inside to keep them warm. He is rehearsing:\n\n                         PAUL\n               Look here Sethe..You ain't gonna like\n               what I got to say but I got to say\n               it...See, it's not the..a man\n               can't...what I mean is, it ain't really\n               me..see, it ain't weakness, the kind of\n               weakness I can fight, that girl is doing\n               it. I know you think I never liked her\n               nohow, still don't, but she is doing it\n               to me anyway. Fixing me, Sethe, she's\n               fixed me and I can't break it...\n\n     Sethe appears, exiting the back door of the restaurant with a\n     scrap pan in the crook of her arm. To her surprise. she finds\n     Paul waiting for her.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Man, you make me feel like a young girl,\n               you coming by to pick me up after work.\n               Nobody ever did that before. Better watch\n               out, I might start looking forward to it.\n\n     She tosses the bones and skins from the scrap pan into a heap\n     before four dogs who wait there as if by appointment.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Got to rinse this out.\n\n     She enters the restaurant. Paul watches the dogs eat -\n     watching them getting what they wanted. Sethe re-appears with\n     a cloth over her head.\n\n                         SETHE\n               You get off early or what?\n\n                         PAUL\n               I took off early.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Anything the matter?\n\n                         PAUL\n               In a way of speaking.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Not cut back?\n\n                         PAUL\n               No, no. They got plenty of work with them\n               pigs..More they can handle. I just..\n                    (Sethe waits)\n               You ain't gonna like what I'm about to\n               say, Sethe.\n\n     Sethe steps forward to hear what Paul came to tell her. There\n     is no apprehension or anger in her look. Instead, a calm\n     resolve - as if she were already able to accept whatever he\n     had to tell her without it being anyone's fault. As if she\n     already knew he cane to say he was leaving her. She smiles.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Well say it, Paul D...whether I like it\n               or not.\n\n     Paul knows what she's expecting. And when he sees her\n     diminished expectation, the melancholy without blame in her\n     eyes....he can't tell her about Beloved. He is filled with\n     respect and admiration for her in that moment. Something pops\n     into his head and out of his mouth that wasn't planned;\n\n                         PAUL\n               I want you pregnant, Sethe. Would you do\n               that for me?\n\n     Sethe breaks up with laughter. Paul joins in.\n\n                         SETHE\n               You came by here to ask me that!? You are\n               one crazy-headed man. You right; I don't\n               like it!...Don't you think I'm a little\n               too old to start that all over again?\n\n     She slips her fingers into his.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Think about it.\n\n     Paul lifts them, putting the tips of her fingers on his\n     cheek. He smiles broadly;\n\n     She laughs, shaking her head. A burden transformed into a\n     gift, so suddenly. They begin walking.\n\n     Sethe and Paul catch and snatch each other's fingers,\n     stealing quick pats on the behind, joyfully. Paul throws his\n     arm around Sethe and squeezes. She lets her head touch his\n     chest. They stop and stay that way for a moment - not\n     breathing. Sethe closes her eyes. Paul looks up to the trees\n     lining the roadside like defending arms against attack.\n     Softly, suddenly, it begins to snow. Sethe opens her eyes:\n\n                         SETHE\n               Mercy.\n\n     EXT. BLUESTONE ROAD - EARLY EVENING.\n\n     On the road towards 124, Paul and Sethe run hand in hand.\n     Snow falling all around them.\n\n                         SETHE\n               I been on my feet all day, Paul D.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Where I been? Sitting down!?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Stop! I don't have the legs for this!\n\n     They slow to a walk.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Then give'em to me.\n\n     Before she can stop him, Paul hoists Sethe up over his\n     shoulders.\n\n                         SETHE\n               You need some babies..somebody to play\n               with in the snow.\n\n                         PAUL\n               I sure would like to give it a try. Need\n               a willing partner though.\n\n                         SETHE\n               I'll say..Very, very willing.\n\n     They continue laughing and moving down Bluestone Road when\n     they are jolted by the appearance of;\n\n     Beloved. Waiting in her usual place for Sethe. Her hands\n     wrapped in a long shawl, waiting to be given to Sethe. Her\n     eyes only on Sethe, not even acknowledging Paul's presence.\n\n     Sethe gets herself down from Paul.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Crazy girl. You out here with nothing on.\n\n     She takes the shawl from Beloved's hands and wraps it around\n     her shoulders.\n\n                         SETHE\n               You got to learn more sense than that.\n\n     She walks on ahead with Beloved. Paul, suddenly icy cold and\n     filled with anger, walks behind.\n\n     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - NIGHT.\n\n     Denver waits on the porch. Sethe and Beloved walk by her.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Evening, girl.\n\n     Sethe and Beloved enter the house. As Paul approaches, he\n     stops before Denver. Their eyes meet. Paul stares at her, as\n     if to ask - \"Who's ally are you?\"...Denver, unnerved by his\n     look, runs into the house. Paul waits on the porch until, a\n     moment later, Sethe re-appears.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Now I know you not sleeping out there\n               tonight, are you Paul D.?\n                    (Paul doesn't reply)\n               You come upstairs tonight. Where you\n               belong...and stay there.\n\n     As if healed by her strength, Paul's face melts into relief.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT.\n\n     Denver is cleaning the dishes. Beloved sits like an angry,\n     upset five year old with her fingers in her mouth.\n\n                         BELOVED\n               She likes him here...\n                    (to Denver)\n               Make him go away.\n\n                         DENVER\n               She'd be mad if he leaves.\n\n     Beloved didn't consider that. Her fingers move violently in\n     her mouth as if something were bothering her...until,\n     finally, she pulls out a back tooth...her lips slightly\n     bloody.\n\n                         DENVER\n               OOoo..didn't that hurt you?\n\n                         BELOVED\n               It's like my dreams...I get two dreams,\n               see..One, I exploding...BUUOOGGG...The\n               other I being swallowed. Sometimes it's\n               hard to keep my head on my neck, or these\n               legs connected to my hips...One day I\n               think I might wake up and I'll be in\n               pieces..\n                    (Looks at tooth)\n               Maybe it's starting.\n\n                         DENVER\n                    (cleans Beloved's mouth)\n               Oh stop. It's just a tooth. Probably\n               wisdom. Does it hurt?\n\n                         BELOVED\n               Yes.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Then why don't you cry?\n\n                         BELOVED\n               What?\n\n                         DENVER\n               If it hurts, why don't you cry?\n\n     Beloved, eases herself into Denver's arms, and cries...\n\n     EXT. WINDOW OF 124 - NIGHT.\n\n     We see Sethe and Paul united as the snow begins to pile up.\n\n     INT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT.\n\n     Sethe lies with Paul, in the dark, her face looking up to the\n     ceiling. Paul is asleep.\n\n     On her face are reservations. She rises, crossing to the\n     window to look out.\n\n     At the same time, Beloved appears silently at the doorway of\n     the room, looking at Sethe - hurt and sad. She walks by\n     without Sethe noticing her.\n\n     Sethe takes a breath at the window, watching the snow fall.\n     Then, as she moves back to the bed,...\n\n     Camera moves ahead of her to:\n\n     A DIFFERENT BED IN WHICH HALLE IS TRYING TO FALL ASLEEP. A\n     YOUNGER SETHE CRAWLS IN BESIDE HIM.\n\n     WE ARE IN MEMORY;\n\n     INT. HALLE & SETHE'S SWEET HOME LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT.\n\n     Sethe, Halle and the baby girl (Beloved) sleep together by\n     the wall. The boys sleep together under a window.  Halle is\n     trying to sleep but Sethe is awake...\n\n                         SETHE\n               What you think about Schoolteacher?\n\n                         HALLE\n               He white, ain't he?\n\n                         SETHE\n               I mean, is he different like Mr. Garner\n               was?\n\n                         HALLE\n               How was he different?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Well, he and Mrs. Garner - they ain't\n               like other whites I seen before.\n               Mr. Garner always spoke soft, for one.\n               Mrs. Garner too.\n\n                         HALLE\n               Don't matter. Loud or soft, what they\n               say is the same.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Mr. Garner let you buy out your mother.\n               Found that house for her to live in from\n               those friends of his in Ohio...\n\n                         HALLE\n               Yep. He did.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Well?\n\n                         HALLE\n               If he hadn't, she would have dropped in\n               his cooking stove.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Still, he did it. Let you work off her\n               fee, lending yourself out on Sundays. He\n               could of said no. He didn't tell you no.\n\n                         HALLE\n               No, he didn't tell me no. She worked here\n               ten years. If she worked another ten, ya\n               think she would have made it? I pay him\n               for her last years and in return he got\n               you, me and three more coming..\n\n                         SETHE\n               He always treated you fair. Called you\n               all men - said he never wanted niggers on\n               his farm.\n\n                         HALLE\n               That's just it. We was men because he\n               said so. We was men because we was on his\n               land. You think he be calling us men if\n               we ever walked off his land?\n\n                         SETHE\n               When we walk, don't matter what they call\n               you. You'll be free.\n\n                         HALLE\n               Sethe..baby girl, that ain't gonna\n               happen. Not by walking, anyway.\n\n                         SETHE\n               What you mean?\n\n                         HALLE\n               Schoolteacher in there told me to quit\n               lending myself out.\n\n     That phrase \"..while the boys is small\"..causes Sethe to look\n     at her sleeping boys..\n\n                         SETHE\n               But..then..how you gonna buy yourself\n               out? Or them?\n                    (points to the children)\n               Or me?\n\n     Halle raises himself up to face her, to give her the final blow.\n\n                         HALLE\n               Ain't gonna be no buying us out, like I\n               did with mama. Or them. As far as\n               Schoolteacher concerned, ain't no other\n               life ahead for any of us but this one.\n\n     Sethe understands, looks to her sleeping children and is\n     frightened.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Halle....what we going to do?\n\n                         HALLE\n                    (whispers)\n               Sixo, ya know he creeps out at night..he\n               says the way they took my ma'am..he says\n               freedom is that way. He and Paul A. got a\n               plan.  They heard of this man, what they\n               call an underground agent...if we do what\n               he says, don't need no buy out.\n\n                         SETHE\n               You mean...? But what if we caught?\n               What'd they do to us? To the children?\n\n                         HALLE\n               Same thing they're doing now, honey -\n               only quicker.\n\n     EXT. SWEET HOME - A DAY REMEMBERED.\n\n     Sethe carries a big basket of berries as young Howard and\n     Bulgar run ahead of her. She turns in the opposite direction\n     and walks along the side of the house to the back entrance of\n     the kitchen.\n\n     She passes the open window of the classroom and hears;\n\n                         SCHOOLTEACHER\n                         (OS)\n               Which one are you doing?\n\n                         BOY (OS)\n               Sethe?\n\n     Hearing her name, Sethe stops and peeks through the window.\n\n     Schoolteacher is standing over the student, who has been\n     writing in a notebook. Schoolteacher licks his finger and\n     thumbs a couple of pages before saying;\n\n                         SCHOOLTEACHER\n               No, no. That's not the way. I told you to\n               put her human characteristics on the\n               left; her animal ones on the right. And\n               don't forget to line them up.\n\n     Although Sethe doesn't entirely understand, something about\n     the words disturb her. She looks to her children.\n\n     INT. MRS. GARNER'S BEDROOM - A DAY REMEMBERED.\n\n     Mrs. Garner is sick in bed with a goiter. Sethe enters with\n     some soup.\n\n                         MRS. GARNER\n               I don't think I can swallow that.\n               Too thick. I'm sure it's too thick.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Want me to loosen it up with a little\n               water?\n\n                         MRS. GARNER\n               No. Take it away. Bring me some cool\n               water, that's all.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Yes ma'am...\n\n     Sethe helps her drink a glass of cold water.\n\n                         MRS. GARNER\n               Yes, you can have quite a few.\n                    (drinks)\n               Mmmm. Thank you Sethe. Now tell me, I\n               know Halle's no trouble but the others,\n               the Pauls and Sixo - how's my brother-in-\n               law handling them? All right?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Yes Ma'am. Look like it.\n\n                         MRS. GARNER\n               They do what he tells them?\n\n                         SETHE\n               They don't need telling.\n\n                         MRS. GARNER\n               Good. That's a mercy. I know he's no Mr.\n               Garner. But after he died, I had no else\n               to turn to. I would've had to sell one.\n               It wasn't even enough selling Paul F. And\n               in my condition. I needed help. People\n               said I shouldn't be alone here with\n               nothing but Negroes. And he is a learned\n               man being a schoolteacher...\n\n     As Sethe fills Mrs. Garner's basin with fresh water, she\n     looks out the window and sees:\n\n     SCHOOLTEACHER outside with his students, we notice HE WEARS A\n     VERY DISTINCTIVE HAT as Mrs. Garners description continues;\n\n                         MRS. GARNER\n               ...I know his ways might be a little more\n               strict but as long as the men do as\n               they're told I'm sure it'll be fine. All\n               right, I'm through.. Talking makes me\n               tired.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Yes ma'am.\n\n     INT. BARN - A NIGHT REMEMBERED.\n\n     Sethe lies beaten and raped, her clothes torn, her body\n     aching and sweaty. She struggles to get to her feet and exit\n     the barn.\n\n     INT. HALLE AND SETHE'S LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT.\n\n     Sethe opens the door to find her children asleep. She is\n     about to wake them when;\n\n     She notices Mrs. Garner's light is on in her bedroom window.\n\n     Sethe, blind with rage, decides there's one thing she must do\n     before she takes her children to the meeting place.\n\n     INT. MRS. GARNER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.\n\n     Mrs. Garner lies ailing through a sleepless night when her\n     bedroom door opens. Sethe enters - her appearance tells all.\n\n                         MRS. GARNER\n               My God Sethe..what happened to you?\n\n     EXT. SWEET HOME - NIGHT.\n\n     Sethe carried her baby girl in one arm, her two boys by the\n     hand with the other...They move as fast as they can.\n\n     EXT. CORN FIELD - NIGHT.\n\n     They arrive at the meeting place where A WOMAN crouching in\n     the field is waiting.\n\n                         WOMAN\n               Hurry up. You're late.\n\n                         SETHE\n                    (hands her the children)\n               Here!\n\n                         HOWARD\n               But ma'am...\n\n                         SETHE\n               Just go with her! Do what I tell ya!\n\n     Sethe carefully hands her baby girl to the woman.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Put sugar water on that cloth for her to\n               suck so she won't forget me til I come.\n\n                         WOMAN\n               Where you going?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Halle wasn't there. I gotta go back.\n\n                         WOMAN\n               You crazy..\n\n                         SETHE\n               Take em out. Now! I'll get there myself.\n               I got her milk...I'll get there...Don't\n               worry.\n\n     She kisses her baby girl, a little too hard perhaps, waking\n     her...along with the boys...\n\n                         SETHE\n               Go..Go! Now!\n\n     Sethe disappears back into the corn field leaving the Woman\n     holding the baby girl... as Bulgar cries out.\n\n                         BULGAR\n               Mama?\n\n     EXT. CORN FIELD CLOSER TO SWEET HOME HOUSE - NIGHT.\n\n     Sethe exits the corn field and heads for her living quarters\n     when suddenly;\n\n     THE FOUR BOYS appears from out of nowhere..two restraining\n     her, one holding a horsewhip....\n\n                         BOY WITH HORSEWHIP\n               You nigger bastard..\n\n     Sethe struggles and is about to scream out when she is\n     slapped and muffled and dragged into the corn field to be\n     beaten.....\n\n     END OF MEMORY;\n\n     INT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.\n\n     Sethe awakens, sweating from having fallen asleep and\n     reliving her past nightmare. She sits up and realizes where\n     she is. She looks beside her and sees Paul asleep. She lays\n     down, pressing her body against his so that there is no space\n     between - enfolding her arms around him.\n\n     EXT. PIG SLAUGHTERHOUSE - DAY.\n\n     Pigs are crying in the chute as Paul, Stamp Paid and twenty\n     other workers push and prod them towards the slaughterhouse.\n\n     Although steeped in pig shit on a wintry day - his hands numb\n     from the cold - Paul D. is in high spirits. HE SINGS as he\n     works much to the amusement of his fellow co-workers.\n\n                         CO-WORKER 1\n               Hey - you like this work so much maybe\n               you best get in the chute with the\n               others. You ain't got much more sense\n               than they do.\n\n     The men laugh. Paul smiles and brushes it off.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Ain't just a job reason to sing. Other\n               things a man's got to look forward to\n               that a job just a way to spend your day\n               til the good times arrive.\n\n                         CO-WORKER 2\n               Good times? Ain't no such day.\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               Now, now...it's all a state a mind, right\n               Paul D. If you can think it, it can\n               happen.\n\n                         PAUL\n               More than that. When a man can make plans\n               then a man can make good times happen.\n\n                         CO-WORKER 1\n               Oh the man's got plans! You saving up for\n               a gold mine, boy.\n                    (more laughter)\n\n                         PAUL\n               Better then gold, my friend. Me and my\n               woman's planning on starting a family.\n\n     Stamp Paid's face registers sudden concern.\n\n                         PAUL\n               New life. Born free, hear! Now if that\n               don't define a good tine, I don't know\n               what does.\n\n                         CO-WORKER 2\n               Nothing born free ever again.\n\n                         PAUL\n               What you talkin? Nobody owns us no more.\n               Nobody gonna own my children neither.\n\n                         CO-WORKER 2\n               Children inherit what come before'em.\n               Just cause you can't see no chains, don't\n               mean they not there. We're not free men.\n               We're somewhere between freedom and\n               chains. And as long as the world is\n               white, that's where we're stayin.\n\n     The truth of this causes the men to be silent as they\n     continue working. Stamp Paid looks at Paul, confused by what\n     he should do.\n\n     EXT. PIG SLAUGHTERHOUSE - LATER THAT DAY.\n\n     The men are on break. Paul sits alone enjoying a lunch packed\n     by Sethe...Stamp Paid approaches and sits beside him.\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               May I?\n\n                         PAUL\n               Free country. No matter what anybody says.\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               I like the way you think, boy. Good. Good\n               to think that way. Friend of mine, Baby\n               Suggs was her name...sort of became a\n               preacher in these parts..that was her way\n               of thinking too. When she was at her\n               best, that is.\n\n                         PAUL\n               You knew Baby Suggs?\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               Oh yes...You're not one of her Sweet Home\n               men, now are you?\n\n                         PAUL\n               Yes sir...Me and my brothers and her son.\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               Oh, I see now.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Sethe told me she died soft as cream.\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               Well...maybe on the outside.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Why is that?\n\n     Stamp Paid looks at him with sympathetic, sudden\n     understanding.\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               You don't know, son, do you? See I had to\n               figure that out first.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Know what?\n\n     Stamp Paid pulls out AN OLD NEWSPAPER CLIPPING from a bag he\n     carries with him all the time.

I can see\n               where you might think it around the eyes\n               but that there ain't her mouth. Besides,\n               why would some black woman's picture be\n               in the paper?\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               You don't read son, do you?\n                    (Paul shakes head NO)\n               You want me to read to you?\n\n     Paul senses something terribly wrong...and doesn't know\n     whether to say yes or no.\n\n     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - EARLY EVENING.\n\n     Sethe is sweeping the porch.\n\n     Paul appears on the road. When he sees Sethe on the porch in\n     the distance, he stops.\n\n     Sethe sees him and smiles - but something about his slow\n     approach to the house sends off an alarm within her.\n\n     Paul makes his way to the porch. He stops before her.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Already fed the girls. You eat?\n                    (he shakes NO)\n               Want something?\n\n     Paul doesn't answer. Instead, he steps up to her as he\n     removes the clipping from his pocket and hands it to her.\n\n     Sethe's heart stops beating for a moment - not having seen\n     this image for many years. But she's survived worse than the\n     telling so she faces him.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Best you come inside.\n\n     She rises and enters the house.

I got us all out. Without Halle\n               too. Up til then it was the only thing I\n               ever did on my own. Decided. And it came\n               off right like it was supposed to..\n\n     She rises and begins to move about the room, circling Paul\n     as she tries to find a way to explain it all;\n\n                         SETHE\n               We was here. Each and every one of my\n               babies and me too. I birthed them and I\n               got 'em out and it wasn't no accident. I\n               did that! I had help, of course, lots of\n               that, but still it was me doing it; me\n               saying, \"Go on\" and \"Now!\". Me having to\n               look out. Me using my own head. But it\n               was more than that. It was a kind of\n               ...'thinking-about-myself' I never knew\n               nothing about before. It felt good. Good\n               and right. I was big, Paul, and deep and\n               wide and when I stretched out my arms all\n               my children could get in between. I was\n               that wide. Look like I loved them more\n               after I got them here. Or maybe I\n               couldn't love'em proper in Sweet Home\n               'cause they wasn't mine to love. But when\n               I got here, when I jumped off that wagon -\n               there wasn't nobody in the world I\n               couldn't love if I wanted to....\n\n                                                       DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     MEMORY... as SETHE NARRATES:\n\n                         SETHE (VO)\n               I had 28 days...28 good days of free\n               life.....\n\n     INT.

Sethe reaches in and picks\n     her up. She sits by a window and breast feeds her as she hums\n     A MELODY.

Whatever amount of God's grace she could\n     imagine and will into being, vanishes with one look into that\n     shed.\n\n                         SHERIFF\n               You all better go on.\n                    (to Schoolteacher)\n               Nothing here to claim, I guess.\n               Look like your business is over. Mine's\n               started.\n\n     Schoolteacher beats his hat against his thigh and spits in\n     the shed before exiting, followed by the catcher and the\n     nephew.\n\n     The Sheriff speaks to Sethe.\n\n                         SHERIFF\n               I'll have to take you in. No trouble now.\n               You've done enough to last you....\n\n     Sethe doesn't move.\n\n                         SHERIFF\n               You come quiet, here, and I won't have to\n               tie you up.\n\n     Meanwhile, Baby Suggs notices who breathes and who does not\n     and moves straight to the boys....\n\n     Stamp Paid extends his arm to Sethe.\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               Sethe. You take my arm and gimme yours.\n\n     Sethe turns to him, the first time she's looked into anyone's\n     eyes and sees Denver in his arms...A sound escapes from her\n     throat as though she'd made a mistake.\n\n                         SHERIFF\n               I'm going out here and send for a wagon.\n\n     He exits. Baby Suggs rubs the boys' hands, tries to raise\n     their eyelids, spits on her dress and wipes away the blood as\n     they slowly regain a dazed consciousness..She whispers;\n\n                         BABY SUGGS\n               I beg you pardon..I beg your pardon..\n\n     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. -\n\n     Sethe, clutching the dead baby to her chest, is led out of\n     the shed by Stamp Paid,\n\n     Outside, a throng of black faces have gathered who stop\n     murmuring the second they see her. Among them are Ella and\n     Lady Jones. They are shocked and pained.\n\n     Sethe is led past them to a waiting cart - in total silence.\n\n     Baby Suggs, at the same time, is getting the boys up the\n     porch into the house. When Denver cries in Stamp Paid's arms,\n     she stops..lets the boys sit and runs towards the cart.\n\n     Sethe is seated in the cart beside the Sheriff. Baby Suggs\n     takes the crying Denver from Stamp Paid..She tells the\n     Sheriff.\n\n                         BABY SUGGS\n               Excuse me..but the child needs\n               nursin..needs the mother's milk..\n\n                         SHERIFF\n               Then she's best come too.\n\n     Baby Suggs approaches Sethe who sees Denver crying and\n     reaches for her without letting the baby go. Baby Suggs\n     resists;\n\n                         BABY SUGGS\n               One at a time!...And you gotta clean\n               yourself up!\n\n     But Sethe only wants her living child. The two women struggle\n     as Stamp Paid does what he can..Finally, Sethe wins and takes\n     Denver with her free hand, undoes her dress and nurse's her\n     with a bloody breast..\n\n     Baby Suggs breaks inside. Breaks right in two, although from\n     outwards appearances, she looks merely numbed by shock.\n\n     A WHITE BOY makes his way through the crowd with a pair of\n     shoes and hands them to her..\n\n                         WHITE BOY\n               Mama says Wednesday. She says you got to\n               have them fixed by Wednesday.\n\n     Baby Suggs looks at him not understanding..\n\n                         WHITE BOY\n               You hear, Baby? She says Wednesday.\n\n                         BABY SUGGS\n                    (taking the shoes)\n               I beg your pardon..Lord, I beg your\n               pardon..I sure do....\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     PRESENT DAY (END OF MEMORY) :\n\n     INT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - NIGHT.\n\n     Paul D. sits at the kitchen table. The story told. Sethe\n     looks out the window...and waits..\n\n                         PAUL\n               Your love is too thick, Sethe.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Love is or it isn't. Thin love ain't love\n               at all...I did stop him. I took and put\n               my babies where they'd be safe...\n\n                         PAUL\n               Didn't work though, did it?\n\n                         SETHE\n               It worked.\n\n                         PAUL\n               How? Your boys gone, you don't know\n               where. One girl dead, the other can't go\n               farther than the yard. How did it work?\n\n                         SETHE\n               They ain't at Sweet Home! Schoolteacher\n               ain't got'em!\n\n                         PAUL\n               Maybe there's worse.\n\n                         SETHE\n               It ain't my job to know what's worse.\n               It's my job to know what is and keep them\n               away from what I know is terrible. I did\n               that.\n\n                         PAUL\n               What you did was wrong, Sethe.\n\n                         SETHE\n               I should have gone back there? Taken my\n               babies back there?\n\n                         PAUL\n               There could have been a way. Some other\n               way.\n\n                         SETHE\n               What way?\n\n                         PAUL\n               You got two feet, Sethe. Not four!\n\n     That jumped out before he had a chance to choose saying it.\n     Sethe has no response...The distance between these two people\n     in this small room is suddenly vast.\n\n     Paul rises, playing with his hat...not knowing how to leave.\n     But desperately needing to. He moves to the exit and stops..\n\n                         PAUL\n               You can set aside supper for me... Might\n               be late getting back...\n\n     Unable to look at her, he turns to exit. When Sethe speaks in\n     a soft, forgiving tone, he stops to listen;\n\n                         SETHE\n               After all I told you, Paul D. and after\n               telling me how many feet I have, you\n               think saying goodbye is gonna break me\n               into pieces?\n\n     Paul turns to look at her and realizes she saw right through\n     him...\n\n                         SETHE\n               You're a sweet man.\n\n     Unable to bear it, Paul turns and leaves...\n\n     Sethe stands still, fighting tears, and whispers...\n\n                         SETHE\n               So long, Paul D.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - DAY.\n\n     Sethe is scrubbing the floor, with Denver trailing by with\n     dry rags.\n\n     Beloved enters holding a pair of ice skates;\n\n                         BELOVED\n               What do these do?\n\n     Sethe and Beloved look up. Sethe smiles;\n\n                         SETHE\n               My Lord...where'd you dig up those?\n\n                         DENVER\n               There for skating on the ice.\n               We have another pair and half of another,\n               I think.\n\n                         BELOVED\n               Can we try them?\n\n     Sethe takes the skates and looks at them with a curious\n     lightness:\n\n                         SETHE\n               Go ice skating? Ha...\n                    (beat)\n               Why not?\n\n                         DENVER\n               You sure mama?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Strikes me that after your man leaves, it\n               might just be the wrong time to be\n               scrubbing floors... might just be the\n               perfect time to go ice skating.\n\n     Denver and Beloved register hopefulness in the light of\n     Sethe's attitude. Sethe speaks to Denver;\n\n                         SETHE\n               Go get the shawls..and find me an old\n               shoe for that half a pair...\n\n     The girls get excited. Sethe tosses the scrub brush into the\n     pail.\n\n     EXT. A FROZEN CREEK - DAY.\n\n     A bright, cold winter day. Beloved wears a pair of old\n     skates. Denver wears the second pair and Sethe has one skate\n     and one shoe..The two girls giggle and fall as they try to\n     skate on the ice... helping each other up. Their skirts \n     whirling...their laughter mingled with screams of delight.\n\n     Sethe, wearing only shoes, watches them and laughs.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Come on, ma'am...try!\n\n     Sethe steps onto the ice and takes a few strides and promptly\n     falls on her rear. The girls scream with laughter. Sethe\n     tries to get up and falls, their laughter infecting her as\n     well. The girls try to help her and fall over each other in\n     the trying.\n\n     Denver rises and tries an independent glide. The tip of her\n     skate hits a bump and she falls, flapping her arms wildly.\n     All three laugh so hard, they start coughing. Beloved goes to\n     Denver's aid.\n\n     Sethe rises up on her hands and knees, her laughter shaking\n     her chest and causing her eyes to tear in the cold air.\n\n     Beloved helps Denver, and falls as well. The two girls see\n     Sethe laughing and play it up even more, a few more times...\n\n     Until, Denver notices something and motions Beloved to stop\n     and look.\n\n     The two glide back to Sethe. Her laughter has stopped, but\n     her tears have not... They gently, comfortingly, touch her\n     shoulder.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT.\n\n     It is a snowy night outside the windows.\n\n     Sethe has laid out blankets and quilts in front of the fire\n     in the stove. She has made sweet milk that she hands to the\n     girls before taking her place in between them, on the floor,\n     facing the fire; Denver, on her right, rests her head on her\n     lap. Beloved sits on her left.\n\n     She looks over to Beloved who is staring at the fire. The\n     illumination highlights her beauty and her profile; the chin,\n     mouth, forehead - all copied and exaggerated in a huge shadow\n     the fire threw on the wall. Sethe can't help but stare as\n     another thought occurs to her;\n\n                         BABY SUGGS (V.O.)\n               ...All I remember is how she loved the\n               bottom of burned bread. Her little\n               hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they\n               slapped me\".\n\n                         SETHE (VO)\n               ...\"Here. Look here. See this mark? If\n               you can't tell me by my face, look here.\"\n\n     Beloved lifts her head towards the fire at the same time she\n     leans back to rest on a propped-up pillow. In the flickering\n     of the firelight, Sethe can see:\n\n     A SMILE OF A SCAR BENEATH HER CHIN.\n\n     Sethe knows before she's aware of it consciously. And just as\n     it hits her, BELOVED BEGINS TO HUM A MELODY.\n\n     Sethe recognizes it as her own melody.\n\n                         SETHE\n               I made that song up. I made it up and\n               sang it to my children...\n\n     Denver lifts her head from her mother's lap to look at Sethe,\n     knowing what is happening....\n\n                         SETHE\n               ...Nobody knows that song but me and my\n               children.\n\n     Beloved turns to Sethe;\n\n                         BELOVED\n               I know it.\n\n     A click. Sethe looks at her daughter, returned. \"There is no\n     gasp of astonishment - no exclaim for the miraculous. For\n     what is truly miraculous is so, because the magic lies in the\n     fact that you knew it was there for you all along.\"\n\n                                                       DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     MORNING;\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING.\n\n     It's snowy white outside. The girls are still asleep in front\n     of the stove. But Denver awakens upon hearing her mother load\n     the stove with dry wood and begin to cook breakfast. Sethe\n     hears her wake up and turns, as she beats eggs in a bowl;\n\n                         SETHE\n               Back stiff?\n\n                         DENVER\n               OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor\n               or the skating.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Could be that fall you took.\n\n                         DENVER\n               That was fun.\n\n     Beloved snores lightly beside her;\n\n                         DENVER\n               Should I wake her?\n\n                         SETHE\n               No, let her rest.\n\n                         DENVER\n               She likes to see you off in the morning.\n\n                         SETHE\n               I'll make sure she does. But first I'm\n               going  make up a nice, big breakfast\n               against that cold outside.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Won't you be late for work?\n\n                         SETHE\n               Don't matter. First time I'll be late in\n               nine years. No great trouble..Whatever\n               goes on out there goes on with or without\n               me showing up on time... don't matter...\n                    (looks at the girls)\n               The world is in this room, baby. This is\n               all there is and all there needs to be.\n\n     Denver smiles - but it is a cautious smile. Something about\n     her mother's statement both elates and disturbs her.\n\n     EXT. BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.\n\n     A conflicted and contrite Stamp Paid walks through the snow\n     down Bluestone road towards 124.\n\n     As he does, he remembers his last conversation with Baby\n     Suggs;\n\n     MEMORY:\n\n     EXT. RICHMOND STREET - DAY.\n\n     A fall day. Leaves ankle high. Stamp Paid is walking when he\n     sees baby Suggs carrying a carpetbag full of repaired shoes.\n     He crosses over to her as he gets her attention;\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               You missed the Clearing meeting three\n               Saturdays running.\n\n     Baby Suggs turns to her old friend - but there is no sign of\n     welcome or recognition. There is a noticeable change in her\n     demeanor. She continues walking. He follows;\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               Folks came.\n\n                         BABY SUGGS\n               Folks come. Folks go.\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               Here, let me carry that.\n\n     He reaches for the carpetbag but Baby Suggs pulls it away.\n\n                         BABY SUGGS\n               I got a delivery around here. Name of\n               Tucker.\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n                    (points)\n               Yonder. Twin chestnuts in the yard.\n\n     They walk a bit, until;\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               Well?\n\n                         BABY SUGGS\n               Well what?\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               This Saturday - you coming to Call or\n               what?\n\n                         BABY SUGGS\n               If I call them, and they come what on\n               earth am I going to say to them.\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               Say the Word!\n\n     Two whitemen raking leaves look up at the sound of Stamp\n     Paid's voice, which was too loud. So he whispers;\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               The Word. What you was put here to speak.\n\n                         BABY SUGGS\n               That's the last thing they took from me.\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               But you got to do it. You got to. Can't\n               nobody Call like you. You have to be\n               there.\n\n                         BABY SUGGS\n               What I have to do is get in my bed and\n               lay down.

He turns back and with a\n     force of will, KNOCKS LOUDLY upon the door. No answer. He\n     KNOCKS AGAIN. Still no answer.\n\n     He steps back, trying to sense if anyone's there. He turns to\n     leave when he sees;\n\n     TWO HEADS in the window. Denver and Beloved. Denver bolts\n     away, but Beloved remains a moment longer - looking in Stamp\n     Paid's eye, then disappearing into the house.\n\n     Stamp Paid is unnerved by her look.\n\n     INT.

We\n     hear her thoughts:\n\n                         DENVER (VO)\n               ..I swallowed her blood right along with\n               my mother's milk. She played with me and\n               always came to be with me whenever I\n               needed her. Me and her waited for our\n               daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt\n               me. I love my mother but I know she\n               killed one of her own, and tender as she\n               is with me, I'm scared of her because of\n               it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing\n               that happened that made it all right to\n               kill her own, could happen again.\n               Whatever it is, it comes from outside\n               this house, outside the yard. So I never\n               leave this house and I watch over the\n               yard so it can't happen again ...

We hear her thoughts:\n\n                         BELOVED (VO)\n               I am not separate from her. There is no\n               place where I stop. Her face is my own\n               and I want to be there in the place where\n               her face is and to be looking at it\n               too...a hot thing..In the beginning I\n               could see her. I could not help her\n               because the clouds were in the way. But I\n               could see her. The shining in her ears. I\n               look hard at her so she will know that\n               the clouds are in the way..I cannot lose\n               her again. I see her face which is mine.\n               It is the face that was going to smile at\n               me in the place where we crouched before\n               I come up out of the blue water. Sethe's\n               is the face that left me. Sethe's sees me\n               in her and I see the smile. She is my\n               face smiling at me. It is the face I\n               lost. Now we can join..a hot thing.\n\n     Sethe comes to the waiting Beloved and smiles. She offers her\n     hand and Beloved rises. Denver exits to them and smiles. She\n     extends her hand to Beloved's free hand. The three women\n     stand astride each other, arms around each other's waist as\n     they walk toward the porch...\n\n     The dusk sunlight creates THREE SHADOWS - three figures\n     holding each other the way Sethe saw the shadows at the\n     carnival...Only they weren't Hers, Denver's and Paul's...They\n     were Hers, Denver's and Beloved's....\n\n     INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - EARLY EVENING.\n\n     The girls rush into the house, and down the hall.\n\n     Sethe enters.

Stamp breathes a sigh of relief.\n\n                         PAUL\n               You remember your price, Stamp?\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               Never found out.\n\n                         PAUL\n               I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always\n               wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for\n               my brother Paul F. Must of been more than\n               nine hundred dollars cause she use that\n               money for Sweet Home for almost two\n               years. But then they hung my other\n               brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess\n               he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what\n               was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't\n               surprised when I found out they tracked\n               down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her\n               price must have been higher than all of\n               us - her being property that reproduced\n               itself without cost.

How we gonna know our\n               price in the future? How are children's\n               children's children gonna know what they\n               cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are\n               they gonna pay for us, if we free?\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               Children ain't gonna need to know that\n               kind of thing.\n\n                         PAUL\n               They'll know. They'll know as soon as\n               they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp.\n               It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down.\n               Schoolteacher didn't just change the\n               outside, he changed the mind..and the\n               blood..and what it carries...and what\n               it's worth..\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               I don't believe that. I won't.\n\n                         PAUL\n               There was a rooster named Mister down at\n               Sweet Home. Last time I saw Halle, with\n               that butter all over his face and me with\n               an iron bit in my mouth, I saw Mister -\n               sitting on a tub. He loved that tub. Like\n               king on a throne. He was a hateful thing.\n               Bloody and evil..But he was better than\n               me.  Mister was allowed to be and stay\n               what he was. Even if you cooked him you'd\n               be cooking a rooster named Mister. But\n               wasn't no way I'd ever be Paul D.\n               again..Schoolteacher changed me. Was\n               never no beating under Mr. Garner.\n               Schoolteacher changed that. Why wouldn't\n               a man run from that? Why wouldn't a man\n               not work, kill, starve, pull out his own\n               heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling\n               that? And it strikes me, it's got to be\n               cause we were something else. And that\n               something was less than a chicken sitting\n               in the sun on a tub.\n\n     He drinks.\n\n                         STAMP PAID\n               I said I had two things to say to you.

It looks more\n     worn than before...neglected, abused.\n\n     A broken window...the front door off it's hinge...a front\n     step splintered and dangerous.\n\n     INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - MORNING.\n\n     Camera opens on the front hall and moves through the house,\n     revealing the same neglect inside;\n\n     Broken furniture, dusty floors, mess and disorder...\n\n     Camera enters;\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING.\n\n     Dirty pans, crusted food on the table, window curtains\n     hanging askew...\n\n     Sethe sits hunched over, asleep, in a chair against the wall.\n     She wears a dirty, torn dress that hangs on her body - which\n     seems withered, frailer since we last saw her...In her lap\n     lies a clean pretty dress she was in the process of sewing\n     when she fell asleep from fatigue.\n\n     A LOUD CRASH wakes her up. Followed by a LOUD FRUSTRATED\n     YELL. Her face registers fear. She realizes where she is,\n     what time it is...and begins organizing breakfast...\n\n     She places the dress neatly on the chair, then grabs a cloth\n     and wipes away the crumbs and dirty plates from supper,\n     placing them in the sink...\n\n     She opens a pantry cupboard to reveal BARE SHELVES except for\n     a SINGLE EGG and a bowl of HOMINY GRAINS about 1/4 full. She\n     searches in a panic for more food - anywhere - opening \n     cabinets, doors - places that never stored food. She realizes\n     there is none left.\n\n     INT. DENVER'S ROOM - MORNING.\n\n     Denver finished dressing. She has been able to maintain a\n     semblance of order about her person and room..\n\n     But as she steps out into the second floor hallway, we see\n     the same disarray as downstairs...\n\n     She passes by Baby Sugg's old room and discovers;\n\n     BELOVED, sprawled across the bed, half naked. Her belly is\n     huge, her body unwashed. She looks, and behaves, like a wild\n     animal...\n\n     A broken lamp lies on the fall - pushed over by her leg as\n     she shifted in bed. Her feet, overhanging the bed, are still\n     touching the bedside table where the lamp sat.\n\n     She is awake now - making a small hole larger in Baby Sugg's\n     old quilt.\n\n                         DENVER\n               You shouldn't be in here?\n\n     Beloved jolts her head up to Denver. She doesn't like being\n     looked at unawares...\n\n                         BELOVED\n               What do you know about it? I sleep where\n               I want.\n\n                         DENVER\n               You best leave that quilt alone. That was\n               grandma's quilt.\n\n     Beloved looks at Denver, then at the quilt - then abruptly\n     tears the hole apart with one strong pull.\n\n     Triumphant, she gets out of bed and exits, passing Denver;\n\n                         BELOVED\n               Breakfast ready? I'm hungry!\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - MORNING.\n\n     Sethe has prepared all the food that was left and placed it\n     on one plate which she sets on the table. She stands at the\n     stove, with her back to us, picking crusted pieces of food\n     off the bottom of the pan.\n\n     Beloved moves straight to the chair in front of the place and\n     begins to eat, shovelling the food into her mouth.\n\n     Denver sees her mother covertly eating the burnt pan crumbs,\n     as she pretends to wash the dishes.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Morning.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Morning, ma'am.\n\n     Sethe turns, not realizing Denver was there as well. Their\n     eyes meet. Sethe wonders if her daughter saw her eating the\n     pan crumbs. She smiles;\n\n                         SETHE\n               You hungry?\n\n     Knowing there must be nothing left, Denver answers;\n\n                         DENVER\n               No, ma'am.\n\n     Sethe looks relieved.\n\n                         DENVER\n               I'll finish those. Why don't you sit\n               down?\n\n     Denver crosses to the dishes, taking the pan from her mother.\n     Sethe nods and crosses to the table, to sit down.\n\n     But as she sinks into the chair, Beloved kicks it away;\n\n                         BELOVED\n               You don't sit with me!!\n\n                         SETHE\n               Baby, don't be like that.\n\n                         BELOVED\n               You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with\n               people who leave me!\n\n                         SETHE\n               Don't talk like that. Your mama loves\n               you.\n\n                         BELOVED\n               I had another dream last night.\n                    (as she eats)\n               The dead man laying on top of me and I\n               had nothing to eat. And the ghosts\n               without skin stuck their fingers in me\n               and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in\n               the light..\n\n                         SETHE\n               Don't say those things. You forget about\n               those dreams..\n\n                         BELOVED\n               You gave me the bad dreams. You left me\n               behind...\n\n                         SETHE\n               Mama told you - I'd give up my own life,\n               every minute, every hour of it to take\n               back one of your tears baby...My children\n               my best thing. You my best thing!\n\n                         BELOVED\n               You're weren't nice to me..you didn't\n               smile at me..\n\n                         SETHE\n               That's not true. I told you, I had to get\n               you out, make you safe...so's you and me\n               could be together on the other side,\n               forever..\n\n                         DENVER\n               Ma'am...\n\n     No one pays attention to Denver.\n\n                         BELOVED\n               LIAR!\n\n     Beloved flings her plate at Sethe, hitting her hard across\n     the eye..the plate breaking...\n\n                         DENVER\n               MAMA!\n\n                         SETHE\n               Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go\n               on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.\n\n                         DENVER\n               But mama..\n\n                         SETHE\n               Go upstairs I said!!\n\n     Sethe's harsh tone is only for Denver. Denver exits the\n     kitchen, afraid to leave them alone...\n\n     As she moves from the kitchen, she hears;\n\n                         BELOVED (OS)\n               I want somethin' sweet.\n\n                         SETHE (OS)\n               We don't have nothing sweet no more,\n               baby.\n\n                         BELOVED (OS)\n               Not for me, you don't! You don't let me\n               eat the pies...\n\n                         SETHE (OS)\n               No. Since mama lost her job, we don't\n               have no more pies..\n\n     Denver walks up the white stairs...\n\n     INT. BABY SUGGS' ROOM - DAY.\n\n     Denver has straightened up her grandmother's room. Cleaned\n     away the broken pieces of the lamp. Gathered the remnants of\n     the quilt..\n\n     She holds the quilt as she sits on the bed, facing the\n     headboard. SHE REMEMBERS:\n\n     MEMORY:\n\n     INT. BABY SUGGS' ROOM - A DAY REMEMBERED.\n\n     Baby Suggs, near death, lying in her bed, chuckles and\n     coughs;\n\n                         BABY SUGGS\n               You mean I never told you about your\n               daddy? About the Bodwins who let me rent\n               this here house while I do my shoe\n               repairing? About your mother's feet, not\n               to mention her back? I never told you all\n               that?\n\n     A NINE YEAR OLD DENVER shakes her head.\n\n                         BABY SUGGS\n               Is that why you can't walk down the steps\n               and out yonder by yourself?\n\n     Denver can't answer.\n\n                         BABY SUGGS\n               Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and\n               learn your letters? You liked going there\n               I remember. Seeing the other children.\n               Then all a sudden, you stop.\n\n                         DENVER\n               There was a boy there...said mama was a\n               jailbird...said he could prove it..\n\n     Baby Suggs face registers the pain of her granddaughter, hurt\n     by hurtful words.\n\n                         BABY SUGGS\n               My Jesus my...What people won't say. Why\n               didn't you come and ask me?\n                    (Denver shrugs)\n               'Fraid I'll tell ya, huh?\n                    (Denver looks at her)\n               Come here, child..\n\n     Denver crawls into her arms.\n\n                         BABY SUGGS\n               You got to go sometime. You got to go out\n               there by yourself sometime.\n\n                         DENVER\n               But you said...you said out there, there\n               ain't no...what was that word?..no..de-\n               fense. No de-fense.\n\n                         BABY SUGGS\n               There ain't.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Then what do I do?\n\n                         BABY SUGGS\n               Know it, and go on out the yard. Go on.\n\n     END OF MEMORY.\n\n     INT. BABY SUGGS' ROOM - DAY.\n\n     Denver has crawled up and snuggled against the pillow in the\n     same position as when she was nine in her grandma's arms.\n\n     INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - DAY.\n\n     Denver has changed into a clean, pretty dress and is\n     approaching the stairs when she passes Sethe's room. It's\n     door is open. She looks in..\n\n     Sethe stands with her back to the door, cleaned up, wearing\n     her best dress and the hat she last wore to the carnival.\n\n     Denver smiles, hopefully;\n\n                         DENVER\n               Mama?\n\n     Sethe turns, startled, to reveal - it is BELOVED in Sethe's\n     best clothes...When Beloved sees Denver, she smiles\n     tauntingly and strikes a pose...\n\n                         BELOVED\n               I look just like her.\n\n     Disgusted, Denver exits.\n\n     INT. KITCHEN - DAY.\n\n     Denver walks down the stairs, entering the kitchen;\n\n     Sethe is on her knees, picking up pieces of broken plate. As\n     she moves the skin on her knees bleeds as it scrapes against\n     pieces too small to clean.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Mama let me help you.\n\n                         SETHE\n               NO!...She wanted me to do it.\n\n     Sethe continues her work, without even looking at Denver.\n\n     Denver pauses a moment, realizing she is of no use here - but\n     knowing she needs to help her mother somehow.\n\n     She looks up to the kitchen, where every cupboard door is\n     open revealing empty shelves...SHE EXITS - HEADING FOR THE\n     FRONT DOOR.\n\n     INT. FRONT HALL - DAY.\n\n     C.U. - FRONT DOOR.\n\n     Denver's hands slowly reaches towards the door lock - and\n     OPENS IT.\n\n     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.\n\n     Denver opens the door, then pushes the broken screen door off\n     it's hinge. She closes the door behind her.\n\n     She begins her walk from the porch to the road. The first\n     time she's ever gone alone..not knowing what she will face\n     beyond the perimeters of her home.\n\n     She reaches Bluestone Road and stops. She looks in either\n     direction and sees not a soul. She takes a breath.\n\n     She begins to walk - to get help.\n\n     A block from the house, TWO BLACK MEN turn a corner and walk\n     towards her.\n\n     Denver stops, frightened, not knowing what to do.\n\n     The TWO BLACK MEN pass her, tipping their hats, saying;\n\n                         TWO BLACK MAN\n               Morning...Morning..\n\n     And they walk by. Denver's eyes speak the gratitude she never\n     got her mouth open in time to reply. Heartened by the\n     encounter, she picks up speed.\n\n     EXT. LADY JONES' HOUSE - DAY.\n\n     LADY JONES - a light-skinned black woman with gray eyes and\n     yellow woolly hair - opens the door to find Denver.\n\n                         LADY JONES\n               Why Denver..Look at you.\n\n     Denver manages to smile.\n\n                         LADY JONES\n               It's been so long. It's so nice of you to\n               come see me.

She looks at Denver as if for the first\n     time. Her face an expression of gratitude. Suddenly;\n\n                         BELOVED (OS)\n               RAAAIN!!! RAAAAIN!\n\n     Sethe and Denver rush out of the kitchen to see;\n\n     beloved running through the rooms, clawing at her throat,\n     causing it to bleed...\n\n                         SETHE\n               BABY!\n\n     Sethe and Denver rush towards into the keeping room. Sethe\n     stumbles over a chair to get to Beloved, kneeling on the\n     floor, ripping at her own neck...\n\n     Denver gets her from behind and Sethe grabs her from the\n     front, pinning her down - trying to stop her from hurting\n     herself. Beloved screams and strikes out at Sethe, pulling\n     her hair, clawing at her as well...\n\n     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.\n\n     Denver exits the house because she sees something unusual in\n     the yard;\n\n     POV - THE STUMP;\n\n     On the same stump that Beloved first appeared, sits A BASKET\n     OF EGGS. Denver crosses to it, lifts it and a PAPER flutters\n     to the ground. She reads it;\n\n     M. LUCILLE WILLIAMS...\n\n     EXT. M.

Mine's\n               got a blue ring around it..Would you like\n               to come in a spell?\n\n     INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.\n\n     Beloved sleeps curled up on the kitchen floor after eating -\n     her mouth still dirty from the meal...\n\n     Sethe, unwashed, her hair uncombed, sits in her corner chair.\n     She is trying to mend a torn dress.\n\n     Denver eats a little from the latest neighborhood gift. She\n     hears her mother mumbling to herself like a madwoman.\n\n                         SETHE\n               Nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's\n               going be doing that..nobody going be\n               writing my daughter's characteristics on\n               the animal side..no sir..I don't\n               care..ain't laying that down..no sir.

She rises cautiously, then sits at the\n     table. Denver rises and gets her some food, placing it before\n     her.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Please mama, eat something...\n\n     Sethe nods...Denver is getting more and more frightened of\n     losing her mother completely...Instead of protecting Beloved\n     from Sethe, she must protect her mother from Beloved.\n\n     EXT. THE BODWIN'S HOUSE; BACK DOOR - DAY.\n\n     A white family home in a white Ohio neighborhood.\n\n     JANEY WAGON, a benevolent black servant woman, opens the back\n     door for Denver.\n\n                         JANEY\n               Yes?\n\n                         DENVER\n               May I come in?\n\n                         JANEY\n               What you want?\n\n                         DENVER\n               I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.\n\n                         JANEY\n               Miss Bodwin.

You letting in flies.\n\n     INT. THE BODWIN'S HOUSE - DAY.\n\n     The house is filled with books and pearl white lamps and\n     glass cases filled with glistening things.\n\n     Denver pushes her feet into the soft blue carpet as she sits\n     with Janey.\n\n                         JANEY\n               You know what? I've been here since I was\n               fourteen and I remember like yesterday\n               when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat\n               right where you are. Whiteman name of\n               Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin\n               were good friends. That's how she got\n               that house you all live in. Other things\n               too.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Yes ma'am.\n\n                         JANEY\n               I never went to those woodland services\n               but she was always nice to me. Always.\n               Never be another like her.\n\n                         DENVER\n               I miss her.\n\n                         JANEY\n               Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was\n               a good woman...Well, I don't know whether\n               the Bodwins think it or not but they sure\n               could use some extra help.\n\n                         DENVER\n                    (hopeful)\n               Ya think?\n\n                         JANEY\n               They getting older now and I can't take\n               care of 'em like I used to. More and more\n               they keep asking me to sleep over night.\n               Now, I don't want to quit these people\n               but they can't have all my days and\n               nights too. I got my own family needs me.\n               It'll take some convincing but maybe you\n               could come after supper - take care of\n               your mama during the day, then earn a\n               little something at night, how's that?\n\n                         DENVER\n               Fine. But what would I do at night?\n\n                         JANEY\n               Be here. In case.\n\n                         DENVER\n               In case of what?\n\n                         JANEY\n               In case the house burn down or bad\n               weather slops the roads so bad I can't\n               get here on time or late guests needed\n               cleaning up after. Anything.\n                    (laughs)\n               Don't ask me what whitefolks need at\n               night.\n\n     During Janey's lines, Denver looks about the house imagining\n     herself here at night...her eyes happen upon A STATUE OF A\n     BLACK BOY on his knees, his head thrown back farther than a\n     head could go, his mouth wide open like a cup and filled with\n     money for delivery tips. On the pedestal are the words' AT YO\n     SERVICE;\n\n                         DENVER\n               They good whitefolks?\n\n                         JANEY\n               Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't\n               good. I wouldn't trade them for another\n               pair, tell you that. But you come back in\n               a few days - give me a chance to lead'em\n               to it. All right?\n\n     Denver nods, beaming gratefully - so gratefully that no words\n     come, only tears... Janey reaches for Denver's hand and holds\n     it warmly;\n\n                         JANEY\n               What is it, child? What's the trouble\n               with Sethe?\n\n     Denver looks at her and we know she needs to tell someone.\n\n     INT. ELLA'S HOUSE - DAY.\n\n     Ella has gathered all the women of the town for a meeting\n     including Lady Jones, Janey Wagon, M.

The\n               killed one?\n\n                         JANEY\n               That what she say.\n\n                         M.

Whipping Sethe every day.\n\n                         GRACE\n               I'll be. A baby?\n\n                         JANEY\n               No. Grown now. The age it would have been\n               had it lived.\n\n                         GRACE\n               In the flesh. And whipping her.\n\n                         M. LUCILLE\n                         WILLIAMS\n               Guess she had it coming a little.\n\n                         ELLA\n               Nobody got that coming.\n\n                         M. LUCILLE\n                         WILLIAMS\n               But Ella- you can't just up and kill your\n               children.\n\n                         ELLA\n               No, and the children can't just up and\n               kill the mama. What's fair ain't\n               necessarily right...\n                    (the women listen)\n               Now you all know how I felt about the\n               whole thing. I know the rage Sethe felt\n               in that shed that day.  We all do. But\n               what I could not understand, and still\n               don't, was her reaction to it. Prideful.\n               Too damn complicated for a black woman in\n               her position before God. But whatever she\n               done, I don't like the idea of past\n               errors taking possession of the present.\n               I don't cotton to sin moving in on a\n               house, unleashed and sassy. Every day\n               life takes enough, takes all a woman has.\n               \"Sufficient unto the day is evil thereof\"\n               and nobody needs more. Nobody needs a\n               grown up evil sitting at a table with a\n               grudge. As long as that ghost showed\n               itself from a ghostly place, I respected\n               it. But once it take on flesh and come\n               into this world, well, the shoe's on the\n               other foot now. I don't mind a little\n               communication between worlds. But this\n               here's an invasion.\n\n     The women agree.\n\n                         GRACE\n               Should we pray?\n\n                         ELLA\n               Uh-huh. First. Then we got to get down to\n               business.\n\n     INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD.: KITCHEN - DAYS LATER.\n\n     Denver comes down the stairs, entering the kitchen.\n\n     Sethe, worn out, looking more beaten and ravaged than before,\n     stands at the sink with an ICE PICK chopping up ice. Denver\n     speaks to her, but she does not turn or acknowledge her.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Mama?....Mama I'm going out..\n                    (no response)\n               Mama, I got a job. Working over at the\n               Bodwins at night. Mr. Bodwin coming over\n               now to pick me up on his way back from\n               town. I'll be staying there nights and\n               coming back here for the daytime. We'll\n               have some money, mama..Mama?\n\n     Sethe continues her action as if hypnotized. Denver\n     approaches her from behind and whispers softly;\n\n                         DENVER\n               I'm going help you, mama. Don't you give\n               up yet.\n\n     Denver touches her gently, but Sethe acts as if she hears and\n     feels nothing. Denver exits.\n\n     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - LATE THAT DAY.\n\n     Denver is sitting on the stump waiting for Mr. Bodwin when\n     she hears;\n\n     THIRTY WOMEN, gathered together, walking up Bluestone Rd.\n     towards 124, SINGING A HOLY SONG;\n\n     Denver is amazed by the sight as the women position\n     themselves right in front of 124 - armed with bibles,\n     crucifixes and whatever other symbols of heavenly power they\n     could find.\n\n     INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD; THE KEEPING ROOM - DAY.\n\n     Sethe is rubbing a naked Beloved's forehead with a cool cloth\n     filled with ice, when the two women hear the singing.\n\n     Beloved rises first and moves to the window to see.\n\n     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.\n\n     The women continue singing.\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     EXT. FURTHER DOWN BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.\n\n     MR. BODWIN, sitting on a wagon pulled by a horse, is riding\n     toward 124 when he hears the singing as well.\n\n     WE NOTICE THAT MR. BODWIN IS WEARING A HAT SIMILAR TO THE ONE\n     SCHOOLTEACHER WORE on that fateful day.\n\n                                                       CUT BACK TO:\n\n     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.\n\n     The women continue singing as:\n\n     Sethe and Beloved, her belly as big as a pregnant woman's,\n     exit the house.\n\n     The women are stunned by the sight and slightly confused by\n     the lack of fear between the women.\n\n     Sethe is holding Beloved's hand. Beloved is smiling brightly\n     at the beautiful singing.\n\n     Denver looks to her mother;\n\n     Tears run down Sethe's face but she is not crying. The sound\n     of the women's voices wash over her like a baptism. She looks\n     to all the women, faces she remembers, faces she has missed\n     although up until this moment was not conscious of missing.\n\n     Then, Sethe looks beyond the women and sees:\n\n     MR. BODWIN APPROACHING IN HIS WAGON. SHE SEES MR. BODWIN\n     WEARING A HAT THAT LOOKS LIKE SCHOOLTEACHERS.\n\n     Sethe's expression turns to fear, then rage. In her ravaged\n     mind, she thinks it is Schoolteacher coming back...\n\n                         SETHE\n               No...No, he's not coming into my yard. He\n               not taking my best thing...No..\n\n     She releases Beloved's hand and moves forward...\n\n                         SETHE\n               No...no...no..\n\n                         DENVER\n               Mama?\n\n     She passes Denver, feeling for the ICE PICK IN HER APRON.\n\n                         SETHE\n               No...NO..NO..NOOOOOOOOOOOO!\n\n     As Mr. Bodwin reaches the thirty women who separate him from\n     124. HIS EYES FOCUS IN WONDER ON THE NAKED BELOVED AS;\n\n     SETHE RUNS TOWARDS HIM AND THE WOMEN, HER HAND EXTENDED\n     HOLDING THE ICE PICK..\n\n                         DENVER\n               MAMA...NOOOOOOO!\n\n     DENVER RUNS AFTER HER. SETHE REACHES THE WOMEN AND LUNGES FOR\n     BODWIN BUT THE WOMEN SEIZE HER, CREATING A HILL OF BLACK\n     PEOPLE. SETHE RISING TO THE TOP, HER HAND EXTENDED. DENVER\n     REACHING HER FROM BEHIND, PULLING HER BACK AND PUNCHING HER\n     OUT COLD AS THE BODIES FALL AROUND THEM....\n\n     Beloved watches from the house - watches Sethe attack and\n     defend with the ice pick.  And something within her is\n     resolved. For a moment, we see a calm spirit instead of a\n     wild animal. And a tear upon her face..\n\n     Then, just as quickly, she sprints around the side of the\n     house and disappears from view.\n\n     The Women try to help Sethe as Denver cries for her mother.\n     Mr. Bodwin looks on stunned.\n\n     WIDE ANGLE - OF A NAKED BLACK WOMAN WITH A FULL BELLY RUNNING\n     THROUGH AN OPEN FIELD, REACHING THE WOODS THEN DISAPPEARING\n     INTO THE TREES......\n\n                                                          FADE OUT;\n\n     FADE IN:\n\n     EXT.

How you getting along?\n\n                         DENVER\n               Don't pay to complain.\n\n                         PAUL\n               You on your way home?\n\n                         DENVER\n               No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt\n               factory. Figure between that and my night\n               work at the Bodwins I might be able to\n               put something away for me and mama.\n\n                         PAUL\n               They treating you right over at the\n               Bodwins?\n\n                         DENVER\n               More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she\n               teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I\n               might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting\n               on me.\n\n     Paul smiles - wanting to warn her but deciding not to spoil\n     the possibilities that lay before her.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Your mother all right?\n\n                         DENVER\n               No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten\n               out of bed since that day.\n\n                         PAUL\n               You think I should stop by? Think she'd\n               welcome it?\n\n                         DENVER\n               I don't know. I think I've lost my\n               mother, Paul D.\n\n     Silence.\n\n                         PAUL\n               That girl...You know, Beloved...\n\n                         DENVER\n               Yes?\n\n                         PAUL\n               She gone like they say?\n\n                         DENVER\n               Haven't seen her since that day. Ella\n               thinks she might be waiting in the woods\n               for another chance but..I don't think so.\n               Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she\n               can feel it.\n\n                         PAUL\n               You think she sure 'nough your sister?\n\n                         DENVER\n               At times. At other times I think she\n               was...more. But who would know that\n               better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough\n               you her.\n\n     She levels her eyes at him and he knows what she means.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Well, if you want my opinion...\n\n                         DENVER\n               I don't. I have my own.\n\n                         PAUL\n               You grown.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Yes sir\n\n                         PAUL\n               Well, good luck with the job.\n\n                         DENVER\n               Thank you.\n\n     They pass each other until Denver turns back;\n\n                         DENVER\n               And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way,\n               but be careful how you talk to my mama,\n               hear?\n\n                         PAUL\n               I will.\n\n     Paul watches her walk away. He watches as a YOUNG BLACK MAN\n     runs towards her shouting;\n\n                         YOUNG MAN\n               Hey, Miss Denver..Wait up!\n\n     He watches as the two young people, the future, walk\n     together.\n\n     INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.\n\n     Paul enters the house and hears HUMMING. He walks towards the\n     keeping room, whose door is ajar;\n\n     INT. KEEPING ROOM - DAY.\n\n     Sethe lies in bed with the remnants of Baby Sugg's quilt over\n     her, as she hums her melody and looks out of the window.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Sethe?\n\n                         SETHE\n                    (turns to him)\n               Paul D.\n\n     She looks like she's dying.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Aw, Sethe.\n\n     He approaches her.\n\n                         SETHE\n               You shaved.\n\n                         PAUL\n               Yeah.

I'm a take care of\n               you, you hear? Starting now.\n\n     Sethe looks at him - a long look - and sees in him that\n     thing, that blessedness, \"that makes him the kind of man who\n     can walk into a house and make women cry, make women tell him\n     things they could only tell each other\".\n\n                         PAUL\n               What, baby?\n\n                         SETHE\n                    (cries)\n               She left me.

They\n               flay it. O, my people, they do not love\n               your hands. Those they only use, tie,\n               bind, chop off and leave empty, Love your\n               hands. Love them. Raise them up and kiss\n               them. Touch others with them, put them\n               together, stroke them on your face 'cause\n               they don't love that either. You  got to\n               love it. You. Yonder out there, they\n               ain't in love with your moth. They will\n               see it broken and break it again.

You got\n               to love it. And the feet that need to\n               rest and to dance. The backs that needs\n               support. The shoulders that need arms,\n               strong arms I'm telling you! O my people,\n               out yonder they don't love your neck\n               unnoosed and straight.

The bar opens.  Revealing a bottle\n               of Dom Perignon on ice. Charlie grins broadly.\n\n                                   TED\n                         We can't afford that!\n\n               Charlie grabs the bottle and starts to open it.\n\n                                   CHARLIE\n                         Don't you know anything about limo\n                         etiquette?

The cork flies through the air.  Bounces off the\n               ceiling.  And hits another switch.  The sun roof glides open. \n               Champagne overflows from the bottle.  All over Charlie's\n               crotch.\n\n                                   TED\n                         Nice.

With an\n               occasional palm tree swooshing by.  Ted rises.\n\n               EXT. LIMO - DAY - MOVING\n\n               Ted's head peeks out of the sun roof. Tentatively. Unsure. He\n               takes in the sights as the limo cruises Sunset Boulevard. \n               People stare at him. A beautiful BLONDE smiles and waves. He\n               waves back, very timidly.\n\n               Charlie sticks his head out, too. Sun on their faces.

It comes to a sudden halt. The door\n               swings open to reveal a group of BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMEN. Clad\n               in very short black dresses and even some black bikinis.  Sad\n               expressions on their faces. \n\n               EXT.

We're so close, we\n                         feel each other's pain.\n\n               The voluptuous beauty notices Charlie's soaked crotch. He\n               winks...\n\n                                   CHARLIE (CONT'D)\n                         See what you do to me, baby. \n\n               Just then, the spry HELEN McDOLE, 60s, emerges from the\n               mansion.  She approaches Ted and hugs him.\n\n                                   HELEN\n                         Oh my, he would have been so proud. \n                         You're the spitting image of him.\n\n                                   CHARLIE\n                         He never spits, ma'am.

Helen\n               sits on his right. Charlie sits on his left.  \n\n               Zukerman and two other IMPATIENT ATTORNEYS wait at the head\n               of the table.  Finally Zukerman checks his watch and rises.\n\n                                   ZUKERMAN\n                         We're running out of time. The\n                         kid's here.

Seconds pass, slowly, slowly.\n               Then suddenly Zukerman rises.\n\n                                   ZUKERMAN\n                         What did the doctor say to the\n                         nurse as they watched something\n                         black and white and red in a\n                         blender?\n                             (a wry smile)\n                         No more patients.\n\n               Very dramatically, Zukerman slides a copy of \"Heaven\"\n               magazine down the conference table. Right to Ted.\n\n                                   ZUKERMAN (CONT'D)\n                         Are you familiar with \"Heaven?\"\n\n                                   TED\n                         I'm seventeen.

A wall panel slides open\n               to reveal a large monitor which springs to life.  On the\n               screen is a striking couple.  Ted'S BIOLOGICAL PARENTS. \n               HEATHER and TOM DEEDS. Heather, stunningly sexy and\n               overflowing from her gold sequined halter top.

It's your job, Ted, to\n                         decide which of them is right.\n\n                                   CHARLIE\n                         Let me get this straight...\n\n                                   UNCLE BILLY\n                         If it isn't straight by now, son,\n                         you probably should see a doctor.\n\n                                   CHARLIE\n                         These are real, live women?\n\n                                   UNCLE BILLY\n                             (winking at Ted)\n                         We don't generally feature blow-up\n                         dolls in our magazine.

He removes the push\n               pin that holds it to the wall.\n\n                                   TED\n                         I like her.\n\n               We can see the concerned look on Helen's face.

He explains gently...\n\n                                   UNCLE BILLY\n                         We don't allow TIPN, Ted.\n\n                                   TED\n                         Tipping?\n\n                                   HELEN\n                         TIPN. Tattoos, implants, piercings,\n                         nose jobs. Our angels must be pure,\n                         unadultered, completely natural.\n\n               Ted looks at the walls again. Carefully. He has a knack for\n               this. He hands a picture to Helen. She turns to Uncle Billy\n               and smiles.\n\n                                   HELEN (CONT'D)\n                             (emotional)\n                         You have your father's eye.\n\n               His father. He just can't get used to that. Who was this guy?\n\n               INT. MASTER BEDROOM CLOSET - \"HEAVEN\" MANSION - NIGHT\n\n               Ted looks at the impressive collection of suits. Runs his\n               hands along the fabrics. Picks a particularly stylish jacket\n               and tries it on. It fits poorly. Too big in the chest and\n               shoulders. Ted looks at himself in the full-length mirror.\n               He's not half the man his father was.\n\n               Suddenly there's a KNOCK on the door. Ted quickly takes off\n               his father's jacket and puts on his own. He lets Uncle Billy\n               in.  LOUD PARTY SOUNDS momentarily pour into the room.\n\n                                   UNCLE BILLY\n                         There you are, Ted-baby.

Uncle Billy helps him.\n\n                                   UNCLE BILLY\n                         You ready for your big coming out\n                         party?

As if pep-talking him for a\n               big fight.\n\n                                   UNCLE BILLY\n                         You're the Sultan of Semen.

KIKI and KELLY.\n               Tall, beautiful, leggy IDENTICAL TWINS.  They smile warmly at\n               Ted, each offering an arm.  Ted holds his head high. Like the\n               Sovereign of Sexuality.\n\n               LONG DRAMATIC STAIRCASE\n\n               With the twins on either side of him, Ted struts down the\n               stairs and into a sea of people.  All so eager to meet him. \n               Ted acts as if he's been doing this all his life.\n\n                                   TED\n                             (sotto)\n                         The Potentate of Poon has arrived.\n\n               And instantly, he's surrounded.  People shake his hands. \n               Women kiss his cheeks.  Athletes, movie stars, models. \n               Charlie watches, beaming proudly.\n\n               DANCE FLOOR - LATER\n\n               Charlie thinks he's Travolta. Dressed for disco. Twirling a\n               Super Model. Ted dances among a dozen BEAUTIES.  They steal\n               kisses and hugs, here and there. A thousand Cinderellas, all\n               after one Prince Charming.  Ted's having the time of his\n               life. Charlie dances up to him. Shouting in his ear...\n\n                                   CHARLIE\n                         Ain't life amazing? A week ago, you\n                         couldn't get to second base!  Now\n                         you OWN second base!\n\n               They high-five one another. An EXOTIC BEAUTY grabs Ted and\n               starts dirty dancing. Rubbing herself against him.  Ted's\n               clueless. So he improvises.  People cheer him on.  He thrusts\n               his pelvis. Feigns various sex acts. Hilarious, goofy, but it\n               works.\n\n               EXT. JACUZZI - NIGHT\n\n               The party's over.  Ted relaxes in the Jacuzzi, sipping\n               champagne. Thrilled, elated, blasted.  Uncle Billy sits\n               across from him.  Two MASSEUSES tenderize their shoulders.\n               But as the scene continues the women take an even greater\n               interest in each other. Stealing a kiss here. A touch there. \n               Ted attention is distracted as he chats with Uncle Billy.\n\n                                   UNCLE BILLY\n                         I told you you could do it.\n\n                                   TED\n                         I was like a different person\n                         tonight.\n\n                                   UNCLE BILLY\n                         You were the new and improved you.\n\n                                   TED\n                         I would have been laughed right out\n                         of Xenia.\n\n                                   UNCLE BILLY\n                         No one will be laughing at you now,\n                         Ted.

She unzips the back of her dress and lets\n               it fall to her feet.  The silhouette of her nude body is\n               startlingly gorgeous in the moonlight. Ted watches as she\n               descends, step by step, into the frothy water.\n\n               Ted's paralyzed with desire and fear. Ginger descends deeper. \n               A wash of foam caresses her breasts.  She continues.  Until\n               she's completely submerged.\n\n               Ted looks startled.  The \"Jaws\" theme echoes through his\n               ears.  He starts to rise. Concerned. When suddenly, he feels\n               something.  Whoa! His swimming trunks land next to him.\n\n               He starts to rise out of the Jacuzzi, when suddenly he's\n               sucked under.  He thrashes.  His hand grabs the edge of the\n               Jacuzzi. But his fingers give out.  And he slides under. Only\n               to rise out of the water with Ginger. Attached to his lips.\n               Kissing him passionately.\n\n                                                       DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. \"HEAVEN\" MANSION - TED'S BEDROOM - MORNING\n\n               Ted and Ginger in bed.

Making their\n               way into the building.  A group of GUYS look up.\n\n               Suddenly, a helicopter swooshes through the air, circling the\n               school as if to get everyone's attention, then landing on a\n               grassy knoll. The helicopter is painted heavenly blue with a\n               pattern of white billowy clouds.\n\n               The door slides open and out hops Ted. In SLOW-MO. Looking\n               seriously cool from the tips of his silver toed boots to his\n               stylish Persol shades.

Looking great, too, but vaguely\n               Mafioso in his efforts to be hip.

You have your father's\n                         impeccable judgment.\n\n               Dad passes the partially open door. Overhearing.

Gives it a cursory glance. Nods to his\n               dad, as if dismissing him.\n\n                                   TED\n                         No problem, consider it done.\n                             (to Uncle Billy)\n                         I had this idea of shooting on\n                         location.

Maybe\n                         at some famous Xenia landmarks. \n                         You think that would be a problem?\n\n                                   HELEN\n                         We'll send you the release forms,\n                         Ted.

Don't you forget\n                         it, Ted-baby.\n\n               Ted laughs. Completely ignoring his dad. Who backs out of the\n               room. Unnoticed. Neglected. Hurt.\n\n               EXT. THE NELSON HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Mom drives up to the house.  She stares, aghast.\n\n               There are tall, beautiful, ANGELS everywhere.  One cuts the\n               grass.  Another pulls weeds. Two others on the roof, cleaning\n               gutters.\n               Still others wash the car...with Jimmy handling the water\n               hose. Drenching the women, more than the car. Shrieks and\n               giggles all around. Neighbors gawk.\n\n               Ted's dad guiltily enjoys the view, but quickly rushes to his\n               wife. She gets out of her car and steadies herself on his\n               arm. \n\n               INT. NELSON LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n               Ted stands on an ottoman as a TAILOR fits him for a prom\n               tuxedo. He towers over his parents who try to talk to him. We\n               feel for them. They've lost control of their kid.\n\n                                   MOM\n                         You have to understand.

What\n                         more do you want from me?\n\n               Dad glances at Mom, hesitant.  She nods, giving him the\n               courage to continue.\n\n                                   DAD\n                         We think you should give up the\n                         magazine. Sell it. Let someone else\n                         run it. Whatever it takes.\n\n                                   MOM\n                         We want you to go to college, find\n                         a career you love, marry a nice\n                         girl from a nice family, and live\n                         happily ever after.\n\n               Ted laughs.\n\n                                   TED\n                         THAT is your dream, not mine. My\n                         dream is so far beyond anything YOU\n                         PEOPLE could even imagine.\n\n                                   DAD\n                         Watch your tone, mister.\n\n                                   TED\n                         Why don't you just admit what this\n                         is really all about?

No wonder\n                         I hated this one-horse cow town. I\n                         come from talented people who took\n                         chances and dared to imagine a life\n                         without limits! I was never meant\n                         to be raised by...GROCERS.\n\n               Ted storms away, unintentionally CRASHING into a TREASURED\n               FAMILY PHOTO on the end table. The frame shatters into\n               smithereens. Breaking Mom and Dad's hearts. STUNNED SILENCE\n               hangs heavy in the room. \n\n               INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT\n\n               Prom night.  Couples slow dance to a Marilyn Manson clone,\n               singing a rock version of \"Precious and Few.\"\n\n               Principal Merkin watches on the sidelines.  Surprisingly\n               calm. Suspiciously happy.\n\n               Ted caresses Ginger's bare back as they dance together. His\n               head nestled against her breasts. Not a care in the world. \n               He spots Charlie on the dance floor. Making out with one of\n               his dates, the IDENTICAL TAYLOR TRIPLETS, while the other two\n               patiently wait their turn.\n\n                                   GINGER\n                         Teddy?

The perfect male specimen. Christy gives Ted a\n               disappointed, longing gaze. But he's oblivious.\n\n                                   GINGER\n                         I bet St. Tropez in July would be\n                         paradise. For a honeymoon. \n\n               Suddenly a FLASH blinds them. It's Julie Conroy, doing her\n               job.  Following her subject.\n\n                                   GINGER (CONT'D)\n                             (snapping)\n                         You could have warned us.\n\n                                   JULIE\n                         Oops, sorry. Warning: You've got\n                         lipstick on your teeth.\n\n               Julie flashes the camera again. Capturing Ginger's panicked\n               expression. We notice that Julie looks alluring in a deep\n               purple strapless gown. Not so glamorous as Ginger, but far\n               more appealing and natural.\n\n                                   TED\n                         Wow...you clean up nice. \n\n                                   JULIE\n                         Put your eyeballs back in your\n                         head, William Randolph.

The senior citizens clap\n               enthusiastically.\n\n               Ted and Julie peek through a crack in the doorway.\n               Disappointment on their faces.\n\n               INT. SOUP KITCHEN - ANOTHER NIGHT\n\n               Principal Merkin pours soup into the bowl of a shabbily\n               dressed HOMELESS MAN. Julie shoots Ted an \"I told you so\"\n               look.\n\n               EXT. HIGHWAY - SATURDAY AFTERNOON\n\n               Principal Merkin supervises a crew of kindergarten CHILDREN,\n               cleaning up the roadside litter. Julie and Ted watch from...\n\n               A BRIDGE ABOVE THE HIGHWAY\n\n                                   JULIE\n                         See what I mean. He's squeaky\n                         clean. He makes Gandhi look like a\n                         war monger.\n\n               Ted steels himself. Somehow, they'll get him.\n\n               EXT. XENIA - WATER TOWER - DAY\n\n               In the golden light of sunset, MOLLY, a stunning \"Xenia\n               Girl,\" stands on the stairs that curve up around a huge water\n               tower that overlooks the city.  Her loose spring dress\n               billows in the wind. Held on by only one button. Exposing in\n               quick glimpses that she isn't wearing a bra. \n\n               An ASSISTANT holds a portable strobe, attached to a\n               reflector.  Charlie shoots with his Nikon.  Motor drive\n               whirling.  \n\n                                   TED\n                         I have a great idea.  Let's lose\n                         the last button.\n\n               Molly grins. Then unbuttons. We hear a round of \"oohs\" from\n               below.  Ted glances down, where...\n\n               Hundreds of binoculars, cameras, and camcorders are poised on\n               the scene.  Men of all ages are milling around, gawking,\n               focusing their long lenses.  Women are conspicuously absent. \n               Except for the gaggle of hardcore FEMINISTS with their\n               placards, denouncing \"Heaven.\"\n\n               One Feminist approaches the Mayor.\n\n                                   FEMINIST\n                         The city tower belongs to the city,\n                         not to some pornographer.\n\n                                   MAYOR\n                         The library also belongs to the\n                         city.  And guess what?  It's going\n                         to have a new Ted Nelson wing with \n                         three thousand children's books.\n\n               The Feminist tries to respond, but a helicopter swoops\n               overhead, drowning out her words. The helicopter rises to the\n               level of the photo shoot where the door slides open.  And\n               just when we think it must have been hired by some hard core\n               fans who wanted a closer look, we find Principal Merkin\n               frowning as he barks through a bullhorn.\n\n                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN\n                         You should be ashamed, young lady! \n                         Your body is a sacred temple!\n\n               Molly flashes him. Principal Merkin averts his eyes.  Missing\n               the sight of Molly's dress being blown off her body by the\n               chopper's prop wash.  The spectators below APPLAUD.  They\n               watch in amazement as her dress floats down to them.\n\n                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D)\n                         Young lady, I will pray for god's\n                         mercy upon your soul.\n\n                                   MOLLY\n                         Don't bother, Merk! I'm already\n                         going to \"Heaven!\"\n\n                                   TED\n                             (to Charlie)\n                         Get them together.\n\n                                   CHARLIE\n                             (eyes lighting up)\n                         Brilliant!  Molly, give me all\n                         you've got.  For Merk.\n\n               Molly gets the idea.  She poses provocatively towards\n               Principal Merkin, who suddenly realizes he's in a\n               compromising position.\n\n                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN\n                         Stop that, stop that this instant!\n\n               But Molly pulls off her panties and flings them at him.\n\n               INT.

He then peers into the...\n\n               SHOWER\n\n               Where Christy Malone limbers up.  Stretching her leg against\n               the wall.

As reflectors bounce strobes into the\n               shower area.\n\n               Years of being a merciless tease, paying off right here and\n               now.

She resumes posing. Flashing a bare\n               shoulder.  A coy look. She doesn't need direction. She's a\n               natural.\n\n                                   CHRISTY (CONT'D)\n                         Remember dress up day?

She's wearing only panties the size of a\n               Band-aid. Ted is mute. Staring at her perfect body.\n\n                                   CHRISTY (CONT'D)\n                         Well? \n\n                                   TED\n                         You have changed since second\n                         grade.\n\n                                   CHRISTY\n                         I mean, what do you think?\n\n                                   TED\n                         You expect me to think at a time\n                         like this?

Out of Christy's sight, he\n               squirms in his jeans. Trying to hide his enthusiasm.\n\n               MUSIC suddenly seems to come from nowhere. Nine Inch Nails.\n               \"I Want to Fuck You Like An Animal.\"\n\n                                   TED\n                             (sotto)\n                         God help me.\n\n               Ted steps back into the shower.

Wanna to do the other one?\n\n               She tosses him the ice cube. He fumbles. It lands on the\n               floor.\n\n                                   TED\n                         You're doing just fine, Christy.\n                         Believe me.\n\n                                   CHRITY\n                         Then I'm ready when you are.\n\n               Ted looks through the lens. We can see him trembling.  Music\n               blasts as Ted's camera burns through film.  They're both\n               getting into it.  Water pulsating over her body. Steam\n               rising.  Christy begins lathering her breasts.\n\n                                   CHRISTY\n                         I was always too shy to admit how\n                         much I liked you.\n\n                                   TED\n                         Come on, I was hamburger.

But inside,\n                         deep down, I've always been\n                         dripping with special sauces. \n                             (she smiles, sexily)\n                         Are you hungry?\n\n               Is he hungry. He's been working up this appetite for ten\n               years. He can barely contain himself.\n\n                                   TED\n                         God, you are so hot. \n\n                                   CHRISTY\n                         Then you better get in the water,\n                         before you get burned. \n\n               Ted calls her bluff. He sets aside his camera. Walks right\n               into the water. Through the steam.  Toward Christy. She wraps\n               a leg around him, sucking face, wanting more.\n\n                                   CHRISTY (CONT'D)\n                         You and me, finally. This will be\n                         so fantastic, Teddy Bear. Trust me.\n\n               Suddenly Ted stops. Remembering what Julie said about trust. \n\n                                   TED\n                         I'm sorry, Christy.

Wrapping her hands around his waist. Caressing his\n               chest, his stomach...\n\n                                   CHRISTY\n                         Sure you can.

Rolling on the\n               floor. Hands, arms, lips, tongues, all in motion. As the\n               shower drenches them.\n\n               Suddenly, they roll into a pair of legs.  Both look up.  The\n               steam clears to reveal Julie. Arms crossed. Hurt, but not\n               surprised. \n\n                                   JULIE\n                         What's up, doc?\n\n               She doesn't wait for an explanation.

TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\n               Julie dashes out of the girls' locker room, passing a\n               JANITOR.  Ted follows, dripping water.\n\n                                   JANITOR\n                         I'm sorry, Mr. Ted.

Ted stops at the door. \n               Then realizes there is no one else around.  He heads inside.\n\n               INT. GIRLS' RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Julie's too proud to let him see her cry. But we can tell\n               she's upset.\n\n                                   JULIE\n                         Go away, Ted. Just go.\n\n               Ted corners her near a row of sinks.\n\n                                   TED\n                         Please believe me. It was just a\n                         kiss for old time's sake. I've had\n                         a stupid crush on her since I was\n                         seven, but I never got closer to\n                         her than four feet and then there\n                         she was right in front of me,\n                         completely naked.\n\n               Julie looks at him, pensively. She unzips the back of her\n               summery dress. And lets it fall to the floor. She's\n               completely naked and absolutely gorgeous.\n\n               Ted gasps. He's been around dozens of naked women by now, but\n               this one he can't just gawk at. This one he really cares\n               about. \n\n                                   JULIE\n                         Being naked is no big deal. It has\n                         nothing to do with emotion, nothing\n                         to do with love.

It's\n                         comforting, you know? It fulfills\n                         their expectations.\n\n               The stockholders are listening.

I not only moved the canned\n                         peaches, I restocked the shelves\n                         with kiwi, guava, and mandarin\n                         oranges in heavy syrup. I\n                         challenged people's expectations. \n                         And you can't do that to your\n                         customers.

LOVETT (V.O.)\n               The Beadle calls on her, all polite,\n               Poor thing, poor thing.\n               The Judge, he tells her, is all contrite,\n               He blames himself for her dreadful plight\n               She must come straight to his house tonight!\n               Poor thing, poor thing.\n\n13   INT. TURPIN'S MANSION -- BALLROOM -- FLASHBACK -- NIGHT       13\n\n     The Beadle ushers Lucy into a ballroom. She is shocked to see\n     a fancy-dress ball in progress.\n\n     Masked couples swirl around the ballroom, their number\n     sinisterly multiplied by the distorting mirrors that frame\n     the room. The hanging chandeliers, draped in red cloth, cast\n     a disquieting incarnadine glow on the proceedings...\n\n                         MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)\n               Of course, when she goes there,\n               Poor thing, poor thing,\n               They're having this ball all in masks.\n\n     Lucy wanders lost through the swirling dancers, they buffet\n     her, confusing her...\n\n                         MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)\n               There's no one she knows there,\n               Poor dear, poor thing,\n               She wanders tormented, and drinks,\n               Poor thing.\n               The Judge has repented, she thinks,\n               Poor thing.\n               \"Oh, where is Judge Turpin?\" she asks.\n\n     The Beadle finds Lucy again and graciously gives her his arm,\n     leading her through the party. She is thankful for the\n     salvation he provides. He brings her to Judge Turpin.\n\n     The Judge descends on Lucy, raping her. The other guests\n     crowd around ravenously, enjoying the spectacle. A feverish\n     nightmare.\n\n                         MRS.

Within that, something\n     covered with a velvet cloth. She removes it and carefully\n     unwraps it. Her touch is particularly gentle and respectful.\n\n     We discover it is a fine leather case. She looks at it for a\n     beat.

Her\n     intense, melancholy expression moves him.\n\n     She continues singing, the strange anguish and yearning of\n     her words seem intended only for him...\n\n                         JOHANNA\n               My cage has many rooms,\n               Damask and dark.\n               Nothing there sings,\n               Not even my lark.\n               Larks never will, you know,\n               When they're captive.\n\n                                                        (CONTINUED)\n                                                                     PAGE 21.\n17   CONTINUED:                                                     17\n\n                  Teach me to be more adaptive.\n\n                  Green finch and linnet bird,\n                  Nightingale, blackbird,\n                  Teach me how to sing.\n                  If I cannot fly,\n                  Let me sing.\n\n     Then she turns away quickly, alarmed, when someone enters her\n     room. She looks terrified.\n\n     Below, Anthony is concerned for her. He sees her move from\n     the window.\n\n     He is craning to see better when a BEGGAR WOMAN -- a filthy\n     tendril of a woman, her foul clothes of rags like a second\n     skin -- suddenly thrusts her arm up from the curb, imploring:\n\n                            BEGGAR WOMAN\n                  Alms! ...

He sees a figure standing at a\n     window, unclear behind the shutters, watching him.\n\n     He sits on a bench outside the mansion and sings quietly:\n\n                         ANTHONY\n               I feel you,\n               Johanna,\n               I feel you.\n               I was half convinced I'd waken,\n               Satisfied enough to dream you.\n               Happily I was mistaken, Johanna!\n               I'll steal you,\n               Johanna,\n               I'll steal you...\n\n     Then the figure disappears from the window above. Anthony\n     stands, waits. Then the doors to the mansion swing open...\n\n     Anthony is expecting Johanna...\n\n     But it is Judge Turpin, the predator we met in Todd's\n     flashback, who steps into the doorway.\n\n     He seems a different man now. Paternal and warm, he smiles\n     and beckons to Anthony.\n\n     Anthony hesitates, unsure. The Judge beckons again. Again the\n     warm smile.\n\n                         JUDGE\n               Come in, lad. Come in...\n\n     Anthony goes into the mansion.\n\n18   INT.

A\n     steady mercantile hum as the cries of merchants and wandering\n     coster-mongers fill the air.\n\n     Todd and Mrs. Lovett move toward a hand-drawn caravan\n     dominating one corner of the marketplace.

Pirelli poses splendidly for a\n     moment.

Let the challenge commence!\n\n     One man sits in Todd's plain chair as the other moves to an\n     elaborate chair on Pirelli's caravan. Pirelli shakes out a\n     fancy bib with a flourish and covers his man. Toby prepares\n     Pirelli's ornate shaving supplies as Todd takes a plain towel\n     and tucks it around his man's neck.\n\n                         BEADLE\n               Ready?\n\n                         PIRELLI\n               Ready!\n\n                         TODD\n               Ready.\n\n                         BEADLE\n               The fastest, smoothest shave is the\n               winner.\n\n     He blows his shrill whistle. Agitated music begins.\n\n     Pirelli strops his razor quickly, Todd in a leisurely manner.\n     Pirelli keeps glancing at Todd in various paranoid ways\n     throughout, frightened of Todd's progress. He starts whipping\n     up lather rapidly:\n\n                         PIRELLI\n                   (while mixing furiously)\n               Now, signorini, signori,\n               We mix-a da lather\n               But first-a you gather\n               Around, signorini, signori,\n               You looking a man\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n                                                                  PAGE 32.\n22   CONTINUED: (6)                                               22\n\n               Who have had-a da glory\n               To shave-a da Pope.\n               Mr. Sweeney-so-smart--\n                   (Splatters the customer\n                     with shaving cream)\n               Oh, I beg-a you pardon -- 'll\n               Call me a lie, was-a only a cardinal--\n               Nope!\n               It was-a da Pope!\n\n     Unexpectedly, Todd still shows no signs of starting to shave\n     his man. He merely watches Pirelli's performance. Mrs. Lovett\n     looks at him nervously, wishing he would get on with it.\n\n     Pirelli, now feeling he can take his time, sings lyrically as\n     he lathers and shaves with rhythmic scrapes and elaborate\n     gestures of wiping the razor.\n\n                         PIRELLI\n               To shave-a da face,\n               To cut-a da hair,\n               Require da grace\n               Require da flair,\n               For if-a you slip,\n               You nick da skin,\n               You clip-a da chin,\n               You rip-a da lip a bit\n               Beyond-a repair!\n\n     Todd strops his razor slowly and deliberately -- shoop,\n     shoop, shoop -- disconcerting Pirelli and drawing the crowd's\n     attention.\n\n                         PIRELLI\n               To shave-a da face\n               Or even a part\n               Widout it-a smart\n               Require da heart.\n               Not just-a da flash,\n               It take-a panache,\n               It take-a da passion\n               For da art.\n\n     Todd is unconcerned.

The grisly\n      tools of her trade are scattered about the place: a large,\n      stained chopping block; a meat grinder; buckets of\n      questionable viscous liquid; cleavers and bone saws and meat\n      hooks; wet sewer grates for the blood.\n\n      A metal sheet, hinged at the top, has been attached to cover\n      an opening in the wall: the mouth of the chute from the\n      barber shop above.\n\n                                                         (CONTINUED)\n                                                                   PAGE 101.\n103   CONTINUED:                                                  103\n\n      And eeriest of all ... the thundering roar of flame coming\n      from a large industrial oven against one wall.\n\n      Toby takes in the cavernous bakehouse:\n\n                             TOBY\n                   Coo, quite a stink, ain't there?\n\n      She indicates the sewer grates:\n\n                             MRS.

FOGG'S ASYLUM -- EVENING                              105\n\n       A cacophony of madness. The ragged inmates of the asylum are\n       slammed together in a series of cramped cells, the low\n       ceiling pressing down.\n\n       We discover Anthony, dressed as a fashionable wigmaker,\n       walking past the cells with the odious MR.

Anthony sees\n       Johanna, wearing a filthy straitjacket, hunched like a feral\n       animal, cowering in a corner of the cell.\n\n                           ANTHONY\n                     (points)\n                 That one has hair the shade I need.\n\n\n                                                          (CONTINUED)\n                                                                    PAGE 103.\n105   CONTINUED:                                                   105\n\n      Fogg goes to fetch Johanna, hauls her to Anthony:\n\n                             FOGG\n                   Come, child. Smile for the gentleman\n                   and you shall have a sweetie.\n\n      Johanna's eyes shoot wide when she sees Anthony, but she says\n      nothing.\n\n                             FOGG\n                       (prepares scissors)\n                   Now, where shall I cut?\n\n      Before Fogg can react -- Anthony pulls a revolver from his\n      clothing, grabs Johanna and pushes Fogg back into the cell.\n      He swings the cell door shut, locking Fogg in.\n\n                             ANTHONY\n                   Not a word, Mr. Fogg, or it will be\n                   your last ... Now, I leave you to the\n                   mercy of your \"children.\"\n\n      He grabs Johanna and pulls her away.\n\n      Mr. Fogg turns. He is locked in with the blonde inmates. They\n      slowly begin to advance on him. Menacing. It is likely they\n      are going to rip him limb from limb...\n\n106   EXT.

One disembodied skate rolls across the room.\n\nSc 7     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE DRAWING ROOMNIGHT     Sc 7\n\nThe woman stands at a window lit by moonlight. Her skin appears \nluminescently white. She touches the wooden window frame, the curtain, \nthe objects on the window sill, her mind abstracted, her hands \nunconsciously performing a farewell. Turning from the window she moves \nto a square piano crowded by packing boxes. In the dim light she \nbegins to play strongly. Her face strains, she is utterly involved, \nunaware other own strange guttural sounds that form an eerie \naccompaniment to the music.\n\nAn old maid in night-dress looks in. Abruptly the woman stops playing. \nThe emotion leaves her face, it whitens and seems solid like a wall.\n\n                    CUT TO BLACK\n\nSc 8     EXT     UNDERWATER BEACH          DAY     Sc 8\n\nUnder water a long boat passes overhead, its oars breaking the \nsurface.\n\nSc 9     EXT     BEACH                    DAY     Sc 9\n\nAmidst a riotous sea a woman, ADA, is carried to shore on the \nshoulders of five seamen.

We should be forgiven if this woman seems a sacrificial \noffering as the bay they carry her to is completely uninhabited.

After a discussion in which they look \nbetween ADA and her child and their Coaster out on the sea, one of the \nmen approaches.

The wetness, closeness and darkness of the bush is such \nthat the air seems green, like at the bottom of a deep sea. Two of the \nMAORIS share one pair of shoes and all of them are clothed in a \nmixture of native and European costume. Of the Europeans one is small \nand has a shy manner. He has a half completed Maori tattoo across his \ncheeks. The other is a similar age about 45 and wears a suit, muddy \nand out of place here in the bush. He staggers, spurts forward then \nslows to a stop. His hair and face are wet and his skin reflects the \ngreen foliage.

The sea is calmer and the tide is again low. The \nparty or two EUROPEANS and fourteen MAORI MEN and WOMEN come out on to \nthe beach. About half the MAORI party head straight for the shoreline \nwhere an older woman loudly organises a pipi collection. All sorts of \ncontainers are used from flax baskets to shirts with knots in their \narms. The rest follow STEWART and BAINES over to the boxes. STEWART \nautomatically re-combs his hair, patting it against his forehead, \nwhere it sticks in a raked pattern. On his head he carefully places a \nformal top hat, oddly dean compared to his mud splattered suit.

Soon, ADA has removed \nenough boards that she may lift the lid and play the keys. EMNES stays \nback. ADA takes great delight in feeling her fingers on the keys \nagain. Her whole composition is altered. She is animated, joyful, \nexcited.\n\nDown on the wet sand FLORA does a wild dance of her own invention \nusing a seaweed wig. She finishes by rolling down the beach in the \nsand.\n\nBAINES views them with suspicion, yet he is magnetically drawn to the \nspectacle He has never seen women behave with so much abandon. His \nattention fixes on ADA's uninhibited emotional playing, and as he \nwatches, he finds himself edging irresistibly closer.\n\nSc 30     EXT     BEACH                    LATE AFTER NOONSc 30\n\nThe shadows are long on the sand when BAIN'ES collects the boards. ADA \nand FLORA are attempting a duet. ADA notices him come towards them \nwith the boards, obviously intending that they should leave. Her mood \ndarkens, she continues playing stubbornly even though FLORA has \nstopped. Abruptly she finishes. In black spirits she replaces her cape \nand bonnet. BAINES is struck by this sudden change, he watches her \nmesmerised as he replaces the boards.\n\nSc 31     EXT     BEACH                    NIGHT          Sc 31\n\nFrom a helicopter, the camera tracks along the beach, following the \ncrashing wave line, to find the piano.\n\nSCENE 32 DELETED\n\nSc 33     EXT     STEWART'S HUT & KITCHEN     DUSK          Sc 33\n\nThe hut puffs smoke out into the valley. The lie of the land traps \nsound like a shell and the clear high notes of a voice echo out. \nSuspicious that ADA is singing, STEWART approaches the house quietly. \nThrough the open kitchen door he sees that the keys of a piano have \nbeen etched on the table top. While ADA \"plays\" the notes FLORA sings \nthem.\n\nSTEWART puts his pack down.

ADA seizes this opportunity to return to \nthe uncertain sanctuary of her piano. From the bed, BAINES watches her \nrun a hand noiselessly over the polished ivory keys, a gesture \nbetraying affection never afforded to him. BAINES gets up.

Putting the cloth aside she sits at \nthe piano to begin playing.\n\nShe starts with wholehearted feeling, her eyes closed, but before long \nshe is surprised by a moving reflection across the piano and she \n'starts', glancing over her shoulder. She stops and begins again. But \nonce more a reflex has her glance across her left shoulder and she \npauses in her playing. Disquieted she starts again and again she looks \naway.

ADA is flushed, shocked, the two face each \nother at this very moment of profound awareness of each other, \nprofoundly equal. With each new breath, with every moment that their \neyes remained locked together the promise of intimacy is confirmed and \nreconfirmed and detailed until like sleepwalkers who do not know how \nthey came to wake where they did, they are standing next to each other \nand beginning to kiss each other, the lips, the cheeks, the nose. \nThere is nothing practised about their tenderness, only their feelings \nand emotions guide their instincts. BAINES' face crumples with the \nexquisite pain of his pleasure, ADA cradles his head to her chest. \nBAINES struggles through her dress anxious to touch her skin.\n\nSc 91     EXT/INT     BAINES' HUT          DAY     Sc 91\n\nOutside STEWART surveys the hut suspiciously. BAINES' dog growls as he \nclimbs on to the small verandah. Carefully STEWART peers through some \nloosely slatted boards. There are sounds inside which are worrying \nhim. By standing on the seat he has found a spyhole where he can see \nADA and BAINES kissing, undressing\n\nHe reels back angry, but just as we might expect him to burst through, \nhe steps up to look again; the fatal second look, the look for \ncuriosity. He watches BAINES bare-chested undressing ADA, her buttons \nburst, ADA laughs, BAINES touches her under her skirts - anywhere, he \ntakes himself under her dress pulling down her stockings. STEWART \nwatches, stepping down to peer lower as BAINES buries into ADA's \nskirt. He does not seem to notice the dog licking his hand. Suddenly \nhe pulls his hand away and looks at it, wet with dog saliva, he wipes \nit on the boards and continues watching as if mesmerised.\n\nSc 92     INT     BAINES' BEDROOM     DAY     Sc 92\n\nInside BAINES' small bedroom the raw dark boards contrast with the \nsoftness, whiteness of BAINES' and ADA's bodies, The long black \nstrands of ADA's hair stick to her cheek and wrap around her neck. Her \nface is flushed and her eyes are bright. BAINES rolls his face across \nher chest, gently, slowly savouring the flavour of her body. Drunkenly \nthey continue their sex slowly, slowly.

Will you come \n               again?\n\nADA is distracted, collecting her buttons from the floor, concerned at \nthe time past, worried to dress and return.\n\nThe camera cranes down and down to find STEWART wedged under the loose \nwooden floor slats. He cannot hear clearly, but ADA's hand reaching \nfor each button is only inches away. One falls through a slat on to \nSTEWART'S neck and on down his shirt collar. As she stands he rolls \nout.\n\n                         BAINES\n               Wait! I don't know what you're \n               thinking.

Ada, do you love me?\n\nADA considers this question. Clearly she doesn't know, the question is \nmore complex to her than to him, then as if by way of answer she \nkisses him strongly and sexually. BAINES pulls away confused. ADA \nfinishes dressing. BAINES comes up behind her to help with the \nbuttons.\n\n                         BAINES\n               (anxiously) Come tomorrow.

She strokes so \nsoftly, the tenderness is shocking to him. Gently she pulls his under-\ngarment down, exposing his buttocks. STEWART grabs nervously at them, \nhauling them up with his hands. ADA unclenches his fist and once more, \nslowly pulls them down. She begins to stroke his buttocks, STEWART is \npainfully eroticised, painfully vulnerable, he begins to weep, the \nintimacy and soft-ness unman him and he is helpless.

It's a\n          miracle!\n                    DOROTHEA\n          But he's a high school kid, okay?\n          It's too much. I'm telling you.\n                    ABBIE\n          I think he seems really okay with\n          it.\n                    DOROTHEA\n          It's not like you actually know\n          what you're doing here.\nAbbie's stung - hurt, betrayed.\n\n\nINT.
