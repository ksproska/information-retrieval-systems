INT.  \"THE DRAGON\" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                            1.\n\n       A Chinese GONG SOUNDS and the glittering doors of an art Deco pa-\n       poda slide open to reveal a mammoth silver stairway down which\n       rows of beautiful women start descending   (BEGIN MAIN TITLES)\n\n       The lovely ladies are a mix of races and they sing a strange,\n       haunting melody -- one might think them a heavenly choir, if it\n       weren't for their sexy, clinging lame gowns.\n\n2.     INT.  CLUB ENTRANCE                                             2.\n\n       From the ethereal beauties, we cut to a street urchin's dirty\n       face: SHORT ROUND is a ten-year-old Chinese kis wearing a beat-\n       up American baseball cap.\n\n       Sneaking into the club, Short Round weaves past the fancy gowns\n       and silk suits, heading toward the music in the main ballroom.\n\n3.     INT.  THE BALLROOM                                              3.\n\n       Short Round enters and stares across the smoky nightclub.  On the\n       stage, he sees a giant paper-mache dragon laying curled around\n       the pagoda.\n\n       Now, the dragon's eyes light up, its nostrils exhale smoke and\n       its enormous jaws open.  Out of the dragon's mouth walks the star\n       of the stage show:\n\n       WILLIE SCOTT, a dreamy beauty singing a sultry solo white the or-\n       chestra wails the accompaniment.\n\n       But Short Round's not here to ogle crooning dames.  He surveys\n       the rich Chinese, American and European revelers.  Jewels flash\n       and champagne flows.  Short Round finally spots a table of\n       somber-looking Chinese men in suits.\n\n       Short Round chews gum and stares at the men.  Then he turns to\n       go.  WU HAN, a waiter with a scar across his cheek, watches Short\n       Round leave.\n\n4.     INT.  CLUB ENTRANCE                                            4.\n\n       As Short Round hurries toward the exit, he bumps into a man in a\n       tuxedo entering the club.  Short Round looks up at the man, but\n       we don't see his face.\n\n       Then Short Round is grabbed by the scruff of his neck and a door-\n       man hustles him out the door, Short Round yelling insults all the\n       way.\n\n       A maitre d' apologizes to the man in the tuxedo and two hat-check\n       girls smile at him familiarly as he continues into the ballroom.\n       We notice something incongruous:  the man in the tuxedo is wear-\n       ing work boots caked with mud.\n\n5.     INT.  THE BALLROOM                                             5.\n\n       The man in the tuxedo stops to watch Willie Scott singing sexily\n       on the stage.  Then he looks around and sees the table of somber\n       Chinese men that Short Round spotted earlier.\n\n       As the man in the tuxedo walks toward the table, he removes a\n       cigarette from a silver case.  He arrives at the table just as\n       the chorus and orchestra reach a crescendo --\n\n       And on the stage, a glistening, muscular slave swings a huge ham-\n       mer toward an enormous brass gong --\n\n       The man in the tuxedo leans to receive a light from a cigarette-\n       girl and, as the GONG BOOMS, the match flares to reveal his face\n       for the first time:\n\n       It's INDIANA JONES.  Elegant in a tuxedo -- dressed to kill.  The\n       TITLES END and over this a legend appears on the screen:\n\n                                SHANGHAI - 1935\n\n       At the table, the four Chinese man in suits stare coldly at Indi-\n       ana.\n\n                                   LAO\n                       Dr. Jones.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Lao She.\n\n                                   LAO\n                       Nee chin lie how ma?\n\n       Lao's men laugh and assume that Indy doesn't understand his joke.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Wah hung how, nee nah?

Lao is fifty, wealthy enough to now display some\n       fat, but still muscular from his fight to the top of the garbage\n       heap.\n\n                                   LAO\n                       For this special occasion, I\n                       ordered champagne and caviar.\n\n       Indiana looks at the pile of caviar on the plate in front of him\n       -- and stubs his cigarette out in it.  The cigarette sizzles and\n       Lao's smiles dies with it.\n\n       There's applause as Wille Scott finishes her song.  At the\n       table, Lao stares at Indiana with a strange intensity.\n\n                                   LAO\n                       So, it is true, Dr. Jones?  you\n                       found Nurhachi?\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Sure, I found him.  Then last\n                       night I had a little trouble.\n                       Somebody tried to slit my throat.\n\n       Indiana looks across the table at Lao's son, CHEN, who resembles\n       a bulldog and snarls like one now.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       It was dark, but I think one of\n                       your sons tried to get Nurhachi\n                       without paying for him.\n\n       Indy stares pointedly at Chen's recently bandaged hand.  Chen\n       mutters and stands angrily -- Lao barks a command in Chinese and\n       Chen sits down again.\n\n                                   LAO\n                       You have insulted my son.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Next time I'll cut off more than\n                       his finger.\n\n                                   LAO\n                       Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.\n\n       Lao pulls a wad of cash out of his pocket and puts it on the\n       table.  Indiana glances at it.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       As I recall the deal was consid-\n                       erably more.\n\n       Now a pretty hand slips onto Lao's shoulder and he looks up to\n       see Willie Scott.  Lao kisses her hand.  Willie is unaware of the\n       explosive mood at the table and she smiles flirtaciously at Indi-\n       ana.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                                   (to Lao)\n                       Aren't you going to introduce\n                       us?\n\n                                   LAO\n                       This is Willie Scott.\n                             (watching Indy)\n                       And this is Indiana Jones, the\n                       famous archaeologist.\n\n       Willie sits down between Lao and Indy.  She takes out a small\n       mirror to check her make-up.\n\n                                   LAO (Cont'd)\n                       Dr. Jones found Nurhachi for me\n                       and is about to deliver him --\n                       now.\n\n       Lao nods across the table and Indy sees KAO KAN, Lao's second\n       son, open his coat and remove a silver-plated pistol.  Indiana\n       looks worried.  Willie doesn't notice as she fixes her make-up\n       and coyly teases Indiana.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Well -- I thought archaeologists\n                       were always funny little men\n                       searching for their mummies --\n                                  (yelping)\n                       Aaahhh!\n\n       She looks down terrified at the knife Indy is poking against her\n       ribs.\n\n                                   WILLE (Cont'd)\n                       I was only kidding, can't you\n                       take a joke -- ?\n                                  (to Lao)\n                       Lao, he's got a knife!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Put the gun away, sonny.\n\n       Kao Kan glances at his father.  Lao finally nods to his son and\n       he slips the pistol back into his pocket.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Now I suggest you pay me what you\n                       promised -- or your girlfriend\n                       here is going to be squealing a\n                       new tune.\n\n       The ritzy patrons at the tables nearby are unaware of the tawdry\n       drama quietly unfolding at this table.\n\n       Willie eyes the blade and whimpers.  She looks imploringly at Lao\n       and he slowly reaches into his pocket.  He puts ten gold coins\n       next to the cash on the table.\n\n       Indy leans forward to look at the gold coins -- so intently that\n       he fails to notice Kao Kan spilling some powder into Indy's cham-\n       pagne glass!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Try again Lao -- the deal was\n                       more.\n\n       The knife pokes Willie and she whimpers again.  Lao reaches into\n       another pocket and brings out a folded piece of rice paper -- he\n       opens it and a large diamond and ruby spill out onto the table.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       Bingo...you see, Lao, with a\n                       but of persuasion, even you can\n                       be an honest fellow.\n\n       Indy smiles and jabs the knife into the middle of the table.\n       Then he lifts his champagne glass in a toast to Lao -- who\n       watches expectantly as Indiana moves the glass toward his lips --\n\n       Suddenly Willie stands angrily, jostling Indy's arm so that he\n       doesn't drink his champagne.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Look at this!  He put a hole\n                       in my dress from Paris!\n\n       Lao sees Indy put his champagne glass down and he snarls at Wil-\n       lie --\n\n                                   LAO\n                       Sit down!\n\n       Willie quickly obeys.  Lao forces a smile at Indy and lifts his\n       glass to seal the deal --\n\n                                   LAO (Cont'd)\n                       To your health, Dr. Jones.\n\n       Lao sips hs champagne and watches hopefully as Indy picks up his\n       glass and this time Indy does drink the champagne. Then he\n       reaches for the cash --\n\n       But Chen grins and puts a silver snuff bottle next to the cash,\n       gold and jewels -- he tips the little bottle over and some white\n       powder spills out of it --\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       What's that?\n\n                                   LAO\n                       A bonus, Dr. Jones.  That is\n                       poison.  You just drank the\n                       rest of it.\n\n       Indiana examines his champagne glass and sees a residue at the\n       bottom of it.  He swallows and feels sick, wondering it it's fear\n       or the poison already taking effect.\n\n                                   LAO (Cont'd)\n                       There is an antidote for this\n                       poison.  You give me Nurhachi --\n                       I give you the antidote.\n\n       Indiana is sweating.  Willie looks at him and sees Indy's hand\n       shaking.\n\n                                   LAO (Cont'd)\n                       The poison works fast, Dr. Jones.\n                       Where is Nurhachi?\n\n       Indiana finally reaches into his pocket.  Next to the cash, gold,\n       jewels and poison, Indiana sets down a beautiful small box.  Lao\n       and his men stare hypnotically at the exquisite gold and enamel\n       box.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                                (nervously)\n                       This Nurhachi's a very small guy.\n\n       Nobody pays any attention to her as Lao reaches for the box.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Inside are the remains of Nur-\n                       hachi -- the first Emperor of the\n                       Manchu Dynasty.\n\n       Lao opens the box carefully and stares reverently at the grey\n       powder inside.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       Now what about the antidote,\n                       Lao.\n\n                                   LAO\n                             (holding the box)\n                       At last I have the ashes of my\n                       sacred ancestor!\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       So, what's the big deal?  Let\n                       me see it --\n\n       Qillie grabs Lao's arm and some of the precious ashes spill out\n       of the gold box.  Stunned by this desecration of his ancestor,\n       Lao grabs Willie by the wrist and twists her arm --\n\n                                   LAO\n                       You fool!\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Ow, you're hurting me, you miser-\n                       able little hood!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Let go of her, Lao.  And give me\n                       the antidote.\n\n       Lao just laughs evilly -- until a waiter moves up behind Lao and\n       the crimelord suddenly stiffens.  He lets go of Willie's wrist\n       and raises his hands off the table.  Chen stops collecting the\n       money and jewels.\n\n       Kao Kan tenses and Indy smiles at Wu Han, the Chinese waiter with\n       the scar, who is standing behind Lao.  Wu Han has a towel over\n       his hand  --  under it, he has a pistol pressed against Lao's\n       spine.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                              (smiling at Wu Han)\n                       I like the service here.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                                  (puzzled)\n                       Hey, he's not a waiter...\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       No, Wu Han's an old friend I\n                       brought along.\n                                   (to Lao)\n                       So, the game's not over. Put\n                       the antidote on the table, Lao.\n\n       Lao carefully reaches into his pocket and puts a small glass vial\n       of liquid next to the cash, gold, jewels, poison and sacred box.\n       Indy looks relieved as he reaches for the vial of antidote --\n       then he hears a muffled report!  And another!\n\n       Wu Han groans and sways.  Indy starts to stand but Chen immedi-\n       ately turns the smoking pistol with the silencer that he used to\n       kill Wu Han -- Indy sees it pointed at him now and he remains in\n       his seat.\n\n       Kao Kan stands and grabs Wu Han, easing the phoney waiter into\n       the chair he just vacated.  The muffled shooting hasn't attracted\n       any attention.  The nightclub activity continues an Indy speaks\n       emotionally to his dying friend.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Wu Han  --  listen to me  --  I'm\n                       going to get you out of here.\n\n       In pain, Wu Han looks at Indy and struggles to speak --\n\n                                   WU HAN\n                       Not this time, my friend...\n                             (smiling bravely)\n                       I followed you on many adventures --\n                       but into the great Unknown Mystery,\n                       I go first, Indy...\n\n       Wu Han dies and slumps forward.  Indiana is shattered by the\n       death of his old friend.\n\n                                   LAO\n                       Don't be sad, Dr. Jones -- you\n                       will soon join him.\n\n       Indy's gaze shifts from his dead friend to Lao's sneering face.\n       Then Indy sees the murderous Chen giggling perversely.  Indy's\n       anger is compounded by the poison burning in his gut and his vis-\n       ion of Chen's ugly face blurs into a double image --\n\n       Indy stands up unsteadily.  Chen assumes he's about to keel over\n       from the poison -- but Indy suddenly turns and grabs a real wai-\n       ter at another table.  The waiter holds a long skewer of roasted\n       pigeons that he's just set afire --\n\n       Indy grabs the skewer of pigeons flambee and hurls is across the\n       table!  Chen fires and misses -- and screams as the skewer stabs\n       into his chest and the burning pigeons flame in front of his hor-\n       rified face!\n\n       This the other tables definitely notice.  There are screams and\n       all hell breaks loose.  Indiana shoves past Willie and reaches\n       for the vial on the table --\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       The antidote -- !\n\n       But he's grabbed from behind by Kao Kan.  Indy elbows the punk,\n       reaches back and grabs his head -- and somersaults Kao Kan onto\n       the table!\n\n       As nubmer two son crashes into the table, the impact sends the\n       Emperor Nurhachi's ashes billowing into Lao's stricken face!\n\n       Indiana yells as he sees the vial of antidote rolling across the\n       table -- and falling!\n\n       Indiana dives and catches the antidote just before it hits the\n       floor -- then Indy's hand is brutally stomped on by one of Lao's\n       henchmen and the vial rolls away.\n\n       Indiana angrily raises his head, smashing it up into the hench-\n       man's groin -- the man howls like a banshee and hobbles away.\n       \n       Meanwhile, Willie watches Lao grabbing for cash from the table.\n       Willie lunges past the pigeon-skewered Chen to snatch the jewels,\n       but unfortunately Kao Kan knocks them off the table as he leaps\n       to attack Indy.\n\n       Indiana scrambles on his hands and knees after the rolling vial.\n       People keep kicking it -- he almost has it when Willie runs into\n       him, trips and lands on her back.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Look out, damn it, I need that\n                       antidote!\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Who cares?  Where's that diamond!\n\n       Gunfire explodes and they both scramble in different directions.\n       Indy dives through the fleeing nightclub patrons and slides be-\n       hind a water-spewing fountain.  Water kicks up as Indy is shot at\n       by Lao and his henchmen.\n\n       Indy sees the vial of antidote kicked again and it spins across\n       the marble floor -- feeling the poison, Indy shakes his head\n       groddily and splashes water on his face.\n\n       Meanwhile, Willie is chasing her diamond, shoving through the\n       panicked crowd.  She spots the diamond!  Another elegantly\n       dresses soman is bending to pick it up --\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                              (acidly polite)\n                       Excuse me, but I believe that's\n                       my diamond!\n\n       Willie smiles and suddenly kicks the woman in the butt!  Willie\n       reaches to get the diamond but not before the other woman tackles\n       her.\n\n       Behind the fountain, Indiana makes a break -- he runs and dives\n       on top of a serving cart.  The wheeled cart hurtles toward an un-\n       suspecting gunman, crashes into him from behind and sends him\n       flying head first into a row of ice buckets.\n\n       Nearby, Willie slugs the other lady in the jaw and grabs for the\n       elusive diamond just as the ice buckets showers ice across the\n       floor -- which camouflages the diamond!\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Aw nuts!\n\n       Searching desperately for the jewel, Willie sees the vial of\n       antidote spinning across the floor --as it slides by, she grabs\n       it.\n\n                                   INDIANA (O.S.)\n                       Hey,doll!  Don't move!\n\n       She sees Indy speeding by atop the serving cart.  Lao and his\n       gunmen rush out to block the way.  Indy rolls off the cart and\n       slides behind a potted palm as Lao's men open fire again.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                           (shouting to Willie)\n                       Hey, don't go away!

Indy makes a break for it.\n\n       As the gunmen open fire, Indy springs onto a chair -- jumps onto\n       a table -- and leaps onto the stage.  He grabs the golden broad-\n       sword from the Chinese warrior statue!\n\n       As bullets smash into the statue, Indiana hides behind it.  Then\n       he jumps out and swings the large sword toward the enormous brass\n       gong.\n\n       The crimson cord holding the gong is SLASHED!  Indy slings the\n       sword at his assailants and gives the three-meter-high gong a\n       helpful shove --\n\n       The giant gong rolls and echoes as it crashes down the marble\n       steps.  Indiana ducks behind it as it gains momentum and rolls\n       across the dance floor.\n\n       Using the gong as an enormous shield, Indy evades the gunfire ex-\n       ploding -- bullets ricochet off the rolling brass gong as Indy\n       runs behind it.\n\n       Ahead, Willie hurries toward an exit -- she hears something and\n       turns -- her eyes go wide as she sees the mammoth gong bearing\n       down on her!\n\n       Willie yells as Indiana grabs her arm and pulls her behind the\n       gong with him --\n\n       Lao watches amazed as he and his gunmen dodge tables trying to\n       get better firing positions -- and more henchmen come into the\n       club now and start firing machine guns!\n\n       As bullets clang against the gong, Indiana and Willie run behind\n       it.  Willie hollers as they head directly for a towering, floor-\n       to-ceiling window!\n\n       Indiana grabs Willie around the waist and, after the huge gong\n       crashes through the stained-glass window, they both fly after it!\n\n6.

The\n       three helpless passengers are drenched in the thundering cascades\n       of white water.\n\n       Willie is hallering, Short Round hangs on wide-eyed and even Indy\n       looks terrified as the raft crashes down the rapids.  Finally,\n       after one heart-stopping bounce, the raft seems to slow.\n\n36.    EXT.

Its three soaked and bedraggled passengers lie\n       motionless in the bottom.\n\n       Indy's hand drags alongside the raft, his fingers leaving a trail\n       in the almost still water.  Battered and exhausted, but always\n       Indy's \"bodyguard\", Shorty looks over at him worriedly --\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Indy?\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Okay, Shorty.\n\n       Indy looks over at Willie who is moaning.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       You all right?\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       No...

Silhoutted against the blazing sun, the skin-\n       ny little old man in a loincoloth stares down at them in the raft.\n\n       An eerie wind rises and howls.  The old man places his palms to-\n       gether and moves his hands up to touch his forehead.  Willie and\n       Short Round watch mystified as Indiana returns the old shaman's\n       silent greeting.\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n37.    EXT.

A desolate road runs\n       through the village, along which groups of ptiifully poor vil-\n       lagers stare at the strangers being brought in.\n\n       Hopeless women lift buckets from a dry well -- finding only sand.\n       Skinny miserable dogs skulk between the decrepit village huts,\n       eyed by the patient vultures lurling in scraggly trees.\n\n       Indiana notices the wretched peasants staring at Short Round,\n       some of them pointing at him, a few haggard women shedding tears\n       down their wrinkled faces as the little Chinese boy passes.\n\n       There is no sign of children in the village and Short Round grows\n       frightened by the odd attention.

A grey-haired man, the village\n       CHIEFTAIN, gives quiet commands to the women who scuttle in and\n       set wooden plates in front of the three visitors.

We hear heavy breathing\n       -- above we see the scraggly trees blowing against the full moon\n       as an eerie wind rises and howls.

She\n       SCREAMS as the boa constrictor falls off the t-ee on top of her!\n\n       Indy hears the scream and hears Willie calling to him.  He runs\n       back toward the river.  Stopping on the riverbank, he sees Willie\n       backing away in the water -- Indiana's already starting to pull\n       his boots off --\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Indy!

He leaves his boots on.\n\n                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)\n                       Hurry, help me out of here!\n                       What're you waiting for?!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a\n                       better idea.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       What?!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       First of all -- don't panic!\n\n       Willie suddenly screams as the boa constrictor wraps around her\n       arm --\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       It's got me !  Indy, help me!\n\n       Indy runs along the riverbank, trying to get closer to her, but\n       not about to jump into the river (due to his aversion to snakes\n       -- see Episode One:  \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\").\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Don't let it pull you deeper!\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       It's pulling me deeper!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Don't let it curl around you!\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       It's curling around me!  Damn it,\n                       stop talking and do something!\n\n       The snake is wrapping around her body and neck -- her head is\n       barely above water --\n\n       On the riverbank, Indy reaches down and grabs a piece of wood.\n       But as he watches the repulsive reptile, he starts to sweat and\n       his fear and loathing overpower him --\n\n                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)\n                       What's wrong?!

He sees the snake starting to drift away\n       from Willie and she starts paddling back to shore, collecting her\n       floating clothes along the way.\n\n       Holding her dripping dress against herself, she walks out of the\n       water toward Indy who smiles at her weakly.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       See -- I got you out...\n\n       She slows and hauls off and punches him in the mouth.

It was one\n                       of those bats!\n                                   (staring into\n                                    the darkness)\n                       God, what else is out there...?!\n\n       She quickly picks up her blanket and lays it out very close to\n       Indy.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Couldn't keep away, huh?\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Just try and control yourself.\n\n       Indiana watches her lie down and wrap herself in her blanket.\n       then he rolls over and tips his hat down over his eyes to get\n       some well-deserved shut-eye.\n\n       In a moment, however, we see something grotesque and snake-like\n       slide into frame and move towards Indy -- finally, we realize\n       it's an elephant's trunk.  The trunk nudges Indy's shoulder.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                              (without looking)\n                       Still scared?  Okay, Willie, you\n                       can get closer if you want...\n\n       The elephant's trunk moves closer and nuzzles Indy's neck.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Honey, I knew you'd be the first\n                       one to give in...\n\n       Now, we see that Short Round is guiding the baby elephant's trunk\n       with a prod.  Willie watches, stifling a laugh as the elephant's\n       trunk sniffs Indiana's ear --\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       You're going to start something\n                       I'm going to have to finish.\n                                  (moaning)\n                       Okay, doll, you asked for it.\n\n       Indiana rolls over, lifts his hat and hollers!  He nearly jumps\n       out of his pants as he stares into the elephant's trunk.  Willie\n       and Short Round dissolve into laughter.\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n54.    EXT.  THE JUNGLE - DAY                                         54.\n\n       Tall, vine-covered trees sway in the wind.  Beneath them, the el-\n       ephants plough through the dense tropical forest.  The sounds of\n       the teeming jungle multiply as Short Round surveys the distant\n       hills.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Indy, look!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       That's it.

He barks commands and the elephants stop.  Indiana\n       jumps down an joins the fearful guide.\n\n       They stare at a small statue of a malevolent goddess with eight\n       arms.  Around the goddess's neck, a carved necklace displays\n       small human heads -- her eight hands hold other heads by their\n       hair.\n\n       Indiana moves closer to the statue as the terrified guide backs\n       away.  Indy is fascinated by the ritual objects adorning it:\n       leaves, dead birds, rodents and turtles.  Indiana grimaces as he\n       lifts a necklace of real pierced human fingers...\n\n                                   WILLIE (O.S.)\n                       Why are we stopping here?\n\n       Indiana goes back and joins the scared, jabbering guide who is\n       helping Willie down from the elephant.  Short Round jumps down.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       What you look at, Indy?\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Just a statue.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       What's the guide talking about?\n                       He hasn't said a word the whole\n                       trip.\n\n       Indy listens to the agitated guide and then speaks a few words in\n       Hindi back to him.  They watch the distressed guide trun the ele-\n       phants and start away with them as fast as possible.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       He's afraid of something.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       He said he couldn't take us any\n                       farther.

Short Round watches the elephants\n       trudging away.  The little elephant turns and looks back.  Short\n       Round quickly wipes a tear from his face.\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n56.    EXT.  A PALACE APPROACH - AFTERNOON                            56.\n\n       Indiana and Short Round hike up a rock-paved road beside a high\n       wall.  Exhausted, carrying her high heels, Willie trudges along\n       behind them.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       -- shot at, fallen out of a plane,\n                       nearly drowned, squashed by a snake,\n                       attacked by a bat -- I smell like\n                       an elephant!\n                                 (yelling)\n                       I tell you I'm not going to make it!\n\n       Indiana finally stops.  He walks back to Willie, suddenly picks\n       her us in his arms and starts carrying her the remaining way.\n       Willie is surprised and puzzled.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Any more complaints?\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                              (smiling faintly)\n                       Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this\n                       sooner...\n\n       She doesn't seem to mind being carried by Indy.  He arrives at\n       the entrance to the palace and puts her down -- she stands close\n       to him and he gently smoothes the collar of her dress.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       It doesn't feel like there's been\n                       any permanent damage.\n\n       She smiles at him again and then turns around -- and whistles as\n       she sees Pankot Palace:  a sprawling, monumental mixture of Mo-\n       ghul and Rajput styles, the palace is an extravaganza of Princely\n       architecture.\n\n57.

Lined along the bridge, palace guards stand with\n       lances.\n\n       As the threesome passes, the first Rajput guard snaps noisily to\n       attention and Willie jumps.  As Willie continues across the\n       bridge, the other guards snap to attention in sequence and she\n       grins, enjoying the attention.\n\n58.    INT.  THE OUTER COURTYARD                                      58.\n\n       Short Round and Willie follow Indiana through a dark archway into\n       a glittering courtyard.  The palace seems deserted and forebod-\n       ing.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Hello?...(hello?)...(hello?)\n\n       Indy's voice echoes off the marble facades -- three enormous Raj-\n       put guards with curved swords in their sashes appear silently at\n       opposite sides of the courtyard.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                               (frightened)\n                       Hi...(hi)...(hi)...\n\n       Then, a tall severe-looking Indian in an English suit material-\n       izes out of the shadows and comes forward slowly.  CHATTAR LAL\n       appraises the intruders suspiciously:\n\n       He sees a whoozy beauty in a weary evening gown;  a dirty Chinese\n       kid with a baseball cap; a rugged-looking American carrying a\n       bullwhip...\n\n                                   CHATTAR LAL\n                       I would say you look rather lost.\n                                  (disdainfullt)\n                       But then I cannot imagine where\n                       in the world the three of you\n                       would look at home...\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                                (smiling evenly)\n                       Lost?

Fountains spray in\n       ivory countyards and they gaze in awe at the ornate splendour.\n\n       As Willie walks with Shorty she appraises the chronolgoical\n       portraits of the Pankot Prices that line the hall.

Meanwhile, the little Maha-\n       rajah whispers to his Prime Minsiter.

Indy sees a servant lighting a candle.\n\n       Suddenly the whip flies and CRACKS like a pistol shot.  The\n       candle disappears!  Indiana whirls and CRACKS the whip again,\n       snagging a flower out of a dancing girl's hair.\n\n       The Maharajah reacts like any kid -- he shoops happily.\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH\n                       That is wonderful!

As the young prince practises the\n       grip, Indy notices Chattar Lal slip behind a fountain to talk to\n       a dark figure in robes who appears.\n\n       Indiana sees Chattar Lal bow to the dark figure -- and Indy\n       catches a glimpse of the stranger's pale face and dark hollow\n       eyes.  Then the robled apparition seems to disappear.\n\n       Meanwhile everyone watches respectfully as the Maharajah unfurls\n       the whip for his first attempt.  He flings the whip but it flies\n       back and snaps  -- biting his own  cheek.\n\n       There's a stunned silence -- then Short Round laughs  at the\n       little prince who is holding his wounded cheek.  The incensed Ma-\n       rahajah suddenly flashes the whip as Short Round.\n\n       Short Round grabs the end of it and pulls hard -- the whip is\n       tugged taut between the two hostile boys.  As they draw near each\n       other, Short Round sees something weird:\n\n       The little Maharajah's eyes begin glowing yelloe and he hisses\n       softly in a strange voice.  Nobody else sees or hears the bizarre\n       transformation...\n\n       Indiana finally intercedes -- he grabs Short Round by the neck.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Okay, Short Round, let go of it.\n\n       Short Round lets go and Indy gently takes the whip back from the\n       little prince.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       The Turks say that a whip can be\n                       an enemy even to its owner.

Short Round still\n       doesn't wake up.\n\n       Indiana rips the cord from around his neck and gasps for breath.\n       He sees the assassin pulling a knife.  Indiana dives as the knife\n       flies through the air and slams into the wall.\n\n       Indiana grabs his whip, rolls and lands on his feet.  As the ass-\n       assin tries to retreat, Indy unleashes his whip -- it CRACKS and\n       wraps around the killer's neck.\n\n       The big man struggles, pulling on the whip, trying to release it\n       from his throat -- and Indiana holds fast, watching the killer\n       gasping for air now as his face turns red.\n\n       Suddenly the assassin does a full-blown backward sommersault\n       which rips the whip out of Indy's hand.  The assassin has an in-\n       stant to grin victoriously --\n\n       Until he sees that the whip handle is arching toward the ceiling\n       where is gets caught on the revolving fan!  The surprised assass-\n       in it tugged upwards -- and the whip twists around the ceiling\n       fan like fishing-line around a fishing-reel--\n\n       And like a doomed flounder, the assassin is slowly reeled up and\n       dragged toward the ceiling, his toes lifting off the floor.\n       The assassin screams as he is hanged!  His legs twitch in\n       his death throes -- and below him, Short Round finally wakes up.\n\n       Always Indiana's protector, Shorty instictively leaps off the\n       couch and draws a small dagger --\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Don't worry, Indy!

A vaulting cathedral-like ceiling is supported by\n       rows of carved stone columns.\n\n       Balconies overlook the temple floor.  Pillared halls leading to\n       dark side chambers.

In her\n       hand, she holds a sword, in the second the severed head of a\n       giant.With her other hands she encourages her worshipers, who\n       are chanting louder and louder!\n\n       Kali's face is loathsome:  her earrings are two corpses.

The\n       silence is chilling as another robed figure appears out of the\n       some on the altar.\n\n       This is MOLA RAM, the High Priest of the Thugge cult.  Mola\n       Ram's red-rimmed eyes glare from the sunken sockets in his\n       sinister face.  Here is a man who looks as vile and diabolic\n       as the unholy goddess rising behind him.\n\n       Up in the wind tunnel, Indy stares down at the High Priest and\n       realizes that is was Mola Ram he saw conferring with Chattar Lal\n       in the palace garden.\n\n       As the drum booms three times more, Mola Ram lifts one arm\n       up from his emaciated body and suddenly there is a scream!\n\n       All heads turn toward an unfortunate, struggling Indian begin\n       dragged out by priests.  The man's face and body are wildly\n       painted.  He screams again as he's tied onto a square iron frame\n       laying atop a large flat stone.\n\n       Mola Ram steps forward to the stretched-out victim and the Indian\n       looks up into the High Priest's grotesque face --\n\n       Suddenly Mola Ram's hand shoots out toward the man's chest -- and\n       pierces it!  The High Priests hand sinks into the victim's\n       writing body and rips out his living heart!\n\n100.   INT.

Willie sees that Short\n       Round is in trouble.  She runs over, leaps onto the back of the\n       other guard and starts ripping his hair out.\n\n       Short Round picks up his fallen dagger.  The big guard lurches\n       backwards and smashes Willie into the rocky wall of the tunnel.\n       Willie falls to the floor.\n\n       Short Round approaches, holding the man at bay with his dagger.\n       Willie turns as the other guard, the one she kneed, crawls toward\n       her -- Willie scoops up some dirt and throws it.

Suddenly the floor gives\n       way and Indy slips!\n\n       The entire rim of the hole shears off and Indy topples with it\n       and plunges down into the mine toward the assembled guards who\n       scatter -- Indy yells as he falls and it echoes...\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n124.

He lifts\n       his hands and discovers that they are chained.  In the murky\n       light, he sees Short Round sitting in chains across the cell.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Indy -- you knocked out when you\n                       fall.  You okay?\n\n       Indiana nods groggily.  He sees a young slave worker in rags sit-\n       ting near Short Round.  Through the iron bars of the cell, Indy\n       sees the children slaving in the mine tunnels.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                              (indicating the kid)\n                       This is Nainsukh -- from the vil-\n                       lage.

Nainsukh cowers in the darkness at the back of the cell,\n       like a trapped animal awaiting the inevitable.\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n125.

They\n       are stopped at a door and shoved inside.\n\n126.   INT.  MOLA RAM'S CHAMBER                                       126.\n\n       Indiana and Short Round stumble into the chamber.  It is a terri-\n       fying gallery of occult yantras, ritualistic statues and grisly\n       icons of the evil Thuggee sect.\n\n       Grotesque statues of Kali's baleful minions line the walls.  In a\n       corner, there is another statue of Kali herself, draped with\n       flowers, necklaces of real human skills and slithering belts of\n       live snakes.\n\n       Fresh blood has been splashed over the statue and at its base are\n       the three Sankara Stones recovered from Indiana.  Mola Ram sits\n       in a yoga position near the statue of Kali.\n\n       Mola Ram opens his eyes and he sees Indiana and Short Round\n       standing in chains before him.\n\n                                   MOLA RAM\n                       You were caught trying to steal\n                       the Sankara Stones.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                                 (shrugging)\n                       Nobody's perfect.

They also search for\n                       the last two stones.  Soon we will\n                       have all five Sankara Stones and\n                       the Thuggees will be all powerful!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Nobody can say you don't have a\n                       vivid imagination.\n\n                                   MOLA RAM\n                       You do not believe me?  You will,\n                       Dr. Jones.  You will become a true\n                       believer.\n\n       The door opens and Mola Ram bows slightly as the little Maharajah\n       enters.  Indy looks surprised and Short Round tenses.\n\n                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)\n                       Your Highness will witness the\n                       thief's conversion.\n\n       Mola Ram nods and two guards grab Indy.  They drag him struggling\n       to a rock and chain him to it.  Short Round scuffles as he's\n       pulled aside to watch.\n\n       Remembering the High Priest's earlier open-heart surgery, Indi-\n       ana looks worried as Mola Ram approaches him --\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH\n                       You will not suffer.  I recently\n                       became of age and tasted the blood\n                       of Kali.\n\n       Now the young initiate comes forward and Indiana looks startled --\n       it's Nainsukh.  He is wearing robes and his eyes are glowing\n       strangely.  Nainsukh hands Mola Ram a hollow human skull full of\n       blood!\n\n       The guards hold Indiana's head back and force his mouth open.\n       Mola Ram tips the skull and blood spills out of its death-\n       grinning jaws and flows into Indiana's mouth.  Indy gags --\n\n       Suddenly he spits the blood, spraying Mola Ram and the little\n       Maharajah.  Looking at his blood-splattered clothes, the Mahara-\n       jah is furious.\n\n                                   MOLA RAM\n                       Hold him!\n\n       The little prince's eyes glow angrily and he hisses at Indy --\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH\n                       You will learn to obey because\n                       you are powerless!\n\n       The little Maharajah pulls a small krtya from his robes -- Indy\n       sees that the doll has been crudely fashioned to resemble him.\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)\n                       I control you now!\n\n       The Maharajah turns and sticks the doll into a flaming urn.  In-\n       diana suddenly cries out and twists in pain as he is burned!  The\n       little prince smiles evilly and puts the doll back into his\n       robes.\n\n       Then he goes over to where Indy's whip and bag have been laid.\n       He grabs the bullwhip.\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)\n                       You told me that a whip could be\n                       an enemy to its owner.  We shall\n                       see!  Turn him over!\n\n       As the guards turn Indy face down, they rip off his jacket and\n       chain his ahnds to the rock.  The Maharajah uncurls the whip -- he\n       notices Short Round smiling snidely --\n\n       Suddenly the Maharajah cracks the whip -- it lashes out and cuts\n       into Short Round's shoulder.  Blood appears and Short Round looks\n       stunned by the lash and by the fact the Marahajah knows who to\n       use the whip.\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)\n                       As Dr. Jones suggested, I have\n                       been practicing.\n\n       The little Maharajah whirls and lashes the whip again.  Indiana\n       jerks as the bullwhip rips through his shirt and tears open his\n       flesh.  The Maharajah lashes again and again -- blood spurts\n       across Indy's tattered shirt.\n\n       As the whipping continues- Short Round jumps as if he is also be-\n       ing beaten.  His eyes fill with tears as he watches Indy suffer.\n\n       Finally, the little Maharajah lets the whip fall limp.  As the\n       Maharajah approaches Indy, Short Round lunges as him angrily but\n       the guards restrain him.\n\n       Indiana groans as he's turned over.  Blood trickles from his\n       mouth and he stares up hatefully at Mola Ram.\n\n                                   MOLA RAM\n                       The British in India will be\n                       slaughtered.  Then we will over-\n                       run the Moslems and force their\n                       \"Allah\" to bow to Kali.\n\n       Mola Ram is once again given the human skull by a priest and he\n       lifts it toward Indy's face --\n\n                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)\n                       And then the Hebrew God will fall\n                       and finally the Christian God will\n                       be cast down and forgotten.\n\n       Indy's head is held back and Mola Ram spills the blood -- it\n       flows out of the mouth of the skull into Indy's mouth.\n\n                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)\n                       Soon Kali Ma will rule the world!\n\n       Indy's eyes look horrified as the blood flows from the skull down\n       his choking throat -- some of the blood spills and falls to the\n       floor --\n\n       We see the very earth trembling as the evil spreads -- a fissure\n       appears beneath Indy's feet and a small line of crimson lava\n       oozes out and smiles evilly across the floor...\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n127.

Suddenly the brids shriek and flap away --\n\n       Willie stumbles through the secret door and falls into the room.\n       Insects cover her and she shimpers as she knocks them off.

She flies down the moonlit corridors, past\n       the huge wall paintings.\n\n       She stops by a courtyard and calls out desperately, but there is\n       no one around.  She backs away down a hallway and then jumps --\n       seeing something in a mirror:  a face looms behind her and she\n       screams!\n\n       Willie whirls and sees Chattar Lal, the Prime Minister, approach-\n       ing her.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Oh my God, you scared me!

Dressed in a Rajput maiden's outfit, Willie has been jewel-\n       ed and draped with flowers -- a strange contrast as she struggles\n       desperately.\n\n                                   CHATTAR LAL\n                       Your friend has seen and she has\n                       heard -- now she will not talk.\n\n       As Willie is dragged past she sees Indy and calls to him --\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Indy!

He looks around furtively\n       and sees a guard approaching.\n       \n       Short Round takes a chance -- he dives and rolls across the\n       tunnel.  He ducks behind a mine car full of rocks being pushed\n       out by two chained children.\n\n       The guard lumbers past unsuspectingly as Short Round makes his\n       escape using the moving mine car as cover.\n\n139.

He peers anxiously into a large carven and sees two\n       guards walking away.\n\n       When the coast is clear, Short Round darts across the cavern to a\n       long wooden ladder tilted up against a wall.  Short Round looks\n       up the high ladder and sees a kid with a sack of rocks descending\n       from a burrow-hole half-way up the wall.\n\n       The exhausted kid nearly collapses at the bottom -- then jumps\n       seeing Short Round.  Shorty motions for him to keep quiet.\n       Amaxed, the kid watches Short Round scramble up the ladder.\n       Shorty continues until he is high above the floor.\n\n       Dirty faces stare out of the high burrow as Short Round stops\n       climbing.  The kids are astonished as Short Round suddenly grunts\n       and kicks the ladder away from the wall!\n\n       The high ladder falls in an arc and what seem like sure suicide\n       slowly resembles a mini-Indiana Junes stunt as Short Round swings\n       to the other side of the falling ladder --\n\n       Short Round holds on for dear life as the ladder crashes against\n       the opposite cavern wall -- giving Short Round access to the\n       roof-hole that leads up to the temple!\n\n       Short Round scurries up the ladder and pulls himself up into the\n       chamber behind the altar.  He looks at the light flaring around\n       the statue of Kali --\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Indy -- !\n\n141.   INT.

Stretched out on it, Willie looks horrified\n       as she hangs suspended face down above the boiling lava!\n\n       The frame and victim descend slowly into the crevasse and the\n       crowd around the little Maharajah changs louder.\n\n142.

He\n       peers out and sees Willie disappearing into the crewasse!

He eludes the\n       first priest, smashes the second in the stomach with his head,\n       and runs like a little quarterback toward the fiery torch --\n\n       Short Round snatches the torch from the wall and charges toward\n       Indiana.  Seeing him coming, Indy's eyes start glowing yellow and\n       when Short Round runs up to him, Indiana suddenly swings and\n       backhands the little guy brutally across the face!\n\n       The torch flies out of Shorty's hand as he's knocked against at\n       wall by Indy's vicious blow -- Short Round wipes a little blood\n       from his chin and stares at his hero in wounded disbelief.\n\n       Chattar Lal watches approvingly -- a priest moves toward Shorty.\n       Chattar Lal looks back toward the crevasse --\n\n       Willie hangs on the lowering frame, heat waves rising up now to\n       scald her skin and she chokes as the sulphuric air burns her\n       lungs!\n\n       Meanwhile Short Round is crawling backwards across the floor with\n       a look of terror on his face -- Indiana stalks him, hissing,\n       snarling, his eyes lgowing --\n\n       Short Round springs to his feet and tries to run -- Indy grabs\n       him and pulls him -- Shorty's hand grabs for another wall torch\n       and just manages to yank it free!\n\n       Indiana spins Short Round and clutches his throat.  As Indy\n       strangles him, Short Round struggles and finally jams the torch\n       into Indy's side.  The fiery torch burns Indy, smoking as it\n       sears his flesh, and he yells in pain.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Wake up!  It's just a nightmare,\n                       Indy!  Wake up, please Indy!\n\n       Indiana writhes in pain and Short Round sees the evil yellow glow\n       in Indy's eyes getting dimmer and finally going out.  Now it\n       seems like theold Indiana staring at him --\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)\n                       Indy, you back?\n\n       Suddenly a priest grabs Short Round and pulls him off Indiana.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       No!

Shorty looks down at the lava and is terrified.\n       Indiana finally flahses him a quick smile and winks!\n\n       Then Indiana whirls and punches the priest in the face!  Short\n       Round cheers, realizing that Indiana is back.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)\n                       We got to help Willie!\n\n       Indiana springs into action, stopping another priest with a quick\n       punch in the stomach.  Then he rushes over to the crankwheel and\n       pulley platform.  Indy jumps onto it, yanking one priest off who\n       spills onto the floor.\n\n       A second priest, who works the controls lowering the sacrificial\n       frame, sees Indy and releases the crankwheel --\n\n       Down in the crevasse, Willie screams as the iron frame suddenly\n       plummets toward the fulminating lava!\n\n       On the platform, the priest lunges at Indiana -- Indy uses the\n       man's own momentum to throw him over his head.  Indy then dives\n       for the crankwheel and manages to stop it --\n\n       Down in the crevasse, the fram jolts to a stop only yards above\n       the spumes of fiery lava.  The heat is so intense now that Wil-\n       lie's clothes start smoking and she passes out...\n       On the platform above, Indiana cranks furiously, raising the sa-\n       crificial frame.\n\n144.

Short Round dives and tackles the\n       priest.\n\n       Chattar Lal finally leaps onto the crankwheel platform and Indy\n       sees him pull a dagger.  He slashes at Indiana and Indy has to\n       let go of the crankwheel -- the gears scream and the chains\n       screech!\n\n       Below in the crevasse, the iron frame plunges again toward the\n       crimson lava!\n\n       On the platform, Indy hears the frame lowering and looks pan-\n       icked.  Chattar Lal slahses again with the dagger -- keeping Indy\n       away from the cogwheel mechanism --\n\n       Indy suddenly kicks the dagger from Chattar Lal's hand slugs him\n       in the stomach and dives toward the cogwheel mechanism.  He grabs\n       a iron rod and throws it into the gears --\n\n       the gears mangle the iron rod but finally grind to a stop.  Indi-\n       ana grabs the crankwheel and starts winding it up furiously.\n\n       Meanwhile, Short Round jumps onto the platform with Indy and\n       grabs a long wrench.  He starts swinging the wrench, keeping the\n       last priests off the platfrom.\n\n       The sacrificial frame finally rises up into view and Indiana\n       grabs it and swings it over onto the platform.  He looks at Wil-\n       lie anxiously as he releases her bindings --\n\n       Willie moans and moves her head.  Indy pulls her off the frame\n       and she starts coughing.  Gasping for breath, Willie ervives as\n       fresh air flows into her lungs.\n\n       Finally Willie opens her eyes and she sees Indiana.  Then she\n       notices something else and manages to cry out hoarsely --\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Look out -- !\n\n       Chattar Lal grabs a pistol from an unconscious guard and Indiana\n       whirls to see him pointing it -- Indy kicks the gun from his hand\n       and suddenly Chattar Lal starts shouting in a terrifying voice --\n\n       Chattar Lal's eyes glow as he lunges suicidally at Indiana, at-\n       tempting to take Indy with him as he dives from the platform!\n\n       Crashing into Indy, Chattar Lal knocks both of them back onto the\n       sacrificial frame which swings out over the crevasse --\n\n       Indy manages to dive off the frame just in time.  He grabs hold\n       of the platform as the crankwheel screams and the frame falls!\n\n       Looking up from the depths of the crevasse, we see the frame with\n       Chattar Lal on it plummeting downward into the sulphurous smoke!\n       The frame finally crashes, splashing into the molten lava.\n\n       Chattar Lal's body explodes inot flame friefly -- his flesh is\n       broiled off in an instant -- we glimpse a skeleton momentarily --\n       and then all is consumed and obliterated by the blazing lava.\n\n      scramble over to Short Round who jumps off the platform and they\n       follow him across the altar.\n\n       Indy sees Mola Ram quickly collecting the sacred Sankara Stones.\n       Indiana rushes over and spins Mola Ram around --\n\n       He slugs the High Priest in the face and Mola Ram keels over\n       backwards against the statue of Kali.  Short Round helps stuff\n       the Sankara Stones into Indiana's shoulder bag.\n\n146.   INT.

THE ALTAR                                                154.\n\n       The childrens' bare feet stomp across the wooden plank -- below\n       them the lava of the fire pit bubbles and shows outbursts of\n       flame.\n\n       Indy stares at the plank and sees that it's starting to smoke\n       from the intese heat rising up.\n\n       On the far side of the plank, the children safely across scatter\n       through the deserted temple toward freedom.\n\n       Willie and Short Round help the last kids out onto the plank --\n       Indy sees one child's foot break though the smoldering wood --\n       the kid in front pulls the child to safety.\n\n       Willie and Short Round start to go out onto the plank but Indy\n       shouts at them --\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       No, wait!\n\n       He runs over and pulls them aside -- he steps out onto the plank\n       and takes a few steps to test it -- suddenly the plank bursts\n       into flame in the middle.\n\n       Indy takes one more step -- and then the plank breaks!  Indy\n       dives back to the ledge of the altar and Willie and Short Round\n       grab him and pull him up and the wooden plank plummets into the\n       fiery chasm.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       What're we going to do?!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       There's got to be another way out.\n\n                                                               CUT TO:\n\n155.   INT.  A TUNNEL                                                 155.\n\n       Indiana, Willie and Short Round run through the deserted mine\n       tunnels.  They hear a rumbling noise and Indy leads them down a\n       side tunnel.  They stop and peer into a quarry.\n\n156.   INT.  THE QUARRY CAVERN                                        156.\n\n       A large cavern is the depository for the mine cars rolling in\n       with loads of rock.  Emaciated children (still unaware of the re-\n       volt and the other childrens' escape) break their backs shoving\n       the heavily-loaded mine cars.\n\n       Thuggee guards supervise the deadening work, while others oper-\n       ate the pulley-and-hoist system used to drag  the cars up the\n       sloped dump ramp.\n\n       Behind this operation, a thunderous waterfall cascades into a\n       huge cistern.  From there, chutes deply the rushing water to\n       power the large conveyor belt below it.\n\n       As the cars rise up the ramp, they tip and spill rocks onto the\n       conveyor belt which carries them toward an awesome stone cylinder\n       that rolls relentlessly , crushing the rocks into sand.\n\n       From the side tunnel, Indiana watches the noisy operation.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Those empty cars have got to go\n                       out of the mines.\n\n       Willie and Short Round watch the children push the empty mine\n       cars.  The cars gain momentum and roll away down two dark tun-\n       nels.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       Come on, let's see if we can\n                       catch a ride...\n\n       Tey duck out of the tunnel and run for cover behind a slag heap.\n       Loaded mine cars roaring down from the mines hurtle past them and\n       crash to a stop against the cars in front.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       Okay, Shorty -- go!\n\n       He pushes Short Round who darts out after a mine car roars past\n       and dodges across the tracks before the next one descends.  Indy\n       pushes Willie  into  position and holds her ready --\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       I can't!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Go!\n\n       After another car crashes past, Indy shoves her.  Willie runs out\n       -- her shoe gets stuck and she freezes in the tracks!  Willie\n       sees a rock-filled car blasting down out of a tunnel directly\n       toward her!\n\n       Indiana dives, knocking Willie safely to the ground on the other\n       side of the tracks -- the heavy car hurtles past and crashes into\n       the cars in front.\n\n       Indy pulls Willie behind a massive wooden post holding up the\n       dump ramp and they hide from a passing gaurd.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       We've got to get across to the\n                       empty cars.  Wait here until I\n                       signal you.\n\n       They watch him run and hurdle a pile of lumber, bound up three\n       steps and duck behind a tool shack on the platform.  Indy reaches\n       out and grabs one of the passing slave children.\n\n       They see Indy put his hand over the kid's mouth and whisper to\n       him.  He releases the kid who sneaks away, alerting the other\n       children who start making their escapes into side tunnels.\n\n       Now Indy motions to Short Rounds and Willie to follow.  As they\n       start to move out they freeze dead in their tracks and Indy\n       motions again angrily --\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Come on!\n\n       Willie and Short Round see a guard coming up the steps on the\n       other side of the platform.  As the man rises he gets taller and\n       taller -- until they see it's a Thuggee giant coming up behind\n       Indiana.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       Come one, what's wrong?\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Behind you!\n\n       Indiana turns and looks into the bare chest of the seven-foot\n       tall guard.  Indy has to look up to see the man's mean-looking\n       face.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       I see the problem...\n\n       Indiana suddenly punches the giant in the stomach -- the giant\n       does not flinch, he just belches rudely.\n\n       Indiana growls and winds up to take a killer swing -- he steps\n       back, cocks his arm -- and suddenly turns and runs away.\n\n       No dummy, Indy dashes over and picks up a piece of wood.  The\n       giant starts toward him.  Indy drops the wood and looks around\n       for a much larger piece of wood.\n\n       As the giant stalks toward him, Indiana raises the large piece of\n       lumber -- Indy suddenly groans, drops the wood and clutches his\n       stomach.  Willie and Short Round looks startled --\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       What happened?\n\n       Short Round shakes his head.  They see Indy recover from the\n       spasm as the giant rushes him.  Indy jumps aside, landing on a\n       loaded mine car that is passing by.\n\n       The car is being dragged up the dump ramp and the giant jumps out\n       onto it after Indiana.  Indy quickly grabs a rock and, as the\n       giant rushes him, Indy smashes the rock against the big man's\n       skull!\n\n       Unfortunately, it's the rock that shatters and not the skull.\n       Indy dives to the other end of the mine car and lifts a large\n       boulder.\n\n       Suddenly Indy drops the boulder and grabs him arm, feeling a\n       shooting pain again.  Then he yells as he feels yet another stab-\n       bing pain in his left leg.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       What's wrong with him?\n\n       Shorty is convused and worried -- and then he sees something!  He\n       looks up and there on a rock-cut balcony over the cavern is the\n       little Maharajah!\n\n       The little prince clutches the clay krtya doll that represents\n       Indy.  He jabs it in the leg with a long sapphire-tipped turban\n       pin.\n\n       On the mine car, Indy yells and grabs his right leg, which\n       collapses beneath him.  Short Round takes off.  He dashes under\n       the platform toward a bucket-chain carrying spent water back up\n       to the cistern.\n\n       Short Round leaps over the pool of water and grabs onto a bucket.\n       He rises up on this make-shift elevator toward the rock balcony\n       and the malicious little Maharajah.\n\n       Meanwhile, Indy is on the brink of unconsciousness as the giant's\n       massive hands throttle his neck.  Indy's head hangs over the end\n       of the mine car and suddenly his eyes widen --\n\n       The car with Indy and the giant reaches the peak of the dump ramp\n       and its upended -- spilling both of them and a shower of rocks\n       down the conveyor belt!\n\n       Down below, Willie dodges wooden pillars and weaves around\n       quarry equipment, trying to follow Indy's battle with the giant.\n       She trips and swears angrily --\n\n       Willie pushes and empty mine car out of her way -- an empty mine\n       car!  She runs back and starts shoving the mine car along the\n       rails toward the conveyor belt.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       I got one!  Indy, I got one!\n\n       Near the waterfall, Short Round ascends on the rising bucket\n       chain.  Up on the balcony, the little Maharajah chuckles evilly as\n       he watches Indiana on the conveyor belt --\n\n       The Maharajah lifts the clay doll and viciously jabs the pin in\n       the back of it!\n\n       On te conveyor, Indiana gets to his feet and then yells as a\n       stabbing pain lacerates his back!  He falls and writhed helpless-\n       ly as the giant staggers up the rocky conveyor belt toward him.\n\n       Willie shoves the mine car forward.  She sees Indy's desperate\n       situation as he's pulled along the conveyor toward the rock\n       crusher!\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Indy, look out!\n\n       She looks up and sees Short Round leap from the bucket-chain onto\n       the balcony.  The little Maharajah's eyes glow fiendishly as he\n       lifts the clay doll -- and jabs the pin into the doll's face.\n\n       On the conveyor belt, Indy yells agonizingly and clutches his\n       stabbed face!  Behind him, rocks explode as they're crushed and\n       pulverized by the mammoth roller.\n\n       In front of Indy, the Thuggee giant grabs a pick-axe as the con-\n       veyor slides past a tool bin.  The giant approaches Indy with it.\n\n       Short Round dashes across the balcny and tackles the Maharajah.\n       They fall and fight like mortal enemies.  Short Round sees the\n       little Maharajah's eyes glowing as he punches him in the face.\n\n       Only a few feet away from the rock-smashing roller, Indy is still\n       on his back on the conveyor belt, thrashing in pain, feeling the\n       Maharajah's pin piercing his face.  The giant raises the pick-axe\n       above his head and it about to split Indiana in two!\n\n       On the balcony, the Maharajah drops the doll and Short Round\n       dives for it -- he grabs the clay doll and pulls out the pin!\n\n       On the conveyor belt, Indiana is suddenly released from the\n       and looks up to see the giant swinging the pick-axe.  Indy rolls\n       aside at the last minute!\n\n       The pick-axe cleaves into the conveyor belt and the giant lurches\n       forward -- Indy gives him a helpful kick, sending the giant\n       flying toward the rock-crusher as Indy jumps off the conveyor\n       belt!\n\n       Seeing the huge roller looming in front of him, the giant crawls\n       desperately against the movement of the conveyor belt -- but he\n       gets snagged!\n\n       The sash around his waist gets caught under the rolling cursher\n       and he's dragged back under it feet first.  The Thuggee giant\n       screams hideously as his body is rolled over and squashed by the\n       enormous stone wheel!\n\n       On the balcony, Short Round is jabbing the pin into the squirming\n       little Maharajah.  The little pricne's eyes still glow yellow as\n       he hollers --\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       How you like bing pin cushion,\n                       Mr. Rajah-ha-ha?\n\n       The little prince rolls on the ground and tries to fight off\n       Short Round who keeps jabbing him -- suddenly the Maharajah\n       swings and the pin is accidentally rammed clear through his hand!\n\n       Shorty sees the pin sticking through both sides of the kid's\n       hand.  The Maharajah stares at his pierced hand, gasping in\n       astonishment.\n\n       Short Round notices the yellow glow dying out of the Maharajah's\n       eyes -- just as Indy's eyes cleared after he was released from\n       Kali's trance.\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH\n                       Please -- pull it out!\n\n       Short Round yanks the pin out of the little prince's hand.  The\n       Maharajah looks like he's jsut awakened from a bag dream.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       It was the black sleep of Kali...\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH\n                       They made me do evil things...\n                       may lord Krishna forgive me.\n\n       Meanwhile, Indy runs along the catwalk above the conveyor belt.\n       He jumps and grabs onto a cross-bard -- he kicks out with his feet\n       and knocks a quarry guard off the catwalk.\n\n       The guard flies through the air and topples into the sand pit\n       where he thrashes around blindly under the sand falling from the\n       crusher.\n\n       Across the cavern, Willie shoves the rolling mine car toward the\n       balcony.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Get down here, Shorty!  I got us\n                       a ride!\n\n       Willie shirls as another quarry guard rushes toward her.  She\n       yanks the iron brake-handle off the mine car and holds it threat-\n       eningly like a baseball bat --\n\n                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)\n                       Come on, let's see hoe hand your\n                       head is!\n\n       Up on the rock balcony, Short Round lowers himself over the edge.\n       The little Maharajah grabs his arm --\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH\n                       Please -- listen -- to go out\n                       you must take the left tunnel.\n\n       Shorty looks at him and he knows he's telling the truth.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Thanks pal.\n\n                                   MAHARAJAH\n                       I'm going to try to find the\n                       English soldiers.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Good luck.\n\n       Short Round slips over the edge and slides down a wet stalactite\n       to the floor of the cavern.\n\n       There he finds Willie swinging the brake-handle and smashing the\n       guard in the gut.  The man doubles in pain -- Willie kicks his\n       putt and he splashes into the pool of water.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       I don't appreciate being cooked\n                       like a french fry!\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Willie, come on!\n\n       Willie starts pushing the empty mine car with Short Round.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)\n                       You do pretty good for a girl!\n\n       Across the quarry, Mola Ram and six temple guards run out onto a\n       high platform next to the waterfall.  Mola Ram sees Willie and\n       Short Round pushing the mine cat.\n\n       Mola Ram shouts to his men -- two of them pull pistols and open\n       fire!\n\n       Bullets ricochet off the mine car and Short Round shoves Willie\n       to the far side of the car where they both take cover.\n\n       Meanwhile, up on a catwalk, a guard slices a sword through the\n       air and Indiana ducks!  The sword slashes into a wooden railing\n       and the guard tries frantically to pull it out --\n\n       Indiana slams kis knee up into the guard's stomach and then\n       smashes his fist down on his neck -- the man collapses.  Indy\n       hears more gunfire.\n\n       Indiana rushes along the catwalk toward the platform above.  He\n       edges against the wall below the platform, staying out of sight\n       as he unfurls his whip.\n\n       One of Mola Ram's guards fires again from the high platform and\n       Indiana lashes the whip -- the whip wraps around the gunman's\n       arm and Indy yanks on it --\n\n       The gunman topples through the air and crashes down onto the cat-\n       walk.  Indy grabs the gun.  He kicks the guard off the catwalk\n       and the man falls into the waterfall pool.\n\n       As the other guards fire down at him, Indiana dodges along the\n       catwalk and fires back at them.  A bullet explodes near Mola Ram\n       and he ducks back --\n\n       Meanwhile, Short Round and Willie have the mine car rolling and\n       they jump into it --\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Indy!  Hurry!\n\n       Indiana spots the rolling mine car racing across the quarry.  Indy\n       takes off and runs along the catwalk -- bullets explode around\n       him, splintering wood.  Indy reaches the end of the catwalk --\n\n       Suddenly he dives into the air and catches hold of a block and\n       tacke!

Another guard with a Khyber rifle moves up to the\n       front and starts firing.\n\n       Meanwhile, as the car goes into a hard turn, Short Round rides\n       the brake -- beneath the car we see the brake-pad scraping on the\n       metal wheel.\n\n       The tunnel gets lower and Indy has to duck under each beam flying\n       over and can only pop up to fire between the low beams.\n\n       The rifleman in the car behind is relading.

Climb up\n                       to the bridge!\n\n       Willie looks frightened.\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Nothing to it -- follow me!\n\n       He edges along the narrow ledge toward the bridge and Willie\n       follows him.  Once under the bridge, they start climbing up the\n       rocks to it.\n\n       Meanwhile, Indiana is scaling the cliff face to get over the\n       water geyser to the other side.  He grabs at scrub brush and\n       finds a few perilous footholds as he makes his way to the bridge.\n\n172.   EXT.  THE ROPE BRIDGE                                          172.\n\n       Willie and Short Round pull themselves up at the end of the\n       bridge.  Behind them a dark tunnel runs back into the mines.\n       What's in front of them is hardly more reassuring --\n\n       The rope bridge across the gorge is a century old and defintely\n       wasn't built by army engineers.  Laying across the two bottom\n       rope-spans, worm-eaten and moldy boards offer risky footings.\n\n       Vertical side ropes connect the bottom rope-spans to the two up-\n       per ropes that constitute the dangerous hand-railings.\n\n       Short Round steps tentatively out onto the bridge.  It holds him\n       and he turns and smiles at Willie --\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Easy like pie!  Kid's stuff!\n\n       Suddenly the board under him breaks! Willie grabs Short Round\n       before he falls into the abyss!  Looking pale and less cocky,\n       Short Round starts out again and Willie follows his carefully.\n\n       They continue stepping across the bridge cautiously, a feat made\n       more difficult by the bridge's constant swaying and the hear-\n       stopping up and down movement.\n\n       Behind them, Indy finally pulls himself up from under the bridge.\n       He stands up and sees Willie and Short Round halfway across\n       already.  Then he hears something and turns quickly -- he takes\n       his whip out and ducks to the side of the tunnel as two Thuggee\n       guards rush out.\n\n       Indy cracks the whip, catching the first guard around the neck --\n       the guard spills forward and trips the second guard.  The first\n       man tries to stand but Indiana kicks him in the head.\n\n       The second guard gets to his feet and seings his sword -- Indy\n       ducks, slams him in the stomach and dives for the first guard's\n       sword.  He grabs it and rolls aside quickly as the second gaurd\n       attempts to slice him in two!\n\n       Indy gets to his feet and immediately finds himself about to en-\n       gage in a sword duel with the enraged Thuggee guard.  Indy looks\n       at the unfamiliar sword, hefts it, and tries to quickly decide\n       the best way to use it --\n\n       Suddenly the guard shouts and charges.  Indy decides shouting\n       must be the \"de rigueur\" technique and shouts back loudly -- the\n       two swords CLANG and spark as the duel erupts.\n\n       Indy flails and feints and the Thuggee guard lunges and slashes.\n       Indy finally gains the upper hand and dispatches the Thuggee\n       guard who slumps defeated into the dirt.\n\n       Keeping the sword, Indy starts out onto the bridge, walking as\n       quickly as possible across the rickety span.  He hears shouting\n       ahead and looks worried then temple guards appear at the far end\n       of the bridge.\n\n       The guards suprise Willie and Shorty as they finally get across\n       the bridge.  Struggling   futilely with the guards, Willie shouts\n       at Indiana --\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       Indy -- looks out behind you!\n\n       Indy sees more Thuggee guards rushing out of the tunnel behind\n       him.  He turns and sees two of the tmeple guards who captured\n       Willie and Short Round coming across the bridge in front of him.\n\n       Indy stands helpless in the middle of the swaying bridge with\n       guards approaching from both sides, and nothing but heaven above\n       and the rocky gorge hundreds of feet below!\n\n       A wind comes up and the High Priest, Mola Ram, appears on the far\n       end of the bridge.  He stands with the guards who hold Willie and\n       Short Round.\n\n       The wind whips around Indy and he staggers unsteadily on the\n       swaying bridge as he watches Mola Ram --\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Let my friends go!\n\n       Mola Ram shouts in Hindi and the guards start to move toward Indy\n       from both sides of the bridge.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       That's far enough!\n\n                                   MOLA RAM\n                       You are in no position to give\n                       orders, Dr. Jones.\n\n       Indiana indicates the bag over his shoulder --\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       You want the stones, let them go\n                       and call off your guards!\n\n       Mola Ram motions and the guards move farther out on both sides of\n       the bridge -- suddenly Indiana swings the sword and it cuts into\n       one of the bottom rope-spans!\n\n       The rope is half-severed and frays slowly under the tension!\n\n                                   MOLA RAM\n                       Impressive, Dr. Jones. But I\n                       don't believe you would kill\n                       yourself!\n\n       Mola Ram motions again the his guards (looking more nervous now)\n       step farther out onto the bridge, mvoing closer to Indy from both\n       sides.\n\n       Indy swings the sword again, cutting into the other rope-span!\n       It, too, is now partially severed and frays slowly.  The bridge\n       jolts and Indy and the guards sway precariously!\n\n       Suddenly Mola Ram shoves Short Round out onto the bridge.  The\n       High Priest draws a dagger and pushes Willie onto the swaying\n       span, holding the knife behind them both.\n\n                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)\n                       Your friends will die with you!\n\n       In different times this would be called a Mexican stand-off\n       Indiana looks at the guards in front and behind him.  He sees\n       Willie and Short Round out on the bridge now with Mola Ram at\n       their backs.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Then I guess we're all going to\n                       take a big dive!\n\n       Indy and Short Round's eyes meet -- and the kid realizes that his\n       hero isn't kidding.  Willie looks at Shout Round anxiously -- she\n       notices that Shorty is surreptitiously wrapping his foot around a\n       rope support.\n\n       Petrified, Willie also secretly wraps her foot around a rope and\n       does likewise with her arm --\n\n                                   MOLA RAM\n                       Give me the stones!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Mola Ram -- you're about to meet\n                       Kali -- in Hell!\n\n       Indiana swings the sword with all his might -- it whooshes\n       through the air and slashes clear through the top and bottom\n       ropes --!\n\n       Immediately Mola Ram's guards start to flee in panic -- too late!\n       Indiana swings the sword again and the two ropes on the other\n       side are severed --\n\n       The rope bridge is sheared in two!  It breaks in the middle and\n       both halves fall apart!  The guards scream horribly in the air as\n       they plunge down into the rocky gorge!\n\n       Willie and Short Round cling to their established footholds and\n       fall with the bridge toward the wall of the gorge.  Mola Ram\n       spills forward, clutching desperately at the ropes and slats --\n\n       Below them, Indiana has latched onto a rope and swings with the\n       bridge as it hits the gorge wall and hangs vertically now, dang-\n       ling from its moorings at the top.\n\n       There's an instant of suspended animation as all who remain alive\n       realize they are alive.  Short Round and Willie cling near the\n       top of the now vertical bridge.\n\n       Below them, Mola Ram clutches onto one of the main ropes while\n       directly above him the last of his guards holds on for dear life.\n\n       Short Round and Willie struggle upwards, clutching ropes and\n       stepping on slats.  Finally, Short Round heaves himself up onto\n       solid ground and turns to help Willie up.\n\n       Meanwhile, dangling below on the bridge, Indy reaches up and\n       grabs Mola Ram's leg.  The High Priest kicks and tries to break\n       Indy's grip.  He kicks again and smashes Indy in the face.\n\n       Indy won't let go.  Suddenly the High Priest reaches up and grabs\n       his own Thuggee guard and yanks his down by the front of his\n       shirt --\n\n       Mola Ram shoves the luckless guard down onto Indy, trying to\n       dislodge him by sacrificing the screaming Thuggee.  Indy manages\n       to hang on.  The Thuggee is less fortunate and falls screaming to\n       his death.\n\n       Then Mola Ram looks across the gorge and yells.  Indy sees a dozen\n       of the last Thuggee guards streaming out of the tunnel -- only\n       to be stranded on the far side of the now bridgeless gorge.\n\n       Indy starts climbing up after Mola Ram again.  He grabs at the\n       back of Mola Ram's robe and pull him down.  Slipping, Mola Ram\n       turns and it's Indy's chance to punch Mola Ram in the face.\n\n       Mola Ram's eyes are glowing yellow and he's shouting incoherent-\n       ly.  He grabs the strap of Indy's shoulder bag and stamps on In-\n       dy's hand -- Indy falls!\n\n       Indiana slips downward, scrambling to catch hols of something --\n       meanwhile, Mola Ram now has the bag with the Sankara Stones.\n\n       Indy finally stops his downward slide and dangles dangerously\n       near the bottom of the bridge.\n\n       Across the gorge, the Thuggee guards run up a path to a small\n       gove of trees growing on a plateau above the gorge.  The guards\n       have bows and arrows and take firing positions --\n\n       At the top of the bridge, Mola Ram keeps climbing until rocks\n       start poundinghim from above -- Willie and Short Round pely him\n       with rocks which he tries to block with his arm.\n\n       Indiana starts to climb again, using all his strength.  He\n       reaches for a wooden slat -- suddenly a flaming arrow smashes\n       into the wood!\n\n       Indy turns in amazement and sees more flaming arrows rocketing\n       across the chasm directy for him!\n\n       Across the gorge, by the grove of trees, a Thuggee priest yells\n       orders to the archers who continue to launch the flaming arrows.\n\n       Indiana crawls up as the bridge starts to burn from the continu-\n       ing bursts of fiery arrows.  At the top, Mola Ram reaches up des-\n       perately for a hand old -- Willie smashes his hand with a rock!\n\n       The High Priest yells in pain and slips down to where Indy slugs\n       him again in the face!  They struggle as the fire burns up from\n       beneath them.\n\n       On the cliff above the fallen bridge, Willie watches the fire\n       rising toward Indy and Mola Ram as they fight.  Short Round turns\n       and sees something --\n\n                                   SHORT ROUND\n                       Willie, look!\n\n       They see horses galloping through a narrow pass -- the British\n       cavalry is returning.  Captain Blumburtt and the first troops draw\n       up their forses and dismount quickly.\n\n       A fussilade of flaming arrows force the British to take cover --\n       they quickly start firing back at the Thuggees with rifles.\n\n       As the battle above the gorge continues, Indy and Mola Ram fight\n       below on the dangling bridge --\n\n       Indiana sees the High Priest's eyes begin glowing and he hisses\n       insanely.  Mola Ram's hand thrusts out toward Indiana's chest and\n       Indy yells in pain --\n\n       Indy looks down and writhes terrified as he sees Mola Ram's hand\n       starting to enter his chest (as it entered the victim's chest\n       during the temple sacrifice)!\n\n       Mola Ram's finger are inching into Indy's body --  Indy clutches\n       at Mola Ram's piercing hand, trying to keep the deadly fingers\n       away from his heart.\n\n       Slowly, Indy is able to push Mola Ram's hand away and his fingers\n       withdraw from Indy's chest.  Indiana suddenly slugs the High\n       Priest in the face and grabs for the bag of Sankara Stones --\n\n                                   MOLA RAM\n                       No, the stones are mine!\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       You're betrayed Shiva. *(He re-\n                       peats in Sanskrit Sankara's warn-\n                       ing)\n\n       As Indy pronounces the magical words, the bag begins glowing and\n       starts to burn Mola Ram as he clutches it -- the stones begin to\n       spill out of the bag and the High Priest grabs from them.\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       *(He repeats Sankara's warning\n                        in Sanskrit)\n\n       The blazing stones sear Mola Ram's flesh and he screams in pain.\n       The light suddenly dies in his eyes and for one instant he looks\n       at Indy as if awakened from a nightmare --\n\n       Mola Ram loses his balance and Indy grabs for the stones.  He\n       manages to clutch only one of them as Mola Ram screams and falls!\n\n       Indy sees the stone in his hand suddenly cool.  He watches Mola\n       Ram plummeting downward into the chasm and finally crashing into\n       the jagged rocks at the bottom.\n\n       The irritated crocodiles are disturbed once more -- but soon wel-\n       come the meal that just dropped in.  Jaws flash and teeth rip at\n       the High Priest's likeless corpse.\n\n       And Indy's bag with the Sankara Stones sinks into the murkly cur-\n       rent and disappears down the river ...\n\n173.   EXT.  THE CLIFF                                                173.\n\n       Indiana crawls up the burning bridge and Willie and Short Round\n       reach for him at the top.  They pull him up onto the cliff and\n       they all look around exhausted --\n\n       Across the gorge, more British troops emerge from the mine tun-\n       nels to subdue the remaining Thuggee guards on that side.\n\n       Finally the little Maharajah comes out of the dark mine tunnel.\n       He sees Short Round across the gorge -- and bows to thank him for\n       his help.  On the other side, Short Round waves his cap, saluting\n       him back.\n\n       Willie stands at the edge of the gorge looking down into the riv-\n       er far below.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       I guess Mola Ram got what he\n                       wanted.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Not quite.\n\n       She sees Indy reach into his pocket.  He pulls something out\n       slowly -- as she watches he reveals a crystal stone --\n\n                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)\n                       The last Sankara Stone.\n\n       Short Round watches Willie take it carefully from Indiana.  She\n       gazes at it and looks delighted --\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       And the diamond hidden inside...\n\n       Willie holds the stone up to the sun and it sparkles and flashes\n\n                                                               CUT TO\n\n174.   EXT.  THE MAYAPORE HILLS - DAY                                 174.\n\n       The sun flares and silhouettes three figures coming over a\n       hilltop.  Behinf them we see more smaller silhouettes appearing\n       over the rise.\n\n       Indiana, Willie and Short Round walk back down the dirt road into\n       Mayapore -- followed by a multitude of children returning to\n       their homeland.\n\n       Willie looks at the changed landscape and seems astonished:  the\n       barren countryside has been reborn.  They see streams flowing\n       beneath green trees, flowers blooming and peasants harvesting\n       golden grain in the fields.\n\n175.   EXT.  MAYAPORE VILLAGE                                         175.\n\n       Indiana, Willie and Short Round lead the children down the\n       village road.   Ahead they see villagers rebuilding their primi-\n       tive dwellings.\n\n       Now they hear shouts of joy from the peasants.  The children\n       returning home start running to meet their parents who are rush-\n       ing out to greet them.\n\n       There is laughter and tears as families are reunited.  Indiana\n       sees the old shaman approaching with the chieftain and the\n       village elders.\n\n       The shaman touches his fingers to his forehead and bows.  The\n       three travelers return his greeting and the shaman is quite moved\n       as he speaks to Indiana --\n\n                                   SHAMAN\n                       We know you are coming back --\n                                (indicating the\n                                 countryside)\n                       -- when life returns to our village.\n\n                                   WILLIE\n                       It's a real miracle.\n\n                                   SHAMAN\n                       Now you see the magic of the\n                       \"rock\" you bring back.\n\n       The old shaman smiles wisely at Indiana.  Indy takes the stone\n       out of his bag and unwraps it.\n\n                                   INDIANA\n                       Yes, I've seen its power\n\n       Willie watches the shaman take it reverently and bow to them.\n       The shaman joins the elders and they walk to the village's small\n       sacred mound.

He is completely unrecognizable to her in this moment -- a\n          killer's thousand-yard stare -- barely human -- more like a machine\n          than a man.\n                         \n          And he moves past her down the bridge, to the LRA LEADER on the\n          ground who is still alive.

Fay \n               gives him a sideways glance and he leans back down over the \n               bowl and eats some more.\n\n               Pushing the bowl away gently, he reaches out for the container \n               of milk on the table and drinks straight from it.\n\n               He suddenly jumps back and spits out sour milk all over the \n               table. The container drops to the floor and thick globs of \n               cheese roll out.\n\n               He stands back against the fridge, holding his stomach \n               while...\n\n               Fay and Mary look on in disgust.\n\n               EXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Simon crosses the lawn and sits on the curb outside his house. \n               He stares at the ground before him as he holds his stomach \n               and spits, sickened.\n\n               He looks up, though, and sees...\n\n               A little seven-year-old girl -- Pearl age seven -- standing \n               there in the street watching him.\n\n               Simon tries to smile at her.\n\n               But she throws a rock at him and hits him in the head.\n\n               He falls forward, hurt, as the little girl runs away. Lowering \n               his hand, he sees he's bleeding. Desperate, lonely and ill, \n               he drags his bloodied fingers across the coarse pavement.\n\n               Fay slams out of the side door of the house in a tight-fitting \n               dress and stands on the lawn, applying lipstick.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         God, I wanna get fucked.\n\n               Fay snaps shut her compact, straightens her skirt and sighs.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         You OK?\n\n               Simon loses track of what he is hearing and relaxes. He looks \n               back at his sister.\n\n               Fay fluffs out her hair and walks off.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         See ya later.\n\n               Simon watches her go, but is still drawn to something he \n               seems to hear up the street in the other direction. He cocks \n               his head, sits perfectly still and listens.\n\n               He hears it now. We do, too. Footsteps. Big ones. Like a \n               giant somewhere in the distance. The neighborhood trembles.\n\n               Titles begin.\n\n               Simon tries to figure out where it's coming from; the sky, \n               the house, the highway at the end of his block... Finally, \n               he focuses on...\n\n               The blacktop right before him, smeared with his own blood.\n\n               Music starts.\n\n               He kneels out slowly into the street and stares at the \n               pavement. He stretches out his hand and places it flat on \n               the road. The pounding is louder now, becoming the beat of \n               the music over the scene.\n\n               Simon lowers his face to the pavement, closes his eyes and...\n\n               Puts his ear right down against the road. He hears...\n\n               The steady tread of somebody very much larger than life.\n\n               Kneeling forward, with his ear to the ground, Simon opens \n               his eyes and sees...\n\n               A man approaching. The music swells up full.\n\n               Simon lifts his head slowly from the road, looking off in \n               wonder at...\n\n               This stranger coming towards him; an oddly handsome freak \n               striding over the crest of the distant intersection with a \n               windswept mane, two over-stuffed suitcases and a crumpled \n               tie fluttering back over his broad but crooked shoulders.\n\n               Simon rises till he's kneeling up straight in the road.\n\n               Henry Fool finally reaches him and stops.\n\n               Titles finish.\n\n               Simon says nothing and watches as Henry looks off at the \n               house.\n\n               Satisfied, but wary, Henry Fool looks around the neighborhood \n               and then down at Simon.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Get up off your knees.\n\n               He tosses the suitcases down in front of Simon and walks off \n               towards his new home.\n\n               EXT. BACK OF THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY\n\n               Henry comes around behind the house and finds the door to \n               his basement apartment. He approaches. Simon follows, carrying \n               the suitcases.\n\n               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               The door is wrenched open and Henry is hit square in the jaw \n               by a decade of dank airless gloom. He coughs.\n\n               Entering, he finds a few old wooden chairs littering the \n               main room. He inspects the old wood stove, then takes a chair \n               and smashes it. He tosses the wood in the stove.\n\n               Simon looks on, amazed. Henry lights a fire with unusually \n               quick results, then stands back and looks at Simon.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Where you gotta go to get a six-pack \n                         of beer around here?\n\n               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               This is a convenience store with a number of tables at which \n               to eat donuts.\n\n               Warren is shoplifting while Amy terrorizes Gnoc Deng, the \n               Vietnamese cashier, who stares out at them from behind the \n               safety of the counter.\n\n                                     AMY\n                         Say something.\n\n                                     WARREN\n                              (calling)\n                         She's mute.\n\n                                     AMY\n                         What?\n\n                                     WARREN\n                         She don't -- you know -- talk.\n\n               Amy looks back at Gnoc, snarls, then follows the cashier's \n               gaze to the door.\n\n               Simon enters. Clutching Henry's cash, he stops dead in his \n               tracks when he sees...\n\n               Warren and Amy.\n\n               He steps forward and approaches the beer cooler.\n\n               Warren and Amy hover around, just out of reach, like a couple \n               of vampires.\n\n               Dragging a six-pack out of the cooler, Simon crosses to the \n               counter. Warren and Amy hang back, silent and threatening.\n\n               Gnoc rings up the purchase and glances over at...\n\n               Amy, staring a hole into the side of Simon's skull.\n\n               Gnoc hands Simon back his change and he makes for the door, \n               but...\n\n               Warren shoves himself between it and Simon.\n\n               Simon freezes. Warren is expressionless. Simon looks back at \n               Amy. She turns away, reaches up under her skirt, jerks down \n               her panties, then leans forward on to the counter. Leering \n               back over her shoulder, she hisses...\n\n                                     AMY\n                         Kiss my ass.\n\n               Simon is nonplussed.\n\n               Gnoc presses a button on the wall that sets...\n\n               A red light flashing above the stockroom door.\n\n               Warren grabs Simon by the neck and drags him over to Amy's \n               bare behind. Amy laughs as Simon is forced to his knees and \n               has his face shoved up right into the crack of her ass.\n\n               But then... Simon throws up all over her.\n\n               Warren falls back in disgust.\n\n               Gnoc covers her face with her hands.\n\n               Amy looks around at herself, realizes, and starts screaming \n               bloody murder.\n\n               Simon falls back on to the floor, clutching his stomach, as \n               Amy staggers around with her vomit-strewn underwear down \n               around her ankles.\n\n               Then Gnoc's father, Mr Deng, appears at the stockroom door \n               holding a shovel and ready to fight.\n\n                                     WARREN\n                              (scared)\n                         Oh, shit!\n\n               Mr Deng comes running at them and Warren drags Amy from the \n               store. Simon crawls out of the way as the old man throws \n               open the door to the parking lot and screams at the retreating \n               delinquents...\n\n                                     MR DENG\n                              (in Vietnamese)\n                         Stay the hell out of my store, you \n                         good-for-nothing punks!\n\n               Having scared them off, he comes back in and starts screaming \n               at Simon.\n\n                                     MR DENG\n                         Look at this! What's going on here? \n                         Simon, get up off the floor! Is this \n                         beer paid for?\n\n               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n\n               Later.\n\n               Simon splashes water over his face at the kitchen sink, then \n               watches as Henry unpacks one of his suitcases. It is filled \n               with dozens of old, worn notebooks. Henry stacks them on the \n               mantelpiece over the fireplace; the fire is now crackling \n               and bright.\n\n               Simon steps over and looks at...\n\n               The name tag on the other suitcase: 'Henry Fool'.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (off-screen)\n                         Centuries ago it had an 'e' at the \n                         end.\n\n               Simon looks over and sees...\n\n               Henry's silhouette against the fire. He steps forward into \n               the light and grabs a beer from the six-pack on the floor. \n               He hands one to Simon.\n\n               Simon takes it and stares at it a moment before raising his \n               eyes to Henry.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Where do you come from?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Nowhere in particular.\n\n               He winks at Simon, then struts around the room, hugely \n               impressed with himself.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I go where I will and I do what I \n                         must.\n                              (stops, drinks)\n                         That's why I'm in trouble. I'm sort've \n                         what you might call... 'in exile'.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Why are you in trouble?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (stopping)\n                         An honest man is always in trouble, \n                         Simon. Remember that.\n\n               Simon comes away from the fire, watching him carefully. Henry \n               stands in a dim corner across the room.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         How do you know my name?\n\n               Henry pauses, looks aside, drinks, then grins demoniacally. \n               He steps forward and comes face to face with Simon. He lifts \n               his finger and points to...\n\n               Simon's name stitched upon the breast of his work shirt.\n\n               Realizing this, Simon moves off and thinks.\n\n               Henry throws more wood on the fire, glancing back over his \n               shoulder, laughing mischievously.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (stopping him)\n                         I am not retarded.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (pauses)\n                         Well...

You know. \n                         Because.\n\n               He tries to articulate what he thinks he feels but winds up \n               gesticulating curiously with his hands. This finally dissolves \n               into a dumb stare into empty space.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I see.\n\n               Simon looks at him. Henry stands and grabs a notebook from \n               off the mantelpiece. He tears out a few pages and shoves \n               them in his pocket. He hands the now fresh writing tablet to \n               Simon.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Here. Take this. And...\n\n               He searches his pockets and finds a pencil.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         ...this. Keep them with you at all \n                         times.

OK?\n\n               Simon hesitates, then accepts the gifts. Henry goes for \n               another beer while his new friend studies the dozens of \n               notebooks on the mantelpiece.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         What are these?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (proudly, returning)\n                         This?

It's a philosophy. A \n                         poetics. A politics, if you will. A \n                         literature of protest. A novel of \n                         ideas. A pornographic magazine of \n                         truly comic-book proportions. It is, \n                         in the end, whatever the hell I want \n                         it to be. And when I'm through with \n                         it, it's gunna blow a hole this wide \n                         straight through the world's own \n                         idea of itself!\n\n               He smokes. Simon is impressed. They hear a bottle smash \n               outside in the street and Henry goes to the window. They're \n               throwing bottles at the house.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (throwing down his \n                              cigarette)\n                         Come on, let's go break their arms!\n\n               Simon jumps up.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         No!\n\n               Henry stops. Simon looks away and sits back down.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (pauses)\n                         If I'm quiet.\n\n               He is ashamed of himself.\n\n               Henry sees this and settles down. He considers his new friend \n               with genuine care as he gets himself a new cigarette. He \n               lights up, thinks, then grabs another chair and sits close \n               by Simon. They sit there in silence a while, then...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Once. I forget where I was. Central \n                         America maybe. Somewhere hot. Stupid \n                         job. Bad pay. Dangerous location and \n                         water so foul the natives wouldn't \n                         even piss in it. This crowd of drunken \n                         motherfuckers hired by the local \n                         drug cartel shows up at my hotel \n                         room and threatens to tear me limb \n                         from limb. And I say, listen, hombres, \n                         OK, you've got me outnumbered four \n                         to one and you're gunna kill me here \n                         tonight and not a soul in this dimly \n                         lit world is ever gunna notice I'm \n                         gone. Fine. But one of you... one of \n                         you... one of you is gunna have his \n                         eye torn out. Period. Silence. I \n                         repeat myself. One of you poor, \n                         underpaid jerks is gunna have an eye \n                         ripped out of its socket. I promise. \n                         It's a small thing, perhaps, all \n                         things considered. But I will succeed. \n                         Because it's the only thing I have \n                         left to do in this world. So why \n                         don't you just take a good look at \n                         one another one last time and think \n                         it over for a few minutes more.\n                              (smokes, waits)\n                         They sober up a little, look at their \n                         shoes in confusion, then step out \n                         into the hall to talk among \n                         themselves.\n\n               Henry stares into the flames and falls silent. Simon is \n               riveted. He leans forward, on the edge of his seat...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         What happened?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (winking)\n                         Well, here I am, still, after all.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE. UPSTAIRS -- NIGHT\n\n               Later that night.\n\n               Simon climbs the stairs and stops when he hears raunchy sex \n               from his sister's room. He stands outside her door and \n               listens.\n\n                                     MARY\n                              (off)\n                         Did you throw up all over some girl?\n\n               Simon looks up the hall and sees his mother in her room, \n               sitting on the edge of her bed, smoking. He approaches and \n               stands in her doorway.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         They were throwing bottles at the \n                         house.\n\n               Simon says nothing. He looks down at his feet.\n\n                                     MARY\n                              (gesturing to Fay's \n                              room)\n                         She's got some ex-con in there she \n                         met at the bar. Tattoos all over \n                         himself and a big red bloated nose.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Did you take your pills?\n\n               Now she says nothing. She smokes and looks away.\n\n               Simon steps into the bathroom and gets her medication. He \n               runs a glass of water and brings it in to her.\n\n               She swallows the pills and washes them back with water.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         You want me to tell her to be quiet?\n\n               She looks away, unconcerned and cynical.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         What's the use? She might as well \n                         get it while she can. She's not always \n                         gunna have the ass she has now, you \n                         know. That's just how life is.\n\n               She throws the blanket over herself and turns off the light. \n               Simon stands there in the dark.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- NIGHT\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Simon comes downstairs into the quiet, dark kitchen and sits \n               at the table. He listens to the traffic on the highway and \n               stares off into space. Finally, he takes the notebook Henry \n               gave him from his pocket and places it before him. But then \n               he just gazes off into the dim living-room and scratches his \n               head. Returning his attention to the notebook, he digs down \n               into his pocket and retrieves his short stub of pencil.\n\n               He opens the notebook and carefully flattens back the cover. \n               Lifting the pencil, he pauses and stares at the blank page. \n               Then, after more intense hesitation, he brings the pencil's \n               dull tip to the very top left edge of the page and begins \n               writing in a slow, laborious hand.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY\n\n               The next morning.\n\n               Henry barges in the kitchen door with two containers of coffee \n               and some jelly donuts. Simon jumps up from where he sits \n               asleep over his notebook at the table.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Good morning, Simon! Glorious day, \n                         huh? Here, have a donut. Can you \n                         lend me twenty dollars?\n\n               Simon rubs the sleep from his eyes, blinks, disoriented and \n               reaches for his wallet.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Thanks.

I'm polishing up the final \n                         chapters of my 'Confession' and I \n                         need a reasonably well-stocked \n                         reference section.\n\n               He lifts up Simon's notebook.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         What's this?\n\n               Simon hesitates, shyly.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         I thought. Um. I was. I wanted to. \n                         Maybe.\n\n               He gives up, sighs and gazes at the floor. Henry flips through \n               the book, impressed. It is full from cover to cover, every \n               page dense with Simon's cryptic scrawl. Henry frowns, \n               intrigued. Then...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Can I take this?\n\n               Simon looks up, terrified. But his friend puts him at ease.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I'll correct the spelling.\n\n               EXT. JUNK YARD -- DAY\n\n               Later that day.\n\n               Simon finds a number of volumes of the classics while crushing \n               garbage.\n\n               EXT. BEHIND WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               That evening.\n\n               Simon sits with his evening beer and his new collection of \n               soiled classics. He cracks open a volume of Shakespeare and \n               tries to read. It's an obvious struggle. He puts it aside \n               and lifts up Wordsworth, studying its cover and the texture \n               of the pages. A page flutters away and he climbs down to the \n               edge of a greasy puddle to retrieve it. It's now wet and \n               torn, so he flattens it out on the concrete and tries to fit \n               it back into the book.\n\n               He reads a little, furrowing his brow, then drinks. He bites \n               his lip and tries again.\n\n               He sits back, exhausted and thinks. He hears a twig snap and \n               looks back over his shoulder to see...\n\n               Amy throws a bottle at his head.\n\n               Smash!!!! He falls to the ground, blood streaming down his \n               neck.\n\n               Warren runs over and grabs him by the shirt, lifting him out \n               of the puddle and smacking him in the head.\n\n               Amy runs forward and waits with a rolled-up newspaper which \n               she sets aflame with her lighter.\n\n               Warren punches Simon in the stomach and throws him to the \n               ground, then unzips his fly and pisses on him.\n\n               Amy watches, giggling excitedly, waving the flaming torch.\n\n               Simon crawls away and grabs hold of an old section of fence, \n               while Warren zips up and grabs the fire from Amy.\n\n               Simon pulls himself to his knees, rests his face against the \n               rusted fence and gasps for breath. Warren waves the flaming \n               torch in his face.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (weakly, unheard)\n                         One of you is gunna lose an eye.\n\n               Amy comes nearer with a can of gasoline. Simon pulls himself \n               to his feet as she splashes him with fuel. Warren is waving \n               the torch deliriously above his head.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (screaming)\n                         One of you is gunna lose an eye!\n\n               Warren stops.\n\n               Amy steps back and lowers the gas can.\n\n               Simon turns with effort to face them, adjusts his glasses \n               and continues...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         One of you. I promise.\n\n               Warren watches him blankly, then is burned by the torch which \n               is too hot to handle. He drops it.\n\n               Amy giggles, then stops, excited, but confused.\n\n               Simon grips the rusted chainlink so that it cuts into his \n               hands and stares straight at Warren.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         You can set me on fire. But one of \n                         you is gunna have an eye torn out of \n                         your head. I promise.\n\n               Warren is transfixed. He shivers and looks at Amy, who steps \n               back, scared, and puts down the gas can. She turns and walks \n               away.\n\n               Warren looks back at Simon, troubled.\n\n               He hangs there still, glaring at him.\n\n               Further away, Warren rejoins Amy and stares at his hands. \n               Amy looks ill.\n\n                                     WARREN\n                         Fuck.\n\n                                     AMY\n                         Take me home.\n\n               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               Henry is at one of the tables, correcting the spelling in \n               Simon's notebook, when he looks up and sees...\n\n               Simon stumble in, beaten and bruised, dropping his classics \n               to the floor. Henry and Mr Deng rush over to him.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (scared)\n                         Simon!

Like you said. I told \n                         them. And I knew I could do it.\n\n               He passes out. Henry looks at Mr Deng.\n\n                                     MR DENG\n                         You should take him home. He smells \n                         like a toilet.\n\n               Henry nods, agreeing, then lifts Simon off the floor. Mr \n               Deng holds the door open as Henry carries his friend out \n               into the parking lot.\n\n               Meanwhile, Gnoc gathers up the classics from the floor and \n               places them beside Simon's notebook, where it still sits \n               open on the table.

WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               Same time.\n\n               Henry enters and takes Simon's notebook from his pocket. He \n               flips through a few pages and selects one in particular.\n\n               He tears it out of the book and tapes it up beside the \n               register so customers can read it. He winks at Gnoc. She \n               smiles shyly and makes him a coffee. He takes it and moves \n               off to a table just as...\n\n               Vicky enters. She starts accumulating groceries, placing \n               them on the counter one item at a time.\n\n               Henry settles down and watches as...\n\n               Vicky returns to the counter with a bottle of orange juice \n               and notices the poem. She reads, holding the orange juice \n               out to her side.\n\n               Gnoc starts to ring up the other purchases as her father \n               comes up behind her, busying himself with an inventory of \n               the cigarettes.\n\n               Vicky's lip starts to tremble as she reads, a horrified \n               expression clouding her face. Finally...\n\n               Smash!!!! She drops the bottle of orange juice and stands \n               back.

He sits, worried, as Gnoc comes out \n               from behind the counter and begins mopping up the mess.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY\n\n               Later.\n\n               Henry is at the kitchen table with Simon, working on the \n               poem.

There's 'There'. T-H-E-R-E. \n                         There are the donuts. Then there's T-\n                         H-E-I-R; which is the possessive. It \n                         is their donut. Then, finally, there's \n                         'they're'. T-H-E-Y-'-R-E. A \n                         contraction, meaning they are. They're \n                         the donut people.

She looks Henry up and down, then shakes \n               her head disdainfully and grunts. She throws herself on the \n               couch and turns on the TV, casting acid glances over at the \n               kitchen.\n\n               EXT.

She finds Mary's \n               pills on the table and remembers to ask...\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Ma, you take your medication?\n\n               Mary is lying on the couch. She drags her eyes from the TV \n               and glances lazily at Fay, then back to the TV.\n\n                                     FAY\n                              (to herself)\n                         Guess so.\n\n               She sits at the kitchen table and lifts her magazine.\n\n               Henry shows up at the kitchen door with a pile of library \n               books. His eyes brighten when he sees...\n\n               Fay sitting there wearing only her towel. He knocks. She \n               looks back over her shoulder and sees him.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Evening, Fay.\n\n                                     FAY\n                              (disdainfully)\n                         What do you want?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I've got these books for Simon.\n\n               She turns away.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Well, leave 'em there on the counter, \n                         then.\n\n               He comes in and stacks the books near the sink. Fay pretends \n               to ignore him, but rakes her fingers through her wet hair \n               anyway, to show more shoulder.\n\n               This is not lost on Henry, who tarries and leans back against \n               the counter, salivating.\n\n               Fay flips through her magazine and Henry steps closer and \n               leans against the fridge.\n\n               She casts a bored glance in his direction, then returns her \n               attention to the TV. She senses him step aside and follows \n               his movements without turning. Suddenly his hand appears \n               from behind her and gently strokes her hair. She freezes, \n               waits, wonders...\n\n               He leans his face down beside her. She looks at him. He looks \n               at her, then down to...\n\n               Her bare legs crossed before her on the kitchen chair. His \n               hand moves down and slides itself deep in between her things.\n\n               Her mouth drops open.\n\n               He looks back up at her. He grins.\n\n               Fay jumps up and away, breathlessly clutching the towel around \n               herself.\n\n               Henry casts a glance over her body, throws his hair back out \n               of his face and shivers with lust.\n\n               Fay steps back and grabs hold of the staircase banister, \n               making an unconvincing gesture of injured pride.\n\n               Henry comes closer and she steps backwards up the stairs.\n\n               He stops, loosens his tie, holding her with his gaze.\n\n               She readjusts her towel, throws back her wet hair, sighs \n               defiantly, then sashays into her room, leaving the door ajar.\n\n               Henry waits there at the foot of the stairs, reaches down, \n               grabs his crotch and repositions his hard-on. He takes a \n               step up the stairs, then stops. He looks over to the couch \n               and sees...\n\n               Mary, lying there, sedately amazed.\n\n               He pauses, then grins.\n\n               Mary blinks and smiles sleepily.\n\n               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               Same time.\n\n               Simon sits back from his writing and rubs his neck. Putting \n               down his pencil, he looks up and sees...\n\n               Warren enter the store and grab a beer from the cooler. Seeing \n               Simon, he waves and approaches.\n\n                                     WARREN\n                         Hey, Simon, you a registered voter?\n\n               Simon hesitates, but then nods uncertainly. Warren hands him \n               a flyer. This year when you go to the polls, I want you to \n               consider Congressman Owen Feer. He wants to restore America \n               to its position of unmatched wealth, power and opportunity; \n               to revitalize American civilization and lead the human race \n               to even greater levels of freedom, prosperity and security! \n               He's a good man.\n\n               He steps over to the register and pays for his beer. Mr Deng \n               glares at him, distrustfully. Warren stops on his way out \n               and snarls at the old man...\n\n                                     WARREN\n                         Immigrant.\n\n               He leaves.

She comes to the top of the stairs and hears faint \n               activity from down below. She proceeds downstairs.\n\n               She sees no one in the kitchen, then looks in the living-\n               room and stops. She goes white, her mouth falling open in \n               horror.\n\n               Henry and Mary are screwing one another on the couch.

He stands and takes \n               a few steps away, staring at the floor.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         I don't want to think about this.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Bad move, Simon.\n\n               Simon stops and looks at him.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (pointing at him)\n                         A poet has got to be able to think \n                         about anything.\n\n               Simon pauses, then comes closer to Henry and stops.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Am I really a poet?\n\n               Henry jumps up, strides around the store and speaks at the \n               top of his voice.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Of course you are! A great poet! But \n                         you need experience. You need to do \n                         something to be ashamed of every \n                         once in a while, for cryin' out loud.\n\n               He walks to the door.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Come on!

There's a den \n                         of iniquity right across the street! \n                         You got any money?\n\n               He strides out of the store.\n\n               Simon stands there, stunned and looks at Mr Deng as the old \n               man wipes off the table with a wet rag.\n\n               INT. THE INFERNO -- NIGHT\n\n               Later that night.\n\n               Henry is dancing wildly on the bar with two sloppy-drunk \n               topless dancers. The place is rocking and the crowd cheers \n               them on.\n\n               Simon sits perched on a stool, gripping the bar with white \n               knuckles and clutching a beer, looking on in terror as...\n\n               Henry starts stripping.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- NIGHT\n\n               Later that night.\n\n               Simon stumbles in and heads upstairs. But he stops, seeing...\n\n               Mary, sitting on the top step, smoking. She looks guilty and \n               tense. So does Simon.\n\n                                     MARY\n                         That man's a bad influence.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         On who?\n\n               She gets up and storms into her room.\n\n               INT. FAY'S ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Simon comes upstairs and stops outside his bedroom door when \n               he sees...\n\n               Fay, passed out drunk on her bed. Her clothes are half off \n               and her lipstick smeared. She still grips a bottle of tequila \n               in her hand.\n\n               Simon hesitates, but then goes in and removes her shoes. He \n               gets her out of her jacket and rolls her into the bed.\n\n               Her bare limbs have their effect on Simon and he finds himself \n               staring at her thigh.\n\n               He reaches out and almost caresses her leg where her hiked-\n               up skirt reveals the bottom of her behind. He catches himself, \n               snaps his hand away and covers Fay with a blanket.\n\n               He flees.\n\n               INT. SIMON'S ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Simon is alone in the room with his bed.\n\n               The pale sheets beckon.\n\n               He is flushed. He blinks.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- NIGHT\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               He creeps down the stairs with an arm-load of books. Sitting \n               at the table, he wrenches a nearby lamp into a more useful \n               position and begins to read.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY\n\n               The next morning.\n\n               Henry stumbles up the stoop carrying a laptop computer, its \n               various accessories and a couple of coffees.\n\n               He lets himself in and dumps the computer on the kitchen \n               counter.\n\n               Simon is asleep on the couch, still in his clothes.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (shoving him)\n                         Simon.

I got ya some coffee.\n\n               Henry trudges back to the kitchen, where he whips out his \n               red pen and immediately begins to correct Simon's poem.\n\n               Simon rolls off the couch and makes his way to the table. \n               Seeing the computer...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         What's this?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         It's a computer.

Now listen. Remember how \n                         yesterday we discussed the relative \n                         desirability of cadence in relation \n                         to the readability of...\n\n                                     FAY\n                              (off)\n                         Oh, shit! Not you again!\n\n               Fay is on the stairs, hungover and disgusted. Henry throws \n               up his hands and gets up to go.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Simon, I can't work under these \n                         conditions.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Yeah!

Simon \n               runs out after Henry.\n\n               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Simon follows Henry out into the street and over towards \n               World Of Donuts...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Henry, wait up!\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I am not a rapist!\n\n               But Henry stops short, seeing...\n\n               Officer Buñuel enter World of Donuts.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Shit. Come on, this way.\n\n               And he runs down the street in the opposite direction. Simon \n               hangs back, but then follows...\n\n               INT. CHURCH -- DAY\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               They scramble in and Henry is out of breath. He slumps down \n               into a pew.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Keep a look out. Tell me when he's \n                         gone.\n\n               Simon does, but then...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Henry, what's going on?

He wants to be \n                         my friend.\n\n               He pats his pockets, looking for his smokes. Simon looks on, \n               baffled. He comes closer.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Help you with what?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (suddenly)\n                         Shhh!\n\n               He hears something, stands and moves further into the church. \n               Simon hesitates, but then follows. They hear someone crying. \n               Finally, in a pew off to one side in the shadows, they find...\n\n               A young priest named Father Hawkes. He's a wreck. He looks \n               up from his quiet sobbing and sees...\n\n               Henry and Simon standing there looking on with embarrassed \n               distaste. He lowers his head in shame. Henry moves closer \n               and sits beside the distraught priest.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         What's wrong?\n\n               The priest sighs hopelessly.\n\n                                     FATHER HAWKES\n                         I doubt.\n\n               Henry leans back with a sigh and reaches for his cigarettes.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         So, you're an honest man. Why beat \n                         yourself up about it?\n\n               He offers a cigarette to the priest and he accepts.\n\n                                     FATHER HAWKES\n                         I don't know if there are grounds \n                         for faith.

But the fact is \n                         I appreciate depravity. Nevertheless, \n                         I insist your vocation makes a \n                         difference, because to hold out \n                         anything other than a spiritual \n                         yardstick to reality is to be jerking \n                         off grandly into the abyss.

But Henry reaches \n               out and grabs his arm. Simon stops, pauses and looks back at \n               his friend.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Forgive me.\n\n               He lets go and turns away on his stool.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Forgive me, Simon.\n\n               Simon comes back over to him.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Call him, Henry. Please.\n\n               Henry gives in slowly to the inevitable. He sighs deeply and \n               stands, handing Simon a book...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         OK. Look, do me a favor.

And...\n\n               A young woman passes by, scanning the stacks. She and Henry \n               have a split second of eye contact, then she turns and moves \n               away. Henry straightens his tie and watches her go.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         This place is crawling with chicks, \n                         Simon.

You've got a rough hewn \n                         charm that sets 'em on edge. Now, \n                         listen, I gotta go.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Henry?\n\n               Henry stops and turns. Simon pauses, then...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         What did you do?\n\n               Henry watches him for a moment, then swaggers closer...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I got caught.\n\n               Simon waits for more but is disappointed. With one final \n               cracked grin at his friend, Henry throws back his shoulders, \n               slicks back his hair and strides off. Simon watches him go \n               and frowns, not comforted. He flips through the pages of \n               Paradise Lost.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (voice over)\n                         'Whereto with speedy words the arch-\n                         fiend replied Fallen Cherub, to be \n                         weak is miserable...'\n\n               INT. LIBRARY READING ROOM -- DAY\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               He comes out from the stacks, working his way through the \n               first page of Paradise Lost. He nearly bumps into a girl and \n               they stop and look at one another. He tries to hold her gaze \n               for a moment, challenging himself, but then turns away and \n               stalks to a table. He sits and leans over the page.\n\n               After a moment, though, he lifts his face and glances at...\n\n               Another girl, sitting further down the table. She looks up \n               from her reading and returns his gaze.\n\n               He smiles at her.\n\n               She gets up and leaves.\n\n               Simon frowns, confounded and returns to his book. He takes \n               out his notebook and pencil, meaning to take notes, but sees \n               instead...\n\n               A third girl sitting at another table, listening to her \n               Walkman and typing her homework into a laptop computer.\n\n               He finds himself staring at her and forces himself back to \n               his book. But he can't help himself and glances back over at \n               her.\n\n               With a sigh, he begins to write in his notebook...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (voice-over)\n                         Why is it this beautiful girl makes \n                         me sad? Does she know how beautiful \n                         she is? Do people tell her? Does she \n                         ever feel stupid?\n\n               He looks back over at her. She happens to look up and their \n               eyes meet. She smiles. Horrified, he looks down.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Why don't I smile when she looks at \n                         me? I look away. Ashamed of myself.\n\n               He watches her again, thinks, then writes...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Her figure makes me violent. I want \n                         to somehow break her. But tenderly. \n                         How is this possible? Ask Henry.\n\n               He writes a few moments more, scribbling across the page, \n               then stops and looks back over at the girl.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (voice-over)\n                         I can't breathe.\n\n               He tears out the page and folds it in half. Then he gets up \n               and crosses the room to where the girl is busily engaged in \n               her work. She looks up, sees him, and removes her headset \n               with a pleasant smile. He places his note on the table before \n               her, then turns and walks quickly away.\n\n               The girl watches him go, confused, then lifts the note and \n               reads...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (voice-over)\n                         Why do I do this to myself? And why \n                         do I reduce you to only one \n                         possibility? These are not even \n                         questions anymore. I know the answers \n                         myself. This isn't a page of notes. \n                         It's a letter. A letter to you. A \n                         desperate act. You are a miracle to \n                         me. I can't breathe.\n\n               By now, Simon is gone from the library. The girl finishes \n               reading the letter and looks around in astonishment.\n\n               INT.

She was an ugly \n                         and mean-spirited kid, but she knew \n                         how to play upon my weaknesses which, \n                         I admit, are deep and many.\n\n               He drinks, then looks at Simon and adds...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         You appear shocked.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (he is)\n                         Sorry.\n\n               Henry stands and leans over the fire.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         It was a pathetic little conspiracy. \n                         A transparently desperate attempt to \n                         discredit me and my ideas; to label \n                         me a mere pedophile. As if I'd be \n                         ashamed of such a thing. As if \n                         Socrates himself hadn't been taken \n                         out of circulation for corrupting \n                         the youth of Athens!\n\n               He comes over and takes a beer. He strides around the room, \n               thinking, reflecting.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Seven years. Seven years for one \n                         afternoon of blissful transgression. \n                         But what of it? Who cares? Prison's \n                         not so bad; particularly if one's a \n                         sex offender, free from the popular \n                         and conventional horror of sodomy.\n\n               Stops, drinks declares...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         They were not 'lost years'.\n\n               He approaches the notebooks lined up on the mantelpiece.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I put them to good use. I began my \n                         major work. My opus.\n\n               He glances over at Simon, who sits gripping his beer, \n               watching, rapt.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Believe me, Simon, this incident \n                         with the girl, prison... It pales to \n                         insignificance in the wider context \n                         of my career.\n\n               He pauses and swills back some beer. He brightens up, gets \n               excited...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Nothing in comparison to the day my \n                         'Confession' is unleashed.\n                              (beginning to pace)\n                         What an orgy we'll have then, huh? \n                         What shouts of outrage from the \n                         offended populace, from the \n                         sanctimonious purveyors of culture \n                         and quality, the righteous defenders \n                         of what ever inane and haphazard \n                         notion of progress then in vogue. \n                         They'll be beside themselves with \n                         fiercely reasoned critical analysis. \n                         Apoplectic with indignation!\n\n               Drinks sloppily, burps, wipes his mouth with his arm.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Their feelings will be hurt.\n\n               He smashes the bottle in the fireplace.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Yes, like a mirror which reflects \n                         only the inside of the person before \n                         it, my 'Confession' will lovingly \n                         render humanity's common monstrosity \n                         in all of its lurid wide screen glory.\n\n               He grabs a new beer and twists off its cap.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Why should I blush or feel shame \n                         before the common lot of humanity, \n                         anyway, for a few banal and, again I \n                         admit, inelegant transgressions?\n\n               He drinks, sighs and sits back down.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         After all, really, I'm doing \n                         civilization a favor.\n\n               Simon sits back in awe. He waits a moment and thinks. Finally \n               he stands and approaches the 'Confession'. He reaches out \n               and drags his hand across the notebooks.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         When can I read it?\n\n               Henry sits staring into the flames again. He pauses, then...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Soon.\n\n               INT.

WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               Fay comes walking up through the parking lot with Simon's \n               notebooks and a pile of typed papers. She's a wreck; tear-\n               stained face and a ball of tissues gripped in her hand like \n               a weapon. She throws open the door to the World of Donuts \n               and looks around.\n\n               The place is crowded with teenagers hanging around like it \n               was a café or student union.\n\n               Fay sniffles tragically and falls on the counter.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Gnoc, gimme a value pack of Kleenex, \n                         will ya?\n\n               Gnoc gets the Kleenex while Fay overhears two kids near \n               Simon's poem...\n\n                                     TIM\n                         The violence of the imagery reminds \n                         me of early Clash, while the lyricism \n                         of the verse recalls, for me, Walt \n                         Whitman.\n\n                                     BIBI\n                         I would have said Dickinson, maybe \n                         even Eliot, and so on.

THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY\n\n               Mary is sitting, brooding in front of the TV, which displays \n               only static white noise. She turns it off with the remote \n               and sits in silence for a moment.\n\n               She gets off the couch and moves to the kitchen table, where \n               Fay's computer sits. She goes over and reaches up above the \n               fridge, opening the cabinet containing Simon's notebooks.\n\n               She hesitates, then takes them down and holds them in her \n               hands, as if to begin reading. But then she puts them back.\n\n               She walks over to the piano and stands there, hesitating, \n               before slowly sitting down and opening it. She lifts her \n               hands to play, then pauses and looks around behind her, making \n               sure no one is there.\n\n               But, finally, she turns back and begins playing.\n\n               She plays a sad-sounding modern classical piece with rusty \n               accomplishment. At one time she was probably quite good.\n\n               She plays for a while, gradually letting herself become moved \n               by the music. But then she stops, pauses, and looks behind \n               her.\n\n               Simon is standing in the kitchen. He has been deeply affected \n               by her playing.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Please don't stop.\n\n               She stares him down a moment longer, then looks away and \n               closes the piano.

It does.\n\n               She gets up off the couch and goes upstairs. She slams her \n               bedroom door and leaves Simon alone on the couch. He thinks. \n               Then, he gets up and goes into the kitchen.\n\n               He takes the typed manuscript of his poem from the cabinet \n               above the refrigerator and goes to the door. He pauses, \n               clutches the poem and goes out.\n\n               EXT. SUBWAY STATION -- DAY\n\n               Simon waits, clutching his poem to his side, as a train pulls \n               into the station. Excited and determined, he gets on.\n\n               INT. TRAIN -- DAY\n\n               Simon travels to New York City. He finds an envelope on the \n               floor to put the poem in.\n\n               INT.

She steps over to the cabinet and almost takes \n               down Simon's notebook. But doesn't. She grabs her pills and \n               is about to take them. But then she stops. She puts them \n               down and goes to the cabinet. She takes down Simon's notebooks \n               and sits at the table, pauses, then pulls them closer and \n               begins to read.\n\n               INT.

Simon joins \n               him as he lifts something that is either a ring or a stray \n               piece of machinery.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         What is this?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Brass maybe.

It's a great idea.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         I don't know if he would want us to \n                         do that.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Sure he would. Just the first ten \n                         verses.\n\n               Fay is tempted.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         I don't know.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         He'll thank you for it later.\n\n               Frowning, she reconsiders. She gets up and takes the notebooks \n               from the cabinet above the fridge. She flips through the \n               pages but suddenly stops and turns to the door with a nicer \n               attitude.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Henry...\n\n               But he's gone. It's as if he has vanished into thin air. She \n               sighs, sits back down, and begins typing the poem onto the \n               Internet.\n\n               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Henry comes back into the store, satisfied with himself. He \n               finishes off his coffee, tosses away the cup and takes a \n               pornographic magazine from the rack. He leans on the counter \n               where Mr Deng is busy working and flips through the pages.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Gimme another one of those tall double \n                         espressos, Mr Deng.\n\n               Mr Deng starts to make him one and sees him with the magazine.\n\n                                     MR DENG\n                         You gunna buy that?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I'm just looking.\n\n                                     MR DENG\n                         Well then put it back.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         There's this fascinating story about \n                         a famous rock band and how they tied \n                         a friend of theirs to a bed in their \n                         hotel room and inserted a live fish \n                         into her vagina.\n\n               Mr Deng shakes his head and frowns.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (explains)\n                         They say she had numerous orgasms.\n\n                                     MR DENG\n                         Henry, you need to do something with \n                         your life. Get a job, or something.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I mean, it wasn't the entire fish, \n                         it was just, you know, the nose. The \n                         nose of the fish.\n\n               Mr Deng brings over the coffee. Henry is surprised to notice \n               he is not riveted.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         You don't find that interesting?\n\n                                     MR DENG\n                         No.\n\n               Henry closes the magazine and puts it back. Leaning on the \n               counter, he sips his coffee and ponders.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         You ever wonder what it would be \n                         like to have sex with an animal, Mr \n                         Deng?\n\n                                     MR DENG\n                         That coffee is free. Just take it \n                         and get out of here.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I mean, some dogs are almost as big \n                         as people and often more attractive.\n\n               Mr Deng just goes back to work, leaving Henry there at the \n               counter thinking big thoughts.\n\n               EXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- EVENING\n\n               Simon hangs from the garbage truck as it comes up the street \n               and pauses in front of his house. He jumps down and the truck \n               barrels away.\n\n               INT. FAY'S ROOM -- EVENING\n\n               Simon taps at the door. She looks over at him and he sees \n               she's been crying. He comes into the room and she sits up on \n               the edge of the bed.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Did you see him?\n\n                                     FAY\n                         He came by this afternoon.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Did you talk?\n\n                                     FAY\n                         No.\n\n               He comes over and sits beside her. He thinks a moment, then...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         You've got to tell him, Fay.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         He thinks I'm a slut.\n\n               And she starts crying again. Simon awkwardly touches her \n               shoulder, then moves his hand away. Fay pulls herself \n               together, sniffles and goes into the bathroom.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE, AT THE PIANO\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Simon comes downstairs and finds Henry at the piano. He looks \n               ill and is clutching a nearly empty container of espresso. \n               He is staring sickly at 'the ring'.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Henry?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Simon, I don't feel so good.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         What's wrong?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I feel all kinda clammy. And damp.\n\n               Simon lifts the coffee container and smells it.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         How many of these did you have?\n\n               Henry tries to remember. He squints.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Seven.\n\n               Simon puts the container down and sits at the table.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Henry, we have to talk.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Can I use your toilet?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Fay's taking a shower.\n\n               Henry grabs his stomach. He presses his hand against his \n               chest, holds his head, then stares at the ring.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         How much you think I can get for \n                         this?\n\n               He looks at Simon.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (pauses)\n                         Henry, Fay's pregnant.\n\n               Henry looks at him.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Fay's pregnant with your child.\n\n               Henry lets this sink in. He stands and the room tilts. White \n               with fear, he clutches at his rumbling gut.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE BATHROOM\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Fay is in the shower as...\n\n               Henry bursts into the bathroom, tearing at his belt and \n               trousers. She starts screaming and wraps herself in the shower \n               curtain. He drops his pants and throws himself on the toilet \n               just in time to begin shitting his brains out. Fay crouches, \n               terrified and disgusted, in the shower.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Jesus, Henry!\n\n               Henry sweats and moans as he empties his bowels in a violent \n               and messy blast of noise and foul air.\n\n               Fay covers her face and whimpers sickly.\n\n               Finally, he's done. He hangs with his face out over his knees, \n               sick, exhausted and in shock. Fay wraps herself in a towel \n               and steps out of the shower. She creeps carefully around him \n               and flushes the toilet, growing increasingly concerned.\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Hey, Henry. You OK?\n\n               He is destroyed, staring down at...\n\n               The 'ring' he still holds in his hand.\n\n               Fay sees this, looks at Henry, then kneels and takes it from \n               him. He doesn't resist. She lifts it up and breathlessly \n               admires it. Totally misunderstanding, moved beyond words...\n\n                                     FAY\n                         Oh. Oh, Henry.\n\n               And she throws her arms around him as he sits there, sweating \n               and spent, on the toilet.\n\n               INT. CHURCH -- DAY\n\n               A month later.\n\n               Mr Deng and Buñuel drag Henry, kicking and screaming, into \n               the church foyer. Once inside, he shakes them off and they \n               stand back. He huffs and puffs and tosses the hair back out \n               of his eyes. He paces back and forth like a caged animal, \n               then stops, sees...\n\n               Fay, at the altar, waiting with Simon.

My genius will be wasted \n                         trying to make ends meet!\n\n               He collapses extravagantly.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         This is how great men topple, Simon. \n                         Their hearts are in the right place \n                         too much of the time! They get \n                         sidetracked! Distracted. Oh! How \n                         could I have been so careless!\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Henry, please, let me read the \n                         'Confession'.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         No. Not now. It's not done. I'm all \n                         washed up. I'm finished!\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Angus James is convinced my poem is \n                         going to make him incredibly wealthy. \n                         He'll read your book and seriously \n                         consider publishing it. If I ask him \n                         to. I'm certain.\n\n               Henry glances back at his friend, digesting this. He thinks \n               it over, then...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Really? You really think so?\n\n               Having finally got through to him, Simon comes forward, \n               anxious to help Henry.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         I'll insist he publish the \n                         'Confession'.\n\n               He paces back and forth, thrusting out his chest, for the \n               first time in his life displaying something like pride or \n               arrogance.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (adds)\n                         Or I won't let him publish my poem.\n\n               Henry sits there watching Simon, impressed with this evidence \n               of increased self-esteem. He realizes the profundity of the \n               gesture.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         You'd do that? You'd do that for me?\n\n               Simon stares off into the distance.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         You saved my life.\n\n               Henry is moved. He stands and comes forward. He grabs his \n               friend by the shoulders and turns him around.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Do you realize what you're saying?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (pausing)\n                         I owe you everything.\n\n               Henry steps away, considering, then looks back at Simon and \n               extends his hand.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         OK.\n\n               Simon smiles. Henry smiles. They shake hands.\n\n               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY\n\n               Simon enters, comes forward into the room and pauses, looking \n               off at...\n\n               The stack of twelve books that comprise the 'Confession'.\n\n               EXT. HOUSE/BACKYARD -- DAY\n\n               Henry stands outside, watching his door.\n\n               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY\n\n               Simon lifts the first volume, opens it and begins reading. \n               He sits.\n\n               EXT. BACKYARD -- DAY\n\n               Henry paces, drinking and smoking nervously.\n\n               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n\n               Simon strides the length of the living room, reading. He \n               stops, frowns.\n\n               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n\n               Simon reads in front of the fire.\n\n               EXT. BACKYARD/GARAGE -- NIGHT\n\n               Buñuel, Hawkes and Mr Deng sleep sitting up as Henry talks \n               to himself. Fay leans out the back door and interrupts him. \n               He looks at her, but says nothing. She sighs and goes back \n               inside: turning off the lights.\n\n               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY\n\n               The next morning.\n\n               Simon sits wearily reading the final page of volume twelve \n               as the morning sun streaks into the room. Finally, he finishes \n               and slowly closes the book. He stands and crosses the room. \n               Leaning against the wall, he removes his glasses and rubs \n               his aching eyes.\n\n               EXT. BACKYARD -- DAY\n\n               Simon steps out of Henry's apartment and sees Henry asleep \n               on the back stoop.\n\n               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               Simon stares into a glass of water. Fay sits ten feet away, \n               waiting. Finally...\n\n                                     FAY\n                         It's really that bad?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         It's terrible.\n\n               INT. ANGUS JAMES' OFFICE -- DAY\n\n               The 'Confession' lies on the big desk. Angus' hand comes \n               down upon it.\n\n                                     ANGUS\n                         You've read this?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     ANGUS\n                         And you want me to consider publishing \n                         it?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     ANGUS\n                         As part of our deal?\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     ANGUS\n                         Simon, this book, it's...

Two hundred thousand dollars \n                         and a sixty/forty split.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         But just exactly what is the nature \n                         of your faith in my writing?\n\n                                     ANGUS\n                         Look, Simon, you don't require my \n                         admiration. You require my experience \n                         as a publisher. And that experience \n                         leads me to believe your poem will \n                         make more money than any book of \n                         poetry ever published. In history. \n                         Virtually make you a household name \n                         within two years.

He encouraged all that was \n                         expressive in you to become manifest. \n                         He inspired you to act. He influenced \n                         your perception.\n\n               Simon waits a while, staring at his shoes.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         How about if my advance is only a \n                         hundred thousand?\n\n                                     ANGUS\n                         It's not about money, Simon.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         We could split the royalties \n                         seventy/thirty.\n\n                                     ANGUS\n                         I will not publish Henry Fool's \n                         'Confession'.\n\n               Simon sits and lets this sink in. Angus waits, then...\n\n                                     ANGUS\n                         Will you sign the contract?\n\n               Simon continues looking out at the city. Angus waits, but \n               there is no response. Finally, Simon turns, pauses and slowly \n               crosses the room.\n\n               He sits at the table and looks down at the contract.\n\n               He signs.\n\n               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY\n\n               Fay is in labor. Henry helps her into her coat as they rush \n               for the door.\n\n               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Henry runs into the store and stands there, panicked, looking \n               at Hawkes, Buñuel and Mr Deng. Gnoc runs out to get Fay.\n\n               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY\n\n               Henry and Gnoc load Fay into the van. The van pulls out.\n\n               INT. VAN -- DAY\n\n               Henry drives recklessly. Fay rolls around in the back.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- DAY\n\n               Fay is in a wheelchair being rushed down the hall. She is \n               gripping Henry's hand as he runs along beside her.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL DELIVERY ROOM -- DAY\n\n               Fay gasps and sweats as the Doctor and Nurse prepare her. \n               She is scared. She looks over at...\n\n               Henry, looking in through the window. He looks scared too.\n\n               Fay is sedated by gas.\n\n               Henry is taken away by the Nurse.\n\n               Fay stares up at the ceiling.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT\n\n               Henry is asleep on a row of waiting-room chairs, exhausted.\n\n               Simon comes running up the hall and finds him. It's late and \n               no one is around. He sits down beside Henry and shakes him.\n\n               Henry wakes.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Simon? You're here.\n\n               He sits up and Simon sits beside him.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         What happened?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (coughs)\n                         It's a boy.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         And Fay?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         She's alright.\n\n               Simon sits back, relieved. Then he remembers the rain-soaked \n               shopping bag he has with him. He pulls out a couple of cans \n               of beer and hands one to Henry.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Thanks.\n\n               They look around, seasoned conspirators and make sure the \n               coast is clear. Then they pop open the beers and toast.\n\n               They drink. Then...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         How did it go?\n\n               Simon pauses, scared, then gets up and crosses the room. He \n               looks out of the window and gathers his strength.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                         Listen, Henry, Angus James didn't \n                         like your 'Confession'.\n\n               Henry looks at Simon blankly, then blinks and looks away.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Ah.

Henry looks up and watches him go. He can hardly \n               believe it. He almost raises his voice and apologizes, but \n               can't.

GARAGE -- NIGHT\n\n               The place is abandoned.\n\n               Henry comes in and, just as he is laying down to go to sleep \n               on an old couch, finds Pearl age fourteen.\n\n               She is hardened and disturbed, but frequently vulnerable and \n               scared; a troubled kid.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         What are you doing here, Pearl?\n\n                                     PEARL\n                         You want some?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (pauses)\n                         Some what?\n\n               Pearl comes towards him. He is kneeling with his face at her \n               crotch level when she reaches him. She holds out a bottle of \n               cheap rot-gut wine. Realizing, he takes it and drinks. He \n               winces.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Shit!\n\n               Pearl laughs and falls back onto the couch, her sweater \n               hanging off her shoulder and her skirt hiked up and displaying \n               her underwear.\n\n               Henry stands and searches for something to sit on.\n\n                                     PEARL\n                         Come sit here.\n\n               She pats the couch beside her.\n\n               He comes over, eyeing her carefully and sits. He hands back \n               the bottle. She drinks, winces and sits staring at the flames.\n\n                                     PEARL\n                         That's what my dad always says.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         What?\n\n                                     PEARL\n                              (dead)\n                         'You want some?'\n\n               Henry looks away, uncomfortable. She slides her gaze over to \n               him, their eyes meet, and she pins him to the spot.\n\n                                     PEARL\n                         People say you were once in jail for \n                         having sex with a girl my age.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         That was a long time ago.\n\n               He gets up and stands at the window. Pearl age fourteen \n               watches him closely as she drinks, then...\n\n                                     PEARL\n                         You want some?\n\n               He looks over at her and she slides her coat off her shoulder. \n               Henry is sweating.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         You oughta get outta here, Pearl.\n\n                                     PEARL\n                         I was here first.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Go home.\n\n                                     PEARL\n                         You go home.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Fine.\n\n               And he starts to leave. But Pearl sits up...\n\n                                     PEARL\n                              (scared)\n                         Wait!\n\n               Henry stops and looks back at her.\n\n                                     PEARL\n                              (hanging her head)\n                         I can't go home.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (concerned)\n                         Why not?\n\n                                     PEARL\n                         He beat her up again.\n\n               Henry holds his head, tries to sober up. He looks around the \n               room, then focuses on the girl.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Warren beat up your mom?\n\n               Pearl stares at the floor. She glances over at him, then \n               back down at the bottle gripped in her hands. She nods.\n\n               Henry pauses, then comes across the room, lowering himself \n               tentatively to the couch.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Is she alright?\n\n               She says nothing for a moment, then...\n\n                                     PEARL\n                              (sadly)\n                         Do you think I'm pretty?\n\n               Henry lifts his hand and covers his face. He looks up at the \n               ceiling and sighs. He returns to Pearl...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Does she need help?\n\n               Pearl reaches over and grabs his thigh. Looking up at him, \n               with tears rolling down her face, she suggests...\n\n                                     PEARL\n                         I'll suck your cock if you kill him \n                         for me.\n\n               Henry jumps away from her and Pearl throws herself down on \n               the couch, covering her face.\n\n               INT. VICKY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               Henry barges in and starts searching for...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Vicky! Vicky, it's Henry from across \n                         the street! Vicky!\n\n               He runs through the house, checking the rooms. He throws \n               open the door to the bedroom and finds...\n\n               Vicky, sitting on the edge of the bed, smoking. She has a \n               black eye and a swollen cheek.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (taken back)\n                         Vicky?\n\n                                     VICKY\n                              (standing)\n                         What do you think you're doing, you \n                         idiot!\n\n                                     WARREN\n                              (off)\n                         Hey!\n\n               Henry looks over and sees Warren stumble drunkenly out of \n               the bathroom. What are you doing in my house?\n\n                                     HENRY\n                              (to Vicky)\n                         It's about Pearl.\n\n               Vicky looks troubled.

She looks away.\n\n               Henry looks at Warren, pauses, then gives him a sharp, hard \n               shove.\n\n               Warren stands back against the wall, pauses, then erupts \n               into viciousness.\n\n               He grabs Henry and throws him violently down the hall, where \n               he hits the wall and collapses.\n\n               As Henry gets to his knees, Warren kicks him in the ribs. \n               Henry curls up and rolls out on to the kitchen floor. Warren \n               kicks him in the side of the head.\n\n               Vicky sits back down on the bed, covering her ears.\n\n               Warren beats the hell out of Henry, kicking him in the face \n               and ribs whenever he manages to get up on his hands and knees. \n               Henry crawls under the kitchen table for safety. Warren grabs \n               his feet and drags him out. As he is dragged across the floor, \n               Henry finds a screwdriver and grabs it. He rolls over on his \n               back as...\n\n               Warren lunges down at him again and...\n\n                                     WARREN\n                         Ah.\n\n               Warren is stabbed in the heart.\n\n               Henry can't believe it.\n\n               Warren can't believe it. He stands there in the middle of \n               the kitchen, amazed, with the screwdriver sticking out of \n               his chest.\n\n               Henry, semi-conscious and severely beaten, falls against the \n               back door and coughs up a few of his teeth. Vicky steps into \n               the hall from her room and shudders.\n\n               Warren sits at the table, stunned. He looks from the \n               screwdriver to Vicky, then...\n\n                                     WARREN\n                         Fuck.\n\n               He falls to the floor.\n\n               EXT.

He looks on in horror \n               at...\n\n               Henry, lying on a makeshift bed, badly beaten up and weak. \n               Mr Deng is wrapping his chest in bandages.\n\n               Simon pauses, then comes closer. He reaches out and touches \n               Henry's shoulder, standing there looking down at his friend. \n               Henry looks up at him, pauses and then gestures vaguely with \n               his hand.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Look, Simon, the world's a scary \n                         place. I admit it. But it's not my \n                         fault.

He \n               points down the street with great urgency. The cops jump in \n               their cars and take off. He then looks over at...\n\n               Fay, leaving the house with Henry's suitcase.\n\n               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS BACK ALLEY -- DAY\n\n               Same time.\n\n               Buñuel backs his car into the alley behind World of Donuts. \n               Stepping out of the car he hands Simon back the passport.\n\n               Simon checks it and then looks up to see...\n\n               Father Hawkes and Mr Deng helping Henry outside. Coming out \n               into the daylight, he straightens up and manages to walk on \n               his own. He motions Ned over and leans down to the kid with \n               difficulty.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Gotta light?\n\n               Ned does. He has his own Zippo lighter and he proudly lights \n               his dad's cigarette.\n\n               Henry smokes, hugs Ned, then leans back and pauses. Finally...\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         Take care of your mom and don't start \n                         trouble you can't finish.\n\n               Ned nods and Henry pats him on the shoulder. Then he stands \n               before Fay and looks at his feet. With her arms folded across \n               her chest and her hip cocked, she taps her foot impatiently \n               and waits for his last line of crap.\n\n                                     HENRY\n                         I love you, Fay.\n\n                                     FAY\n                              (rolls her eyes)\n                         Yeah, well, tough.\n\n               But then she looks at him and softens. He leans in and kisses \n               her passionately on the mouth.\n\n               Moments later, they all help Henry into Buñuel's car and \n               Simon gets in behind the wheel. The doors slam shut and Simon \n               steers the car slowly up the alley. Henry gazes out at Fay \n               running along beside the car with the rest of the \n               neighborhood, some of them laughing, some of them crying...\n\n               EXT.

Excuse me!\n\n               As they are ushered up towards the gate, Henry stops and \n               looks off at the security guards and ground crew waiting for \n               him, certain they can spot him as a wanted criminal.\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (shoves him)\n                         Go on.\n\n               Henry is ushered through security. They take his ticket and \n               check his passport again. They take his suitcase and place \n               it on the conveyor belt. He passes through the metal detector. \n               They pass the metal detector wand over him and he stands \n               there with his hands outstretched, as...\n\n               Simon waits and watches.\n\n               The suitcase rolls out from the x-ray machine and as Henry \n               grabs it, he stops and looks across the security checkpoint \n               at...\n\n               Simon, standing there. He steps forward anxiously.\n\n               Henry lingers, speechless, but the airline representatives \n               are at his side...\n\n                                     AIRLINE REP\n                         Mr Grim, please, the plane is waiting! \n                         We have to hurry!\n\n               They drag him away, but Henry looks back as...\n\n               Simon stops and watches.\n\n               EXT. AIRPORT RUNWAY -- DAY\n\n               Moments later.\n\n               The plane is waiting out on the asphalt and the airline \n               representative runs straight for it, calling back over her \n               shoulder to Henry...\n\n                                     AIRLINE REP\n                         This way, Mr Grim! This way!\n\n               Runway technicians rush to their positions, but Henry hangs \n               back and struggles across the tarmac, looking back over his \n               shoulder at...\n\n               Simon, behind the huge plate glass window of the terminal.\n\n               He stops and waits.\n\n               Simon raises his hand in farewell and...\n\n               Henry raises his in reply.\n\n               Then Simon, unheard behind the gigantic glass wall, silent \n               amongst the roar of the runway, says...\n\n                                     SIMON\n                              (unheard)\n                         Run.\n\n               And Henry understands. He lowers his hand, waits just a \n               moment, then turns and looks out at...\n\n               The airplane. The airline representative is shouting at him \n               from the foot of the stairs and waving him on with her walkie-\n               talkie.\n\n               He glances back once more at Simon. Then...\n\n               Henry is running, struggling towards us, forcing himself \n               towards the plane, getting stronger and running faster with \n               every step he takes.\n\n                                                               CUT TO BLACK\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Fool\nWriters :   Hal Hartley\nGenres :   Comedy  Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n"

LANDON \n                      Do you wanna sit down? \n\n                                LINDA \n                      I need to sit down.\n\n                                DR. LANDON \n                      Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it.\n                      He's dying. He is.  He is dying very,\n                      very rapidly -- \n\n     She breaks a bit more.\n\n                                DR. LANDON \n                      Now the thing here is making that experience \n                      as painless and easy as possible for him, \n                      you understand?  Now you need to get in touch \n                      with Hospice care because they can take care of\n                      all those practical things that you're asking \n                      me about -- they are who you call when he dies. \n\n     He writes a number on his bussiness card, hands it over as they speak;\n\n                                DR. LANDON \n                      This is the number for Hospice.\n                      Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go,\n                      there is something else to consider that\n                      can take the pain away that he is in,\n                      there is a very strong and very potent solution\n                      of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle,\n                      with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in\n                      his mouth and drop on his tounge and \n                      it will certainly diminish the pain that\n                      he is in but you have to realize that\n                      once you give it to him; there really \n                      is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly\n                      cure his pain, but he will float in and \n                      out of consciousness, even worse than he\n                      is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the \n                      recognizable Earl will pretty much go away -- \n\n                                LINDA \n                      -- how the fuck can I say anything \n                      to that -- I don't know what to say to that -- \n\n                                DR. LANDON \n                      The job here is to make him as comfortable \n                      as possible -- right now -- our job is to just\n                      try and make it as painless as possible.\n                      Right?

PARK - DAY\n\nBrief shot of duel.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tMy father, who was well-known to the\n\tbest circles in this kingdom under\n\tthe name of roaring Harry James, was\n\tkilled in a duel, when I was fifteen\n\tyears old.\n\nEXT.  GARDEN - DAY\n\nMrs. James, talking with a suitor; Roderick, at a\ndistance.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tMy mother, after her husband's\n\tdeath, and her retirement, lived in\n\tsuch a way as to defy slander.  She\n\trefused all offers of marriage,\n\tdeclaring that she lived now for her\n\tson only, and for the memory of her\n\tdeparted saint.\n\nEXT.  STREET - DAY\n\nMother and son walking together.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tMy mother was the most beautiful\n\twomen of her day.  But if she was\n\tproud of her beauty, to do her\n\tjustice, she was still more proud of\n\ther son, and has said a thousand\n\ttimes to me that I was the\n\thandsomest fellow in the world.\n\nEXT.  CHURCH - DAY\n\nMother and son entering church.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tThe good soul's pleasure was to\n\tdress me; and on Sundays and\n\tHolidays, I turned out in a velvet\n\tcoat with a silver-hilted sword by\n\tmy side, and a gold garter at my\n\tknee as fine as any lord in the\n\tland.  As we walked to church on\n\tSundays, even the most envious souls\n\twould allow that there was not a\n\tprettier pair in the kingdom.\n\nEXT.  FIELD - DAY\n\nA picnic.  The Dugan family.  Roderick.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tMy uncle's family consisted of ten\n\tchildren, and one of them was the\n\tcause of all my early troubles; this\n\twas the belle of the family, my\n\tcousin, Miss Dorothy Dugan, by name.\n\nEXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY\n\nA sprawling run-down Irish manor house with large garden,\nstables, barn and farm.\n\nIdealized images of Dorothy.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAh!  That first affair, how well one\n\tremembers it!  What a noble\n\tdiscovery it is that the boy makes\n\twhen he finds himself actually and\n\ttruly in love with some one!  A lady\n\twho is skilled in dancing or singing\n\tnever can perfect herself without a\n\tdeal of study in private.  So it is\n\twith the dear creatures who are\n\tskilled in coquetting.  Dorothy, for\n\tinstance, was always practicing, and\n\tshe would take poor me to rehearse\n\ther accomplishments upon...\n\nDorothy talking with the exciseman.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\t... or the exciseman, when he came\n\this rounds.\n\nDorothy talking to the steward.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\t... or the steward.\n\nDorothy sitting under a tree with the curate, reading a\nbook.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\t... or the poor curate.\n\nDorothy talking to the apothecary's lad.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\t... or the young apothecary's lad\n\tfrom Dugan's Town whom I recollect\n\tbeating once for that very reason.\n\nRoderick, fighting with apothecary's lad.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tThe torments of jealousy she made me\n\tendure were horrible.\n\nEXT.  FIELD - DAY\n\nDorothy, like a greyhound released from days of\nconfinement, and given the freedom of the fields at last,\nruns at top-speed, left and right, back and forth,\nreturning every moment to Roderick.\n\nShe runs and runs until she is out of breath, and then\nlaughs at the astonishment which keeps Roderick motionless\nand staring at her.\n\nAfter catching her breath, and wiping her forehead, she\nchallenges Roderick to a race.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI accept, but I insist on a wager.\n\tThe loser must do whatever the\n\twinner pleases.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tAgreed.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tDo you see the gate at the end of\n\tthe field?  The first to touch it\n\twill be the winner.\n\nThey line up together and start on a count of three.\nDorothy uses all her strength, but Roderick holds back,\nand Dorothy touches the gate five or six paces ahead of\nhim.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI was certain to win, but I meant to\n\tlose to see what she would order me\n\tto do.\n\nDorothy catches her breath, thinking of the penalty.  Then\nshe goes behind the trees and, a few second later, comes\nout and says:\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tYour penalty is to find a cherry-\n\tcolored ribbon which I have hidden\n\tsomewhere on my person.  You are\n\tfree to look for it anywhere you\n\twill, and I will think very little\n\tof you if you do not find it.\n\nThey sit down on the grass.  Roderick searches her\npockets, the fold of her short bodice and her skirt, then\nher shoes; then he turns up her skirt, slowly and\ncircumspectly, as high as her garters, which she wears\nupon the knee.  He unfastens them and finds nothing; he\ndraws down her skirt and gropes under her armpits.  The\ntickling makes her laugh.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI feel the ribbon.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tThen you must get it.\n\nRoderick has to unlace her bodice and touch her pretty\nbreasts, over which his hand must pass to reach it.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tWhy are you shaking?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tWith pleasure at finding the ribbon.\n\nEXT.  FIELD - DAY\n\nMilitary review.  One hundred English troops, a few\nmounted officers, a small military band, fifty local\npeople.\n\nThe Dugan family, Roderick and his mother, Captains Best\nand Grogan.\n\nRoderick admires the troops in their splendid uniforms.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAbout this time, the United Kingdom\n\twas in a state of great excitement\n\tfrom the threat generally credited\n\tof a French invasion.  The noblemen\n\tand people of condition in that and\n\tall other parts of the kingdom\n\tshowed their loyalty by raising\n\tregiments of horse and foot to\n\tresist the invaders.  How I envied\n\tthem.  The whole country was alive\n\twith war's alarums; the three\n\tkingdoms ringing with military\n\tmusic, while poor I was obliged to\n\tstay at home in my fustian jacket\n\tand sigh for fame in secret.\n\nINT.  BALLROOM AT FENCIBLES - NIGHT\n\nDorothy and Roderick entering.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tOnce, the officers of the Kilwangen\n\tregiment gave a grand ball to which\n\tDorothy persuaded my to take her.\n\nSeveral cuts depicting the evening.\n\nDorothy ignores Roderick; dances, chats, laughs, drinks\npunch, and finally, strolls outside with Captain Best.\n\nRoderick makes a half-hearted try at dancing with Miss\nClancy.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI have endured torments in my life,\n\tbut none like that.  Some of the\n\tprettiest girls there offered to\n\tconsole me, for I was the best\n\tdancer in the room, but I was too\n\twretched, and so remained alone all\n\tnight in a state of agony.  I did\n\tnot care for drink, or know the\n\tdreadful comfort of it in those\n\tdays; but I thought of killing\n\tmyself and Dorothy, and most\n\tcertainly of making away with\n\tCaptain Best.\n\nEXT.  FENCIBLES BALLROOM - DAWN\n\nThe guests leaving and saying their goodbyes.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAt last, and at morning, the ball\n\twas over.\n\nEXT.  ROAD - DAWN\n\nDorothy and Roderick on horseback together.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tSure it's a bitter night, Roderick\n\tdear, and you'll catch cold without\n\ta handkerchief to your neck.\n\nTo this sympathetic remark, from the pillion, the saddle\nmade no reply.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tDid you and Miss Clancy have a\n\tpleasant evening, Roderick?  You\n\twere together, I saw, all night.\n\nTo this, the saddle only replies by grinding his teeth,\nand giving a lash to Daisy.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tOh!  Mercy, you make Daisy rear and\n\tthrow me, you careless creature,\n\tyou.\n\nThe pillion had by this got her arm around the saddle's\nwaist, and gave it the gentlest squeeze in the world.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI hate Miss Clancy, you know I do!\n\tAnd I only danced with her because\n\t-- because -- the person with whom I\n\tintended to dance chose to be\n\tengaged the whole night.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tI had not been in the room five\n\tminutes before I was engaged for\n\tevery single set.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tWere you obliged to dance five times\n\twith Captain Best, and then stroll\n\tout with him into the garden?\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tI don't care a fig for Captain Best;\n\the dances prettily to be sure, and\n\tis a pleasant rattle of a man.  He\n\tlooks well in his regimentals, too;\n\tand if he chose to ask me to dance,\n\thow could I refuse him?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tBut you refused me, Dorothy.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tOh!  I can dance with you any day,\n\tand to dance with your own cousin at\n\ta ball as if you could find no other\n\tpartner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain\n\tBest's a man, and you are only a\n\tboy, and you haven't a guinea in the\n\tworld.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tIf ever I meet him again, you shall\n\tsee which is the best man of the\n\ttwo.  I'll fight him with sword or\n\twith pistol, captain as he is.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tBut Captain Best is already known as\n\ta valiant soldier, and is famous as\n\ta man of fashion in London.  It is\n\tmighty well of you to fight farmers'\n\tboys, but to fight an Englishman is\n\ta very different matter.\n\nRoderick falls silent.\n\nEXT.  SMALL BRIDGE OVER A STREAM - DAWN\n\nThey come to an old, high bridge, over a stream,\nsufficiently deep and rocky.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tSuppose, now, Roderick, you, who are\n\tsuch a hero, was passing over the\n\tbridge and the enemy on the other\n\tside.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI'd draw my sword, and cut my way\n\tthrough them.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tWhat, with me on the pillion?  Would\n\tyou kill poor me?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tWell, then, I'll tell you what I'd\n\tdo.  I'd jump Daisy into the river,\n\tand swim you both across, where no\n\tenemy could follow us.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tJump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare\n\tto do any such thing on Daisy.\n\tThere's the captain's horse, Black\n\tGeorge, I've heard say that Captain\n\tBes --\n\nShe never finished the word for, maddened by the continual\nrecurrence of that odious monosyllable, Roderick shouts:\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tHold tight to my waist!\n\nAnd, giving Daisy the spur, springs with Dorothy over the\nparapet, into the deeper water below.\n\nThe horse's head sinks under, the girl screams as she\nsinks, and screams as she rises.\n\nRoderick lands her, half-fainting, on the shore.\n\nINT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY\n\nVarious cuts showing illness and convalescence.\n\nRoderick feverish:  the doctor taking his pulse.\n\nMother brings a tray of food.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI went home, and was ill speedily of\n\ta fever, which kept me to my bed for\n\ta week.\n\nDorothy visiting him.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tDorothy visited me only once, but I\n\tquitted my couch still more\n\tviolently in love than I had been\n\tever before.\n\nEXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY\n\nThe air is fresh and bright, and the birds sing loud\namidst the green trees.  Roderick is elated, and springs\ndown the road, as brisk as a young fawn.\n\nHe encounters an orderly whistling \"Roast Beef of Old\nEngland,\" as he cleans down a cavalry horse.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tWhose horse, fellow, is that?\n\n\t\t\tORDERLY\n\tFeller, indeed!  The horse belongs\n\tto my captain, and he's a better\n\tfellow nor you any day.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI did not stop to break his bones,\n\tas I would on another occasion, for\n\ta horrible suspicion had come across\n\tme, and I made for the garden as\n\tquickly as I could.\n\nRoderick see Captain Best and Dorothy pacing the path\ntogether.  Her arm is under his, and he is fondling and\nsqueezing her little hand which lies closely nestling\nagainst his arm.\n\nSome distance beyond them is Captain Grogan, who is paying\ncourt to Dorothy's sister, Mysie.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tThe fact is that, during the week of\n\tmy illness, no other than Captain\n\tBest was staying at Castle Dugan,\n\tand making love to Miss Dorothy in\n\tform.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n\tNo, Dorothy, except for you and four\n\tothers, I vow before all the gods,\n\tmy heart had never felt the soft\n\tflame.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tAh, you men, you men, John, your\n\tpassion is not equal to ours.  We\n\tare like -- like some plant I've\n\tread of -- we bear but one flower,\n\tand then we die!\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n\tDo you mean you never felt an\n\tinclination for another?\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tNever, my John, but for thee!  How\n\tcan you ask me such a question?\n\nRaising her hand to his lips.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n\tDarling Dorothea!\n\nRoderick rushes into view, drawing his little sword.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI pulled out a knot of cherry-\n\tcolored ribbons, which she had given\n\tme out of her breast, and which\n\tsomehow I always wore upon me, and\n\tflung them in Captain Best's face,\n\tand rushed out with my little sword\n\tdrawn.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tShe's a liar -- she's a liar,\n\tCaptain Best!  Draw, sir, and defend\n\tyourself, if you are a man!\n\nRoderick leaps at Captain Best, and collars him, while\nDorothy makes the air echo with her screams.\n\nCaptain Grogan and Mysie hasten up.\n\nThough Roderick is a full growth of six feet, he is small\nby the side of the enormous English captain.\n\nBest turns very red at the attack upon him, and slips back\nclutching at his sword.\n\nDorothy, in an agony of terror, flings herself round him,\nscreaming:\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tCaptain Best, for Heaven's sake,\n\tspare the child -- he is but an\n\tinfant.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n\tAnd ought to be whipped for his\n\timpudence, but never fear, Miss\n\tDugan, I shall not touch him, your\n\tfavorite is safe from me.\n\nSo saying, he stoops down and picks up the bunch of\nribbons, which Roderick had flung at Dorothy's feet, and\nhanding it to her, says in a sarcastic tone:\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n\tWhen ladies make presents to\n\tgentlemen, it is time for other\n\tgentlemen to retire...\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tGood heavens, Best!  He is but a boy\n\tand don't signify any more than my\n\tparrot or lap-dog.  Mayn't I give a\n\tbit of ribbon to my own cousin?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (roaring)\n\tI'm a man, and will prove it.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n\tYou are perfectly welcome, miss, as\n\tmany yards as you like.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tMonster!  Your father was a tailor,\n\tand you are always thinking of the\n\tshop.  But I'll have my revenge, I\n\twill!  Roddy, will you see me\n\tinsulted?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tIndeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to\n\thave his blood as sure as my name's\n\tRoderick.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n\tI'll send for the usher to cane you,\n\tlittle boy, but as for you, miss, I\n\thave the honor to wish you a good\n\tday.\n\nBest takes off his hat with much ceremony, and makes a low\nbow, and is just walking off, when Michael, Roderick's\ncousin, comes up, whose ear has likewise been caught by\nthe scream.\n\n\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\tHoity-toity!  John Best, what's the\n\tmatter here?\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n\tI'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan.\n\tI have had enough of Miss Dugan here\n\tand your Irish ways.  I ain't used\n\tto 'em, sir.\n\n\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t   (good-humoredly)\n\tWell, well!  What is it?  We'll make\n\tyou used to our ways, or adopt\n\tEnglish ones.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n\tIt's not the English way, for ladies\n\tto have two lovers, and, so, Mr.\n\tDugan, I'll thank you to pay me the\n\tsum you owe me, and I resign all\n\tclaims to this young lady.  If she\n\thas a fancy for school-boys, let her\n\ttake 'em, sir.\n\n\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\tPooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n\tI never was more in earnest.\n\nBest exits.\n\n\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t   (in a towering rage)\n\tYou -- you!  Hang you for a meddling\n\tbrat, your hand is in everybody's\n\tpie.  What business had you to come\n\tbrawling and quarreling here, with\n\ta gentleman who has fifteen hundred\n\ta-year?\n\nMichael runs after Best.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t   (gasps)\n\tOh, I shall die; I know I shall.  I\n\tshall never leave this spot.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\t\t   (whisper to Dorothy)\n\tThe Captain is gone.\n\nDorothy, giving him an indignant look, jumps up and walks\ntowards the house.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\t\t   (in a soothing tone\n\t\t    to Roderick)\n\tThis is a pretty way to recommend\n\tyourself to the family.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (shouts after\n\t\t    Michael)\n\tThe man that marries Dorothy Dugan\n\tmust first kill me -- do you mind\n\tthat?\n\n\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t   (shouting back from\n\t\t    a distance)\n\tPooh, sir.  Kill you -- flog you,\n\tyou mean!  I'll send for Nick the\n\thuntsman to do it.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tYou are a gallant lad, and I like\n\tyour spirit.  But what Dugan says is\n\ttrue.  It's a hard thing to give a\n\tlad counsel who is in such a far-\n\tgone state as you; but, believe me,\n\tI know the world, and if you will\n\tbut follow my advice, you won't\n\tregret having taken it.  Dorothy\n\tDugan has not a penny; you are not a\n\twhit richer.  And, my poor boy,\n\tdon't you see -- though it's a hard\n\tmatter to see -- that she's a flirt,\n\tand does not care a pin for you or\n\tBest either?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tDorothy might love me or not, as she\n\tlikes, but Best will have to fight\n\tme before he marries her!\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tFaith, I think you are a lad that's\n\tlikely to keep your word.\n\nHe looks hard at Roderick for a second to two, then he\nwalks away, humming a tune, looking back at Roderick as he\ngoes through the old gate out of the garden.\n\nWhen Grogan is gone, Roderick is quite alone, and he\nflings himself down on the bench where Dorothy had made\nbelieve to faint, and had left her handkerchief and the\nribbons and, taking them up, hides his face in them, and\nbursts into a passion of tears.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI must have sat for some hours\n\tbemoaning myself on the garden-bench,\n\tfor the dinner-bell clanged as usual\n\tat three o'clock, which wakened me\n\tfrom my reverie.\n\nEXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY\n\nAs Roderick passes the courtyard, he sees the Captain's\nsaddle still hanging up at the stable-door, and his odious\nred-coated brute of a servant, swaggering with the\nscullion-girls and kitchen people.\n\n\t\t\tMAID\n\tThe Englishman's still there, Master\n\tRoderick.  He's there in the parlor.\n\tGo in, and don't let 'im browbeat\n\tyou, Master Roderick.\n\nINT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY\n\nRoderick enters and takes his place at the bottom of the\nbig table; the butler speedily brings him a cover.\n\n\t\t\tUNCLE\n\tHello, Roddy, my boy!  Up and well?\n\tThat's right.\n\n\t\t\tAUNT\n\tHe'd better be home with his mother.\n\n\t\t\tUNCLE\n\tDon't mind her.  It's the cold goose\n\tshe ate for breakfast -- didn't\n\tagree with her.  Take a glass of\n\tspirits, Mrs. Dugan, to Roderick's\n\thealth.\n\nIt is evident that his uncle doesn't know of what\nhappened, but Michael, who is at dinner too, and Harry,\nand almost all the girls, look exceedingly black and the\ncaptain foolish; and Miss Dorothy, who is again by his\nside, ready to cry.  Captain Grogan sits smiling, and\nRoderick looks on as cold as stone.\n\nHis uncle is in high good-humor.\n\n\t\t\tUNCLE\n\tDorothy, divide that merry thought\n\twith the captain!  See who'll be\n\tmarried first.  Jack Best, my dear\n\tboy, never mind a clean glass for\n\tthe claret, we're short of crystal\n\tat Castle Dugan; take Dorothy's and\n\tthe wine will taste none the worse.\n\tMrs. Dugan and ladies, if you\n\tplease; this is a sort of toast that\n\tis drunk a great deal too seldom in\n\tmy family, and you'll please to\n\treceive it with all the honors.\n\tHere's to Captain and Mrs. John\n\tBest, and long life to them.  Kiss\n\ther, Jack, you rogue; for faith,\n\tyou've got a treasure.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (spring up)\n\tHis already?!\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\tHold your tongue, you fool -- hold\n\tyour tongue!\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (shouting)\n\tHe has already been slapped in the\n\tface this morning, Captain John\n\tBest; he's already been called a\n\tcoward, Captain John Best; and this\n\tis the way I'll drink his health.\n\tHere's your health, Captain John\n\tBest.\n\nRoderick flings a glass of claret into his face.  The next\nmoment, he is under the table, tripped up by Harry, who\nhits him a violent cuff on the head; as he goes down, he\nhardly has time to hear the general screaming and\nscurrying that is taking place above him, being so fully\noccupied with kicks, and thumps and curses, with which\nHarry is belaboring him.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\tYou fool!  You great blundering\n\tmarplot -- you silly beggarly\n\tbrat --\n\t\t   (a thump at each)\n\tHold your tongue!\n\nWhen Roderick gets up from under the table, the ladies are\nall gone; but he has the satisfaction of seeing the\ncaptain's nose is bleeding, as his is -- Best is cut\nacross the bridge, and his beauty spoiled forever.\n\n\t\t\tUNCLE\n\tIn Heaven's name, what does all the\n\trow mean?  Is the boy in fever\n\tagain?\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\t   (turning to his\n\t\t    father)\n\tThe fact is, sir, that the young\n\tmonkey has fallen in love with\n\tDorothy, and finding her and the\n\tcaptain mighty sweet in the garden\n\ttoday, he was for murdering Jack\n\tBest.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n\t\t   (bristling up)\n\tAnd, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan,\n\tI've been insulted grossly in this\n\thouse.  I ain't at all satisfied\n\twith these here ways of going on.\n\tI'm an Englishman, I am, and a man\n\tof property; and I -- I --\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\tIf you're insulted, and not\n\tsatisfied, remember there's two of\n\tus, Best.\n\nOn which, the captain falls to washing his nose in water,\nand answering never a word.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (in dignified tone)\n\tMr. Best may also have satisfaction\n\tany time he pleases, by calling on\n\tRoderick James, Esquire, of\n\tJamesville.\n\nHis uncle bursts out laughing, and in this laugh, Captain\nGrogan joins.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tCaptain Grogan, I beg you to\n\tunderstand that, for my cousin\n\tHarry, who has been my best friend\n\tthrough life, I could put up with\n\trough treatment from him; yet, even\n\tthat sort of treatment I will bear\n\tfrom him no longer; and any other\n\tperson who ventures on the like will\n\tnot like the cost.  Mr. Best knows\n\tthat fact very well; and, if he's\n\tman, he'll know where to find me.\n\n\t\t\tUNCLE\n\tIt is getting late, and your mother\n\twill be anxious about you.  One of\n\tyou had better go home with him.\n\t\t   (turning to his sons)\n\tOr the lad may be playing more\n\tpranks.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\tBoth of us ride home with Best here.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n\tI'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My\n\tman is armed, and so am I.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\tYou know the use of arms very well,\n\tBest, and no one can doubt your\n\tcourage; but Michael and I will see\n\tyou home for all that.\n\n\t\t\tUNCLE\n\tWhy, you'll not be home till\n\tmorning, boys.  Kilwangan's a good\n\tten miles from here.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\tWe'll sleep in Best's quarters.\n\tWe're going to stop a week there.\n\tAnd, in another week, my boy.\n\nAnd here, Harry whispers something in the Captain's ear.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tI'll go home with the boy.\n\nEXT.  ROAD - LATE DAY\n\nGrogan walks with Roderick.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tA pretty day's work of it you have\n\tmade, Master Roderick.  Knowing your\n\tuncle to be distressed for money,\n\tand try and break off a match which\n\twill bring fifteen hundred a-year\n\tinto the family?  Best has promised\n\tto pay off the four thousand pounds\n\twhich is bothering your uncle so.\n\tHe takes a girl without a penny -- a\n\tgirl that has been flinging herself\n\tat the head of every man in these\n\tparts these ten years past, and\n\tmissing them all, and a boy who\n\tought to be attached to your uncle\n\tas to your father.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tAnd so I am.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tAnd this is the return you make for\n\this kindness!  Didn't he harbor you\n\tin his house when your father died,\n\tand hasn't he given you and your\n\tmother, rent-free, your fine house\n\tof Jamesville yonder?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tMark this, come what will of it, I\n\tswear I will fight the man who\n\tpretends to the hand of Dorothy\n\tDugan.  I'll follow him if it's into\n\tthe church, and meet him there.\n\tI'll have his blood, or he shall\n\thave mine.  Will you take my message\n\tto him, and arrange the meeting?\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tWell, if it must be, it must.  For a\n\tyoung fellow, you are the most\n\tbloodthirsty I ever saw.  No\n\tofficer, bearing His Majesty's\n\tcommission, can receive a glass of\n\twine on his nose, without resenting\n\tit -- fight you must, and Best is a\n\thuge, strong fellow.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tHe'll give the better mark.  I am\n\tnot afraid of him.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tIn faith, I believe you are not; for\n\ta lad I never saw more game in my\n\tlife.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy.\n\tYou're after my own soul.  As long\n\tas Jack Grogan lives, you shall\n\tnever want a friend or a second.\n\nThey embrace.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tPoor fellow!  He was shot six months\n\tafterwards, at Minden, and I lost\n\tthereby a kind friend.  But we don't\n\tknow what is in store for us, and\n\tthat's a blessing.\n\nEXT.  HOUSE - LATE DAY\n\nMother greeting Roderick and Captain Grogan.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tIn spite of my precautions to\n\tsecrecy, I half-suspected that my\n\tmother knew all from the manner in\n\twhich she embraced me on my arrival,\n\tand received our guest, Captain\n\tGrogan.\n\nHis mother looks a little anxious and flushed and, every\nnow and then, gazes very hard into the Captain's face.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tBut she would not say a word about\n\tthe quarrel, for she had a noble\n\tspirit, and would as lief have seen\n\tany one of her kindred hanged as\n\tshirking from the field of honor.\n\nINT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\nRoderick waking up.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI never slept sounder in my life,\n\tthough I woke a little earlier than\n\tusual, and you may be sure my first\n\tthought was of the event of the day,\n\tfor which I was fully prepared.\n\nRoderick at table with paper and ink.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAnd now I sat down and wrote a\n\tcouple of letters; they might be the\n\tlast, thought I, that I should ever\n\twrite in my life.\n\nSee him write:  \"Dearest Mother.\"\n\nINT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tThen I went down to breakfast, where\n\tmy mother was waiting for me, you\n\tmay be sure.  We did not say a\n\tsingle word about what was taking\n\tplace.\n\nRoderick eats his breakfast with a good appetite; but in\nhelping himself to salt, spills it, on which his mother\nstarts up with a scream.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER\n\tThank God, it's fallen towards me!\n\nAnd then, her heart being too full, she leaves the room.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAh!  They have their faults, those\n\tmothers; but are there any other\n\twomen like them?\n\nThere is an elegant, silver-mounted sword that hangs on\nthe mantelpiece under the picture of Roderick's late\nfather.\n\nA pair of pistols hang on each side of the picture.\n\nRoderick takes down the sword and pistols, which are\nbright and well-oiled, and collects flints, balls and\ngunpowder.\n\nEXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nCaptain Grogan and Orderly arrive.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tHave you taken my message to him?\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tThe meeting is arranged.  Captain\n\tBest is waiting for you now.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tMy mare is saddled and ready; who's\n\tthe captain's second?\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tYour cousins go out with him.\n\nRoderick and Grogan, and the Orderly ride off.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI didn't take leave of Mrs. James.\n\tThe curtains of her bedroom-windows\n\twere down, and they didn't move as\n\twe mounted and trotted off.\n\nEXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY\n\nThey ride their horses at a leisurely pace.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tThat's a very handsome sword you\n\thave there.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tIt was with this sword that my late\n\tfather, Harry James, God rest his\n\tsoul, met Sir Huddelstone\n\tFuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet,\n\tand was fatally run through the\n\tneck.  He was quite in the wrong,\n\thaving insulted Lady Fuddelstone,\n\twhen in liquor, at the Brentford\n\tAssembly.  But, like a gentleman, he\n\tscorned to apologize.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tAnd now you risk the same fate.  If\n\tyou are killed, your mother is all\n\talone in the world.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI am Harry James' son, and will act\n\tas becomes my name and quality.\n\nEXT.  FOREST CLEARING - DAY\n\nHarry, Michael and the Captain are already there.  Best,\nflaming in red regimentals, a big a monster as ever led a\ngrenadier company.  The party are laughing together.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (to Captain Grogan)\n\tI hope to spoil this sport, and\n\ttrust to see this sword of mine in\n\tthat big bully's body.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tOh, it's with pistols we fight.  You\n\tare no match for Best with the\n\tsword.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI'll match any man with the sword.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tBut swords are today impossible;\n\tCaptain Best is -- is lame.  He\n\tknocked his knee against the\n\tswinging park gate last night, as he\n\twas riding home, and can scarce move\n\tit now.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tNot against Castle Dugan gate, that\n\thas been off the hinges these ten\n\tyears.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tIt must have been some other gate.\n\nThey alight from their horses, and join and salute the\nother gentlemen.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tI have just explained to Mister\n\tJames that Captain Best is lame, and\n\tthat swords are impossible.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\tOh, yes!  Dead lame.\n\nHarry comes up to shake Roderick by the hand, while\nCaptain Best takes off his hat, and turns extremely red.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\tAnd very lucky for you, Roderick, my\n\tboy.  You were a dead man else, for\n\the is a devil of a fellow -- isn't\n\the, Grogan?\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tA regular Turk.  I never yet knew\n\tthe man who stood to Captain Best.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\tHang the business.  I hate it.  I'm\n\tashamed of it.  Say you're sorry,\n\tRoderick.  You can easily say that.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n\tIf the young feller will go to\n\tDublin, as proposed...\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI'm not sorry -- I'll not apologize\n\t-- and I'll as soon go to Dublin as\n\tto hell!\n\nGrogan takes him aside.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tLook here, Roderick, my boy; this is\n\tsilly business.  The girl will marry\n\tBest, mark my words; and as sure as\n\tshe does, you'll forget her.  You\n\tare but a boy.  Best is willing to\n\tconsider you as such.  Dublin's a\n\tfine place, and if you have a mind\n\tto take a ride thither and see the\n\ttown for a month, here are twenty\n\tguineas at your service.  Make Best\n\tan apology, and be off.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tA man of honor dies, but never\n\tapologizes.  I'll see the captain\n\thanged before I apologize.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\t\t   (with a laugh to\n\t\t    Grogan)\n\tThere's nothing else for it.  Take\n\tyour ground, Grogan -- twelve paces,\n\tI suppose?\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN BEST\n\t\t   (in a big voice)\n\tTen, sir, and make them short ones,\n\tdo you hear, Captain Grogan?\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\tDon't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the\n\tpistols.\n\t\t   (with some emotion\n\t\t    to Roderick)\n\tGod bless you, my boy; and when I\n\tcount three, fire.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tThis is not one of my pistols.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\tThey are all right, never fear.\n\tIt's one of mine.  Yours will serve,\n\tif they are needed, for the next\n\tround.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tRoderick, fire at his neck -- hit\n\thim there under the gorget; see how\n\tthe fool shows himself open.\n\nMichael, who has not spoken a word, Harry, and the Captain\nretire to one side, and Harry gives the signal.\n\nIt is slowly given, and Roderick has the leisure to cover\nhis man well.\n\nCaptain Best changes color and trembles as the numbers are\ngiven.\n\nAt \"three\" both pistols go off.  Best gives a most\nhorrible groan, staggers backwards and falls.\n\n\t\t\tTHE SECONDS\n\t\t   (crying out)\n\tHe's down!  He's down!\n\nRunning towards him, Harry lifts him up -- Michael takes\nhis head.\n\n\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\tHe's hit here, in the neck.\n\nLaying open his coat, blood is seen gurgling from under\nhis gorget.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\tHow is it with you?\n\nThe unfortunate man does not answer, but when the support\nof Harry's arm is withdrawn from his back, groans once\nmore and falls backwards.\n\n\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\t\t   (with a scowl)\n\tThe young fellow has begun well.\n\tYou had better ride off, young sir,\n\tbefore the police are up.  They had\n\twind of the business before we left\n\tKilwangan.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tIs he quite dead?\n\n\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\tQuite dead.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tThen the world's rid of a coward.\n\tIt's all over with him, Roddy -- he\n\tdoesn't stir.\n\nHe gives the huge prostrate body a scornful kick with his\nfoot.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\tWe are not cowards, Grogan, whatever\n\the was!  Let's get the boy off as\n\tquick as we may.  Your man shall go\n\tfor a cart, and take away the body\n\tof this unhappy gentleman.  This has\n\tbeen a sad day's work for our\n\tfamily, Roderick James, and you have\n\trobbed us of fifteen-hundred a-year.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tIt was Dorothy did it.\n\nRoderick takes the ribbons she gave him out of his\nwaistcoat, and the letter, and flings them down on the\nbody of Captain Best.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tThere!  Take her those ribbons.\n\tShe'll know what they mean; that's\n\tall that's left of her of two lovers\n\tshe had and ruined.\n\n\t\t\tMICHAEL\n\tAnd now, in Heaven's name, get the\n\tyoungster out of the way.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\tI'll go with you.\n\nThey mount up and gallop off.\n\nEXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nUpon seeing Roderick and Harry ride up, his mother, who\nhas been waiting outside, rushes to her son with wild\nscreams of joy.  He dismounts, and she kisses and embraces\nhim.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI need not tell you how great was my\n\tmother's pride and exultation when\n\tshe heard from Harry's lips the\n\taccount of my behavior at the duel.\n\nINT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - PARLOR - DAY\n\nStill much excitement and hustle and bustle.\n\n\t\t\tHARRY\n\tThe boy must go into hiding, for a\n\tshort time anyway.  Dublin is the\n\tbest place for him to go, and there\n\twait until matters are blown over.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER\n\tDublin?  But the poor lad has never\n\tbeen away from home.

MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nRoderick's departure.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tShe hurried my departure now, though\n\ther heart, I know, was full, and\n\talmost in half-an-hour from my\n\tarrival at home, I was once more on\n\tthe road again, with the wide world,\n\tas it were, before me.\n\nRoderick waves.  His mother cries.\n\nEXT.  HIGH ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tNo lad of seventeen is very sad who\n\thas liberty for the first time, and\n\ttwenty guineas in his pocket; and I\n\trode away, thinking, I confess, not\n\tso much of the kind of mother left\n\talone, and of the home behind me, as\n\tof tomorrow, and all the wonders it\n\twould bring.\n\nRoderick happily riding down the road.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI had no doubts of the future;\n\tthinking that a man of my person,\n\tparts, and courage, could make his\n\tway anywhere.  So I rode on, singing\n\tto myself, or chatting with the\n\tpassersby; and all the girls along\n\tthe road said, \"God save me, for a\n\tclever gentleman.\"\n\nFarm girls in the fields flirting with him.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAs for thoughts of Dorothy Dugan,\n\tthere seemed to be a gap of a half-\n\ta-score of years.\n\nEXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY\n\nA well-armed gentleman dressed in green, and a gold cord,\nwith a patch on his eye, and riding a powerful mare, puts\nhis horse alongside.\n\n\t\t\tARMED GENTLEMAN\n\tGood day to you, young sir.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tGood morning.\n\n\t\t\tARMED GENTLEMAN\n\tWhere are you bound for?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (after a long look at\n\t\t    his companion)\n\tThat is none of your business.\n\n\t\t\tARMED GENTLEMAN\n\tIs your mother not afraid on account\n\tof the highwayman to let one so\n\tyoung as you travel?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (pulling out a\n\t\t    pistol)\n\tNot at all, sir.

ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tA little later on, as I rode towards\n\tKilcullen, I saw a crowd of peasant\n\tpeople assembled round a one-horse\n\tchair, and my friend in green, as I\n\tthought, making off half-a-mile up\n\tthe hill.\n\nA footman howls, at the top of his voice.\n\n\t\t\tFOOTMAN\n\tStop thief!\n\nBut the country fellows only laugh at his distress, and\nmake all sorts of jokes at the adventure which had just\nbefallen.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTRY FELLOW #1\n\tSure, you might have kept him off\n\twith your blunderbush!\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTRY FELLOW #2\n\tO the coward!

O'REILLY\n\tOh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am\n\tthe wife of Captain O'Reilly\n\thastening to join him at Dublin.  My\n\tchair was stopped by a highwayman;\n\tthis great oaf of a servant-man fell\n\tdown on his knees, armed as he was,\n\tand though there were thirty people\n\tin the next field, working, when the\n\truffian attacked, not one of them\n\twould help but, on the contrary,\n\twished him \"good luck.\"\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTRY FELLOW #1\n\tSure, he's the friend of the poor,\n\tand good luck to him.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTRY FELLOW #2\n\tWas it any business of ours?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (shouting)\n\tBe off to your work, you pack of\n\trascals, or you will have a good\n\ttaste of my thong.\n\t\t   (to Mrs. O'Reilly)\n\tHave you lost much?\n\n\t\t\tMRS.

INN - DAY\n\nRoderick and Mrs. O'Reilly finishing their meal.\n\nWe will hear dialogue underneath Roderick's voice over.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tHow different was her lively rattle\n\tto the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan\n\tassemblies.  In every sentence, she\n\tmentioned a lord or a person of\n\tquality.  To the lady's question\n\tabout my birth and parentage, I\n\treplied that I was a young gentleman\n\tof large fortune, that I was going\n\tto Dublin for my studies, and that\n\tmy mother allowed me five hundred\n\tper annum.\n\n\t\t\tMRS. O'REILLY\n\tYou must be very cautious with\n\tregard to the company you should\n\tmeet in Dublin, where rogues and\n\tadventurers of all countries abound.\n\tI hope you will do me the honor of\n\taccepting lodgings in my own house,\n\twhere Captain O'Reilly will welcome\n\twith delight, my gallant young\n\tpreserver.\n\nPaying the bill.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tPerhaps had I been a little older in\n\tthe world's experience, I should\n\thave begun to see that Madame\n\tO'Reilly was not the person of\n\tfashion she pretended to be; but, as\n\tit was, I took all her stories for\n\ttruth, and, when the landlord\n\tbrought the bill for dinner, paid it\n\twith the air of a lord.  Indeed, she\n\tmade no motion to produce the two\n\tpieces I had lent her.\n\nEXT.  DUBLIN - STREET - NIGHT\n\nThey ride by.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAnd so we rode on slowly towards\n\tDublin, into which city we made our\n\tentrance at nightfall.  The rattle\n\tand splendor of the coaches, the\n\tflare of the linkboys, the number\n\tand magnificence of the houses,\n\tstruck me with the greatest wonder;\n\tthough I was careful to disguise\n\tthis feeling.\n\nEXT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - DUBLIN - NIGHT\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tWe stopped at length at a house of\n\trather mean appearance, and were let\n\tinto a passage which had a great\n\tsmell of supper and punch.\n\nINT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nCaptain O'Reilly, a stout red-faced man, without a\nperiwig, and in a rather tattered nightgown and cap.\nRoderick and Mrs. O'Reilly.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN O'REILLY\n\tMr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how\n\tgrateful I am for your timely\n\tassistance to my wife.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI am only sorry that I was unable to\n\tprevent the villain from carrying\n\toff all her ladyship's money and\n\tpearls.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN O'REILLY\n\tMr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt,\n\tand rest assured, sir, you have\n\tfriends in this house whenever you\n\tare in Dublin.\n\t\t   (pours a glass)\n\tMister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know\n\tyour good father?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tWhich O'Higgins do you know?  For I\n\thave never heard your name mentioned\n\tin my family.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN O'REILLY\n\tOh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins\n\tof Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins\n\twas a close friend of my wife's dear\n\tfather, Colonel Granby Somerset.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tAh -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine\n\tare the O'Higgins of Watertown.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN O'REILLY\n\tI have heard of them.\n\nThere are relics of some mutton-chops and onions on a\ncracked dish before them.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN O'REILLY\n\tMy love, I wish I had known of your\n\tcoming, for Bob Moriaty and I just\n\tfinished the most delicious venison\n\tpasty, which His Grace the Lord\n\tLieutenant, sent us, with a flash of\n\tsillery from his own cellar.  You\n\tknow the wine, my dear?  But as\n\tbygones are bygones, and no help for\n\tthem, what say ye to a fine lobster\n\tand a bottle of as good claret as\n\tany in Ireland?  Betty, clear these\n\tthings from the table, and make the\n\tmistress and our young friend\n\twelcome to our home.\n\nCaptain O'Reilly searches his pockets for some money to\ngive to Betty.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN O'REILLY\n\tI'm sorry, Mr. O'Higgins, but I\n\tdon't seem to have any small change.\n\tMay I borrow a ten-penny piece to\n\tgive to the girl?\n\n\t\t\tMRS. O'REILLY\n\tI have some money, my dear.  Here,\n\tBetty, go to the fishmonger and\n\tbring back our supper, and mind you\n\tget the right change.\n\nShe takes out one of the golden guineas Roderick gave to\nher.\n\nINT.  DINNING ROOM - LATER\n\nThey are eating.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tOur supper was seasoned, if not by\n\tany great elegance, at least by a\n\tplentiful store of anecdotes,\n\tconcerning the highest personages of\n\tthe city, with whom, according to\n\thimself, the captain lived on terms\n\tof the utmost intimacy.  Not to be\n\tbehind hand with him, I spoke of my\n\town estates and property as if I was\n\tas rich as a duke.\n\nINT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe couple wishing Roderick goodnight.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tHad I been an English lad, the\n\tappearance of the chamber I occupied\n\tmight, indeed, have aroused\n\tinstantly my suspicion and distrust.\n\tBut we are not particular in Ireland\n\ton the score of neatness, hence the\n\tdisorder of my bed-chamber did not\n\tstrike me so much.\n\nBroken door.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tWas there a lock to the door, or a\n\thasp to fasten it to?\n\nDress lying over bed.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tThough my counterpane was evidently\n\ta greased brocade dress of Mrs.\n\tO'Reilly.\n\nCracked mirror.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAnd my cracked toilet-glass not much\n\tbigger than a half-crown, yet I was\n\tused to these sort of ways in Irish\n\thouses, and still thought myself to\n\tbe in that of a man of fashion.\n\nDrawers, full of junk.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tThere was no lock to the drawers,\n\twhich, when they did open, were full\n\tof my hostess' rouge-pots, shoes,\n\tstays, and rags.\n\nINT.  BEDROOM - O'REILLY HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nIn the middle of the night, Mrs. O'Reilly comes to\nRoderick's room on a flimsy pretext, and in the course of\nevents, he has his first woman.\n\nINT.  COACH - DAY\n\nRoderick, Captain and Mrs. O'Reilly.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN O'REILLY\n\tI needn't ask whether you had a\n\tcomfortable bed.  Young Fred\n\tPimpleton slept in it for seven\n\tmonths, during which he did me the\n\thonor to stay with me, and if he was\n\tsatisfied, I don't know who else\n\twouldn't be.\n\nEXT.  PROMENADE - PHOENIX PARK - DAY\n\nRoderick, Captain and Mrs. O'Reilly, their friends.\nVarious cuts.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAfter breakfast, we drove out to\n\tPhoenix Park, where numbers of the\n\tyoung gentry were known to Mrs.\n\tO'Reilly, to all of whom she\n\tpresented me in such a complimentary\n\tway that, before half an hour, I had\n\tgot to be considered as a gentleman\n\tof great expectations and large\n\tproperty.\n\nINT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI had little notion then that I had\n\tgot amongst a set of impostors --\n\tthat Captain O'Reilly was only an\n\tadventurer, and his lady a person of\n\tno credit.  The fact was, a young\n\tman could hardly have fallen into\n\tworse hands than those in which I\n\tnow found myself.\n\nAn evening of gambling.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tTheir friends were always welcome on\n\tpayment of a certain moderate sum\n\tfor their dinner after which, you\n\tmay be sure, that cards were not\n\twanting, and that the company who\n\tplayed did not play for love merely.\n\nVarious cuts of the characters present.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tWhat could happen to a man but\n\tmisfortune from associating with\n\tsuch company?  And in a very, very\n\tshort time I became their prey.\n\nRoderick loses two hundred guineas to Captain O'Reilly in\na single hand.\n\nWe see Captain O'Reilly cheat, but Roderick does not.\n\nHe pays him the 18 gold guineas, remaining from the sum\nhis mother gave him.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI shall have to write out a note for\n\tthe rest of it, Captain O'Reilly.\n\nEXT.  STREET - OUTSIDE O'REILLY HOUSE - DAWN\n\nRoderick exits to the street.  The sound of the gambling\ncan still be heard in the street.  He is soon joined by\nCouncillor Mulligan.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNCILLOR MULLIGAN\n\tMaster Roderick, you appear a young\n\tfellow of birth and fortune; let me\n\twhisper in your ear that you have\n\tfallen into very bad hands -- it's a\n\tregular gang of swindlers; and a\n\tgentleman of your rank and quality\n\tshould never be seen in such\n\tcompany.  The captain has been a\n\tgentleman's gentleman, and his lady\n\tof no higher rank.  Go home, pack\n\tyour valise, pay the little trifle\n\tyou owe me, mount your mare, and\n\tride back again to your parents --\n\tit's the very best thing you can do.\n\nRoderick does not reply, and walks slowly away from him\ndown the street.\n\nINT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING\n\nRoderick enters.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tInto a pretty nest of villains,\n\tindeed, was I plunged!  When I\n\treturned to my bed-chamber, a few\n\thours later, it seemed as if all my\n\tmisfortunes were to break on me at\n\tonce.\n\nValise open, wardrobe lying on the ground, and Roderick's\nkeys in the possession of O'Reilly and his wife.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN O'REILLY\n\tWhom have I been harboring in my\n\thouse?  Who are you, sirrah?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tSirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a\n\tgentleman as any in Ireland!\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN O'REILLY\n\tYou're an impostor, young man, a\n\tschemer, a deceiver!\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tRepeat the words again, and I run\n\tyou through the body.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN O'REILLY\n\tTut, tut!  I can play at fencing as\n\twell as you, Mr. Roderick James.\n\tAh!  You change color, do you?  Your\n\tsecret is known, is it?  You come\n\tlike a viper into the bosom of\n\tinnocent families; you represent\n\tyourself as the heir to my friends\n\tthe O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I\n\tintroduce you to the nobility and\n\tgentry of this methropolis; I take\n\tyou to my tradesmen, who give you\n\tcredit.  I accept your note for near\n\ttwo hundred pounds, and what do I\n\tfind?  A fraud.\n\nHe holds up the name, Roderick James, printed on the\nlinen.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN O'REILLY\n\tNot Master O'Higgins of Watertown,\n\tbut Roderick James of the devil only\n\tknows where...\n\nCaptain O'Reilly gathers up the linen clothes, silver\ntoilet articles, and the rest of Roderick's gear.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tHark ye, Mr. O'Reilly, I will tell\n\tyou why I was obliged to alter my\n\tname, which is James and the best\n\tname in Ireland.  I changed it, sir,\n\tbecause, on the day before I came to\n\tDublin, I killed a man in deadly\n\tcombat -- an Englishman, sir, and a\n\tCaptain in His Majesty's service;\n\tand if you offer to let or hinder me\n\tin the slightest way, the same arm\n\twhich destroyed him is ready to\n\tpunish you.\n\nSo saying, Roderick draws his sword like lightning, and\ngiving a \"ha, ha!\" and a stamp with his foot, lunges it\nwithin an inch of O'Reilly's heart, who starts back and\nturns deadly pale, while his wife, with a scream, flings\nherself between them.\n\n\t\t\tMRS. O'REILLY\n\tDearest Roderick -- be pacified.\n\tO'Reilly, you don't want the poor\n\tchild's blood.  Let him escape -- in\n\tHeaven's name, let him go.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN O'REILLY\n\t\t   (sulkily)\n\tHe may go hang for me, and he's\n\tbetter be off quickly, for I shall\n\tgo to the magistrate if I see him\n\tagain.\n\nO'Reilly exits.  His wife sits down on the bed and begins\nto cry.\n\nEXT.  DUBLIN STREET - DAY\n\nRoderick riding down the street, with his valise.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tWhere was now a home for the\n\tdescendant of the James?  I was\n\texpelled from Dublin by a\n\tpersecution occasioned, I must\n\tconfess, by my own imprudence.  I\n\thad no time to wait and choose.  No\n\tplace of refuge to fly to.\n\nINT.  ALE HOUSE - DAY\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tThere was a score of recruiting\n\tparties in the town beating up for\n\tmen to join our gallant armies in\n\tAmerica and Germany.\n\nRoderick approaches a Captain and a Sergeant, who quickly\nmake him welcome.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI will tell you frankly, sir.  I am\n\ta young gentleman in difficulties; I\n\thave killed an officer in a duel,\n\tand I am anxious to get out of the\n\tcountry.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tBut I needn't have troubled myself\n\twith any explanations; King George\n\twas in too much want of men to heed\n\tfrom whence they came -- and a\n\tfellow of my inches was always\n\twelcome.  Indeed, I could not have\n\tchosen my time better.  A transport\n\twas lying at Dunleary, waiting for a\n\twind.\n\nEXT.  BRITISH WARSHIP AT SEA - DAY\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI never had a taste for any thing\n\tbut genteel company, and hate all\n\tdescriptions of low life.  Hence my\n\taccount of the society in which I at\n\tpresent found myself must of\n\tnecessity be short.  The\n\treminiscences of the horrid black-\n\thole of a place in which we soldiers\n\twere confined, of the wretched\n\tcreatures with whom I was now forced\n\tto keep company, of the plowmen,\n\tpoachers, pickpockets, who had taken\n\trefuge from poverty, or the law, as,\n\tin truth, I had done myself, is\n\tenough to make me ashamed even now.\n\nRoderick sits very disconsolately over a platter of rancid\nbacon and moldy biscuit, which is served to him at mess.\nWhen it comes to his turn to be helped to drink, he is\nserved, like the rest, with dirty tin noggin, containing\nsomewhat more than half a pint of rum and water.  The\nbeaker is so greasy and filthy that he cannot help turning\nround to the messman and saying:\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tFellow, get me a glass!\n\nAt which, all the wretches round him burst into a roar of\nlaughter, the very loudest among them being Mr. Toole, a\nred-haired monster of a man.\n\n\t\t\tMR. TOOLE\n\tGet the gentleman a towel for his\n\thands, and serve him a basin of\n\tturtle-soup.\n\nRoars the monster, who is sitting, or rather squatting, on\nthe deck opposite him, and as he speaks, he suddenly\nseizes Roderick's beaker of grog and empties it in midst\nof another burst of applause.\n\n\t\t\tLINK-BOY\n\t\t   (whispers)\n\tIf you want to vex him, ask him\n\tabout his wife, the washerwoman, who\n\tbates him.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tIs it a towel of your wife's\n\twashing, Mr. Toole?  I'm told she\n\twiped your face often with one.\n\n\t\t\tLINK-BOY\n\t\t   (whispers)\n\tAsk him why he wouldn't see her\n\tyesterday, when she came to the\n\tship.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAnd so I put to him some other\n\tfoolish jokes about soapsuds, hen-\n\tpecking, and flat-irons, which set\n\tthe man into a fury, and succeeded\n\tin raising a quarrel between us.\n\nRoderick and Toole fight with cudgels.  Roderick gives him\na thump across his head which lays him lifeless on the\nfloor.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tThis victory over the cock of the\n\tvile dunghill obtained me respect\n\tamong the wretches among whom I\n\tformed part.\n\nEXT.  MILITARY DRILL FIELD - CUXHAVEN - DAY\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tOur passage was very favorable, and\n\tin two days we landed at Cuxhaven,\n\tand before I had been a month in the\n\tElectorate, I was transported into a\n\ttall and proper young soldier, and,\n\thaving a natural aptitude for\n\tmilitary exercise, was soon as\n\taccomplished at the drill as the\n\toldest sergeant in the regiment.\n\nVarious cuts.\n\nRoderick learning the soldierly arts, musket drill, manual\nof arms, bayonet, marching.\n\nEXT.  MILITARY COURTYARD - CUXHAVEN - DAY\n\nThe Cuxhaven troops are drawn up to receive a new\nregiment, arrived from England.\n\nRoderick sees, marching at the head of his company, his\nold friend, Captain Grogan, who gives him a wink.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tSix weeks after we arrived in\n\tCuxhaven, we were reinforced by\n\tGales regiment of foot from England,\n\tand I promise you the sight of\n\tGrogan's face was most welcome to\n\tme, for it assured me that a friend\n\twas near me.\n\nINT.  GROGAN'S QUARTERS - DAY\n\nRoderick and Grogan.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tGrogan gave me a wink of\n\trecognition, but offered no public\n\ttoken of acquaintance and it was not\n\tuntil two days afterwards that he\n\tcalled me into his quarters, and\n\tthen, shaking hands with me\n\tcordially, gave me news which I\n\twanted, of my family.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tI had news of you in Dublin.  Faith,\n\tyou've begun early, like your\n\tfather's son, but I think you could\n\tnot do better than as you have done.\n\tBut why did you not write home to\n\tyour poor mother?  She has sent\n\thalf-a-dozen letters to you in\n\tDublin.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI suppose she addressed them to me\n\tin my real name, by which I never\n\tthought to ask for them at the post\n\toffice.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tWe must write to her today, and you\n\tcan tell her that you are safe and\n\tmarried to \"Brown Bess.\"\n\nRoderick sighs when Grogan says the word \"married,\" on\nwhich Grogan says with a laugh:\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tI see you are thinking of a certain\n\tyoung lady at Duganstown.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tIs Miss Dugan well?\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tThere's only six Miss Dugans now...\n\tpoor Dorothy.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tGood heavens!  Whatever?  Has she\n\tdied of grief?\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tShe took on so at your going away\n\tthat she was obliged to console\n\therself with a husband.  She is now\n\tMrs. John Best.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tMrs. John Best!  Was there another\n\tMr. John Best?!\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tNo, the very same one, my boy.  He\n\trecovered from his wound.  The ball\n\tyou hit him with was not likely to\n\thurt him.  It was only made of tow.\n\tDo you think the Dugans would let\n\tyou kill fifteen hundred a-year out\n\tof the family?  The plan of the duel\n\twas all arranged in order to get you\n\tout of the way, for the cowardly\n\tEnglishman could never be brought to\n\tmarry from fear of you.  But hit him\n\tyou certainly did, Roderick, and\n\twith a fine thick plugget of tow,\n\tand the fellow was so frightened\n\tthat he was an hour in coming to.\n\tWe told your mother the story\n\tafterwards, and a pretty scene she\n\tmade.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tThe coward!\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tHe has paid off your uncle's\n\tmortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach-\n\tand-six.  That coward of a fellow\n\thas been making of your uncle's\n\tfamily.  Faith, the business was\n\twell done.  Your cousins, Michael\n\tand Harry, never let him out of\n\ttheir sight, though he was for\n\tdeserting to England, until the\n\tmarriage was completed, and the\n\thappy couple off on their road to\n\tDublin.  Are you in want of cash, my\n\tboy?  You may draw upon me, for I got\n\ta couple of hundred out of Master\n\tBest for my share and, while they\n\tlast, you shall never want.\n\nEXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - BRITISH ON THE MARCH - DAY\n\nRoderick on the march.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tOur regiment, which was quartered\n\tabout Stade and Luneberg, speedily\n\thad got orders to march southwards\n\ttowards the Rhine, where we would\n\tfight the famous battle of Minden.\n\tIt would require a greater\n\tphilosopher and historian than I am\n\tto explain the causes of the famous\n\tSeven Years' War in which Europe was\n\tengaged, and, indeed, its origin has\n\talways appeared to me to be so\n\tcomplicated, and the books written\n\tabout it so amazingly hard to\n\tunderstand, that I have seldom been\n\tmuch wiser at the end of a chapter\n\tthan at the beginning, and so shall\n\tnot trouble you with any personal\n\tdisquisitions concerning the matter.\n\nVarious cuts featuring Roderick; marching, cooking at open\nfires, gambling, resting in a farm yard, officers riding\nby; shivering in his blanket.\n\nEXT.  BATTLEFIELD OF MINDEN - BATTLE FRAGMENT - DAY\n\nRoderick and his company.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tWere these memoirs not characterized\n\tby truth, I might easily make myself\n\tthe hero of some strange and popular\n\tadventures.\n\nEXT.  MINDEN - BATTLE FRAGMENTS - DAY\n\nOfficers ride by in smoke.  Troops marching to the attack.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tBut I saw no one of the higher ranks\n\tthat day than my colonel and a\n\tcouple of orderly officers riding by\n\tin the smoke -- no one on our side,\n\tthat is.  A poor corporal is not\n\tgenerally invited into the company\n\tof commanders and the great.\n\nRoderick advancing.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tBut, in revenge, I saw, I promise\n\tyou, some very good company on the\n\tFrench part, for their regiments of\n\tLorraine and Royal Cravate were\n\tcharging us all day; and in the sort\n\tof melee high and low are pretty\n\tequally received.  I hate bragging,\n\tbut I cannot help saying that I made\n\ta very close acquaintance with the\n\tcolonel of the Cravates.\n\nRoderick firing his musket.  He bayonets a French colonel,\namidst shouts and curses.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAnd finished off a poor little\n\tensign, so young, slender, and\n\tsmall, that a blow from my pigtail\n\twould have dispatched him.\n\nRoderick kills a French ensign with a blows from the butt\nof his musket.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAnd in the poor ensign's pocket\n\tfound a purse of fourteen louis\n\td'or, and a silver box of sugar-\n\tplums, of which the former present\n\twas very agreeable to me.\n\nRoderick taking money and the box of sugar-plums from the\nensign.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tIf people would tell their stories\n\tof battles in this simple way, I\n\tthink the cause of truth would not\n\tsuffer by it.  All I know of this\n\tfamous fight of Minden, except from\n\tbooks, is told here above.\n\nCaptain Grogan is shot, cries out, and falls.\n\nA brother captain turns to Lieutenant Lakenham.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN\n\tGrogan's down; Lakenham, there's\n\tyour company.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tThat was all the epitaph my brave\n\tpatron got.\n\nRoderick kneels above Grogan.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GROGAN\n\tI should have left you a hundred\n\tguineas, Roderick, but for a cursed\n\trun of ill-luck last night at faro.\n\nHe gives Roderick a faint squeeze of the hand; and, as the\nword is given to advance, Roderick leaves him.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tWhen we came back to our ground,\n\twhich we presently did, he was lying\n\tstill, but he was dead.  Some of our\n\tpeople had already torn off his\n\tepaulets, and, no doubt, had rifled\n\this purse.\n\nEXT.  VARIOUS ROUGH RURAL LOCATIONS - DAY\n\nShort cuts to voice over.\n\nRoderick and British troops rape, pillage and burn.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAfter the death of my protector,\n\tCaptain Grogan, I am forced to\n\tconfess that I fell into the very\n\tworst of courses and company.  In a\n\tforeign country, with the enemy\n\tbefore us, and the people\n\tcontinually under contribution from\n\tone side or the other, numberless\n\tirregularities were permitted to the\n\ttroops.  It is well for gentlemen to\n\ttalk of the age of chivalry; but\n\tremember the starving brutes whom\n\tthey lead -- men nursed in poverty,\n\tentirely ignorant, made to take\n\tpride in deeds of blood -- men who\n\tcan have no amusement but in\n\tdrunkenness, debauch, and plunder.\n\tIt is with these shocking\n\tinstruments that your great warriors\n\tand kings have been doing their\n\tmurderous work in the world.\n\nEXT.

I will\n\tpay you five guineas if you will\n\tcarry me into the town which is hard\n\tby those woods.\n\nRoderick and another man take him up in a cloak, and carry\nhim towards the nearby town of Warburg.\n\nEXT.  A FARMHOUSE - GERMAN STREET - WARBURG - DAY\n\nIn order to get into the house, Roderick and the other man\nare obliged to fire into the locks with their pieces,\nwhich summons brings the inhabitants of the house to the\ndoor; a very pretty and black-eyed, young woman, and her\nold, half-blinded father.\n\nThey are at first unwilling to accommodate the guest, but\nMr. Lakenham, speaking to them in German, and taking a\ncouple of guineas out of a very full purse, speedily\nconvinces the people that they have only to deal with a\nperson of honor.\n\nINT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY\n\nThey carry Lieutenant Lakenham to bed and receive their\nfive guineas.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tWe put the patient to bed, and he\n\tpaid me the stipulated reward.  A\n\tyoung surgeon, who desired nothing\n\tbetter than to take himself out of\n\tthe fire of the musketry, came\n\tpresently to dress the wound.\n\nIn his German jargon, Roderick pays some deserved\ncompliments to the black-eyed beauty of Warburg, thinking,\nwith no small envy, how comfortable it would be to be\nbilleted there.\n\nEXT.  STREET - WARBURG - OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE - DAY\n\nHe starts back to the regiment, with his comrade, when the\nman interrupts his reverie by suggesting they divide the\nfive guineas.\n\n\t\t\tPRIVATE\n\tI should get half.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tYour share is one guinea.\n\nRoderick gives him one guinea.\n\n\t\t\tPRIVATE\n\tHe gave you five guineas, and I\n\tbloody well expect half.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tGo to the devil.\n\nThe private lifting his musket, hits Roderick a blow with\nthe butt-end of it, which sends him stunned to the ground,\nallowing his comrade to take the other four guineas from\nhis pocket.\n\nRecovering his senses, Roderick bleeding, with a large\nwound in the head, has barely time to stagger back to the\nhouse where he had just left the lieutenant, when he\nfalls fainting at the door, just as the surgeon exits.\n\nINT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY\n\nRoderick is carried by the surgeon and the black-eyed\ngirl, into another bed in the room where the Lieutenant\nhas been laid.\n\n\t\t\tLAKENHAM\n\t\t   (languidly, in pain)\n\tWho are you putting into that bed?\n\n\t\t\tLISCHEN\n\tWe have the Corporal, wounded, to\n\tyou bringing.\n\n\t\t\tLAKENHAM\n\tA corporal?  Turn him out.  Schicken\n\tsie Herrn Koporal weg!\n\nINT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT AND DAY\n\nLischen brings Roderick a refreshing drink; and, as he\ntakes it, he presses the kind hand that gave it to him;\nnor does this token of his gratitude seem unwelcome.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI found Lischen the tenderest of\n\tnurses.  Whenever any delicacy was\n\tto be provided for the wounded\n\tlieutenant, a share was always sent\n\tto the bed opposite his, and to the\n\tavaricious man's no small annoyance.\n\nLischen serving food.\n\nVarious cuts, representing different days.\n\nLakenham behaving as rottenly as Roderick describes:\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tNor was I the only person in the\n\thouse to whom the worthy gentleman\n\twas uncivil.  He ordered the fair\n\tLischen hither and thither, made\n\timpertinent love to her, abused her\n\tsoups, quarreled with her\n\tomelettes, and grudged the money\n\twhich was laid out for his\n\tmaintenance, so that our hostess\n\tdetested him as much as, I think,\n\twithout vanity, as she regarded me.\n\nRoderick making lover to Lischen while Lieutenant Lakenham\nsulks in the next bed.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tFor if truth must be told, I had\n\tmade very deep love to her during my\n\tstay under her roof, as is always my\n\tway with women, of whatever age or\n\tdegree of beauty.  Do not think me\n\tvery cruel and heartless, ladies;\n\tthis heart of Lischen's was like\n\tmany a town, which had been stormed\n\tand occupied several times before I\n\tcame to invest it,\n\nRoderick sitting up in bed.  Lischen has just served him\nhis supper.\n\nEnter a British officer, an aide who carries a notebook,\nand a surgeon.  In a brief scene to be written, we learn\nthat a sudden movement on the part of the French requires\nthe British army to follow them.  The town is to be\nevacuated, except for some Prussian line-of-communication\ntroops, whose surgeons are to visit the wounded in the\nplace; and, when they are well, they are to be drafted to\ntheir regiments.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI began to reflect how pleasant my\n\tquarters were to me, and that I was\n\tmuch better here than crawling under\n\tan odious tent with a parcel of\n\ttipsy soldiers, or going the night-\n\trounds, or rising long before\n\tdaybreak for drill.  I determined\n\tthat I never would join mine again.\n\nEXT.  VIEW OUT OF WARBURG FARMHOUSE WINDOW - DAY\n\nRoderick stands by the window, watching English troops and\nwagons leaving the town.\n\nINT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY\n\nRoderick walks into Lakenham's room attired in his full\nregimentals, and with his hat cocked over his left eye.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI'm promoted Lieutenant.  I've come\n\tto take my leave of you.  I intend\n\tto have your papers and purse.\n\n\t\t\tLAKENHAM\n\tYou great scoundrel!  You mutinous\n\tdog!  What do you mean by dressing\n\tyourself in my regimentals?  As sure\n\tas my name's Lakenham, when we get\n\tback to the regiment, I'll have your\n\tsoul cut out of your body.\n\nWith this, Roderick puts his hand under his pillow, at\nwhich Lakenham gives a scream that might have called the\nwhole garrison about his ears.\n\nRoderick threatens him with a knife at his throat.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tHark ye, sir!  No more noise, or you\n\tare a dead man!\n\nRoderick, taking his handkerchief, binds it tight round\nhis mouth, and, pulling forward the sleeves of his shirt,\nties them in a knot together, and so leaves him, removing\nthe papers and the purse, and wishing him politely a good\nday.\n\nEXT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - STREET - DAY\n\nLischen, waiting outside the house, with a saddled horse,\nthrows her arms around him, and makes the tenderest adieu.\n\nRoderick mounts his newly-purchased animal, waves his hat\ngallantly, and, prances away down the street.\n\nEXT.  ROAD - DAY\n\nRoderick happily riding along a wooded country road,\nrounds a blind bend and sees suddenly before him, about\ntwo hundred yards away, a company of Prussian infantry\nresting along the sides of the road, together with a dozen\nmounted dragoons.\n\nA quick calculation tells him that is is better to proceed\nthan to turn back, and he rides into their midst,\napproaching a group of officers.\n\nHe presents himself as Lieutenant Lakenham and asks for\ndirections to join his regiment.  He is told that he is\nriding in the wrong direction, and is shown a map.\n\nDuring the explanation, Captain Galgenstein approaches\nwith an open, smiling countenance, introduces himself, and\nsays he, too, is bound for the same place, and asks if\nRoderick will honor him with his company.\n\nTo avoid suspicion, Roderick readily accepts the offer,\nand the two men mount up, and ride off together.\n\nEXT.  ROAD - GERMANY - DAY\n\nRoderick and Galgenstein riding together.\n\nDialogue under voice over.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tMy companion treated me with great\n\tcivility, and asked me a thousand\n\tquestions about England, which I\n\tanswered as best I might.  But this\n\tbest, I am bound to say, was bad\n\tenough.  I knew nothing about\n\tEngland, and I invented a thousand\n\tstories which I told him; described\n\tthe king and the ministers to him,\n\tsaid the British ambassador in\n\tBerlin was my uncle, and promised my\n\tacquaintance a letter of\n\trecommendation to him.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\tWhat is your uncle's name?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (slowly)\n\tO'Grady.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\t\t   (with a laugh)\n\tOh, yes, of course, Ambassador\n\tO'Grady...\n\nEXT.

Their horses' heads\ntogether, jogging on.\n\nThey pass a party of recruits under the armed guard of a\nred-coated Hanoverian sergeant.\n\nHe exchanges signs of recognition with Captain\nGalgenstein.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\tIt hurts my feelings to be obliged\n\tto commune with such wretches, but\n\tthe stern necessities of war demand\n\tmen continually, and hence these\n\trecruiters whom you see market in\n\thuman flesh.  They get five-and-\n\ttwenty thaler a man from our\n\tgovernment for every man they bring\n\tin.  For fine men -- for men like\n\tyou.\n\t\t   (he adds laughing)\n\tThey would go as high as hundred.\n\nEXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nRoderick and Captain Galgenstein approach a very lonely-\nlooking place.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\tThis is a very good inn.  Shall we\n\tstop for dinner?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tThis may be a very good inn for\n\tGermany, but it would not pass in\n\told Ireland.  Corbach is only a\n\tleague off, let us push on for\n\tCorbach.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\tDo you want to see the loveliest\n\twoman in Europe?\n\nRoderick smiles.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\tAh!  You sly rogue, I see that will\n\tinfluence you.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tThe place seems more a farm than an\n\tinn-yard.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\tThe people are great farmers, as\n\twell as inn-keepers.\n\nThey enter by a great gate into a court, walled round, and\nat on end of which is the building, a dingy ruinous place.\n\nA couple of covered wagons are in the courtyard; their\nhorses are littered under a shed hard by.\n\nLounging about the place are some men, and a pair of\nsergeants in the Prussian uniform, who both touch their\nhats to the captain.\n\nThe inn has something foreboding about it, and the men\nshut the great yard-gates as soon as they enter.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\t\t   (explaining the gate)\n\tParties of French horsemen are about\n\tthe country, and one cannot take too\n\tmany precautions against such\n\tvillains.\n\nThe two sergeant take charge of the horses; the captain\norders one of them to take Roderick's valise to his\nbedroom.\n\nRoderick promises the sergeant a glass of schnapps for his\npains.\n\nThey enter into supper.\n\nINT.  GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nA dish of fried eggs and bacon is ordered from a hideous\nold wench that comes to serve them, in place of the lovely\ncreature which had been expected; and the captain,\nlaughing, says:\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\tWell, our meal is a frugal one, but\n\ta soldier has many a time a worse.\n\nTaking off his hat, sword-belt, and gloves, with great\nceremony, Galgenstein sits down to eat.  Roderick puts his\nweapons securely on the old chest of drawers where the\ncaptain's is laid.\n\nThe hideous old woman brings in a pot of very sour wine,\nat which, and at her ugliness, Roderick feels a\nconsiderable ill-humor.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (when she leaves)\n\tWhere's the beauty you promised me?\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\t\t   (laughing and looking\n\t\t    hard at Roderick)\n\tIt was my joke.  I was tired, and\n\tdid not care to go farther.  There's\n\tnot prettier woman here than that.\n\tIf she won't suit your fancy, my\n\tfriend, then you must wait awhile.\n\nThis increases Roderick's ill-humor.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (sternly)\n\tUpon my word, sir, I think you have\n\tacted very coolly.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\tI have acted as I think fit.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tSir, I'm a British officer.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\tIt's a lie!  You're a deserter!\n\tYou're an impostor, sir; Your lies\n\tand folly have confirmed this to me.\n\tYou pretend to carry dispatches to a\n\tgeneral who has been dead these ten\n\tmonths; you have an uncle who is an\n\tambassador and whose name you don't\n\tknow.  Will you join and take the\n\tbounty, sir, or will you be given\n\tup?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tNeither!\n\nSpringing at him like a tiger.\n\nBut, agile as he is, Galgenstein is equally on his guard.\nHe takes two pistols out of his pockets, fires one off,\nand says, from the other end of the table where he stands\ndodging Roderick, as it were.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\tAdvance a step, and I send this\n\tbullet into your brains!\n\nThe door is flung open, and the two sergeants enter, armed\nwith musket and bayonet to aid their captain.\n\nThe game is up.  Roderick flings down a knife with which\nhe had armed himself, for the old hag, on bringing in the\nwine, had removed his sword.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI volunteer.\n\nEXT.

I have\n\tfallen into bad company, it is true;\n\tbut I have only done as other\n\tsoldiers have done; and, above all,\n\tI have never had a kind friend and\n\tprotector before, to whom I might\n\tshow that I was worthy of better\n\tthings.  The Colonel may say I am a\n\truined lad, and send me to the\n\tdevil; but be sure of this, I would\n\tgo to the devil to serve the\n\tregiment.\n\nCaptain Galgenstein looks pleased with Roderick's\nperformance.\n\nBERLIN - 1763\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tSoon after the war ended, our\n\tregiment was garrisoned in the\n\tcapital, the least dull, perhaps, of\n\tall the towns of Prussia; but that\n\tdoes not say much for its gaiety.\n\nINT.

Captain\n\tGalgenstein sent for me.\n\n\t\t\tPRUSSIAN SERGEANT\n\tYou may wait.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tThank you, sir.\n\nRoderick stands stiffly.  We can make out the sound of\nloud talking behind the closed door.\n\nEnter a private huffing and puffing.\n\n\t\t\tPRIVATE\n\tSergeant, the wagon has arrived with\n\tthe Captain's furniture, but the\n\tdriver says he is not supposed to\n\tunload it.  Is it possible for you\n\tto talk to him?\n\nExit the sergeant, muttering.  Roderick, now alone in the\noffice, walks closer to the door so that he can hear what\nis being said.\n\n\t\t\tMINISTER GALGENSTEIN (O.S.)\n\tGive him his discharge!  Bon Dieu!\n\tYou are a model of probity!  You'll\n\tnever succeed to my place, my dear\n\tnephew, if you are no wiser than you\n\tare just now.  Make the fellow as\n\tuseful to you as you please.  You\n\tsay he has a good manner and a frank\n\tcountenance, that he can lie with\n\tassurance, and fight, you say, on a\n\tpinch.  The scoundrel does not want\n\tfor good qualities.  As long as you\n\thave the regiment in terrorem over\n\thim, you can do as you like with\n\thim.  Once let him loose, and the lad\n\tis likely to give you the slip.\n\tKeep on promising him; promise to\n\tmake him a general, if you like.\n\tWhat the deuce do I care?  There are\n\tspies enough to be had in this town\n\twithout him.\n\nRoderick hears the sergeant returning and walks back to\nthe door.\n\nThen the office door opens, Captain Galgenstein looks out,\nsees Roderick, smiles and say:\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\tGood morning, Private James.  Please\n\tcome in.  I should like you to meet\n\tmy uncle, Herr Minister of Police\n\tGalgenstein.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tHow do you do, sir?\n\nThe Minister nods.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tThe captain was the nephew and heir\n\tof the Minister of Police, Herr\n\tGalgenstein, a relationship which,\n\tno doubt, aided in the younger\n\tgentlemen's promotion.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\tYour loyalty to me and your service\n\tto the regiment has pleased me very\n\twell -- and now there is another\n\toccasion on which you may make\n\tyourself useful to us; if you\n\tsucceed, depend on it, your reward\n\twill be your discharge from the\n\tarmy, and a bounty of 100 guineas.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tWhat is the service, sir?\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\tThere is lately come to Berlin a\n\tgentleman in the service of the\n\tEmpress Queen, who calls himself the\n\tChevalier de Belle Fast, and wears\n\tthe red riband and star of the\n\tpope's order of the Spur.  He is\n\tmade for good society, polished,\n\tobliging, a libertine, without\n\tprejudices, fond of women, of good\n\tfood, of high play, prudent and\n\tdiscreet.\n\nThe Captain smiles at Roderick.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\tHe speaks Italian and French\n\tindifferently; but we have some\n\treason to fancy this Monsieur de\n\tBelle Fast is a native of your\n\tcountry of Ireland, and that he has\n\tcome here as a spy.\n\nThe Captain rises and begins to pace back and forth.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\tNaturally, your knowledge of English\n\tmakes you an ideal choice to go into\n\this service.  Of course, you will\n\tnot know a word of English; and if\n\tthe Chevalier asks as to the\n\tparticularity of your accent, say\n\tyou are Hungarian.  The servant who\n\tcame with him will be turned away\n\ttoday, and the person to whom he has\n\tapplied for a faithful fellow will\n\trecommend you.\n\nRoderick nods.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\tYou are a Hungarian; you served in\n\tthe army, and left on account of\n\tweakness in the loins.  He gambles a\n\tgreat deal, and wins.  Do you know\n\tthe cards well?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tOnly a very little, as soldiers do.\n\n\t\t\tCAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN\n\tI had thought you more expert.  You\n\tmust find out if the Chevalier\n\tcheats.  He sees the English and\n\tAustrian envoys continually, and the\n\tyoung men of either ministry sup\n\trepeatedly at his house.  Find out\n\twhat they talk of, for how much each\n\tplays, especially if any of them\n\tplay on parole.  If you are able to,\n\tread his private letters, though\n\tabout those which go to the post,\n\tyou need not trouble yourself -- we\n\tlook at them there.  But never see\n\thim write a note without finding out\n\tto whom it goes, and by what channel\n\tor messenger.  He sleeps with the\n\tkeys of his dispatch-box with a\n\tstring around his neck -- twenty\n\tfrederics, if you get an impression\n\tof the keys.\n\n\t\t\tMINISTER GALGENSTEIN\n\tDoes this assignment interest you?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tYes, Minister, I am interested in\n\tany work in which I can be of\n\tservice to Captain Galgenstein.\n\nThe Minister studies Roderick, coldly.\n\nEXT.  CHEVALIER DE BELLE FAST'S HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY\n\nRoderick, now dressed in civilian clothes, admires a\nbeautiful carriage, waiting at the door.  Then he enters.\n\nINT.

Here is my letter.\n\nRoderick bows, and hands him a letter from that gentleman,\nwith which the Captain had taken care to provide him.\n\nAs the Chevalier reads the letter, Roderick has the\nleisure to examine him.\n\nHe is a man of sixty years of age, dressed superbly,\nwearing rings, diamonds and laces.\n\nOne of his eyes is closed with a black patch, and he wears\na little white and red paint, and a pair of moustachios,\nwhich fall over his lip.\n\nThe Chevalier is seated at a table near the window to read\nthe letter.\n\n\t\t\tCHEVALIER\n\tYour name is Lazlo Zilagyi?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tYes, sir.\n\n\t\t\tCHEVALIER\n\tYou come highly recommended by Herr\n\tSeebach.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tHerr Seebach was a very kind\n\temployer.\n\n\t\t\tCHEVALIER\n\tFor whom else have you worked?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tNo one, sir.  Before that I served\n\tin the army but had to leave due to\n\tweakness of the loins.\n\n\t\t\tCHEVALIER\n\tWho else can give me information\n\tabout you?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tOnly the agency of servants.\n\nThe Chevalier puts the letter down, looks at Roderick for\na few seconds, and then smiles.\n\n\t\t\tCHEVALIER\n\tYou will do.  I will give you 30...\n\ta day.  I do not provide your\n\tclothing; you will sleep at home,\n\tand you will be at my orders every\n\tmorning at seven o'clock.\n\nHe notices Roderick begin to tremble and look peculiar.\n\n\t\t\tCHEVALIER\n\tIs there something wrong?\n\nHe goes up to Roderick.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tIt was very imprudent of me; but\n\twhen I saw the splendor of his\n\tappearance, the nobleness of his\n\tmanner, I felt it impossible to keep\n\tdisguise with him.  You, who have\n\tnever been out of your country know\n\tlittle what it is to hear a friendly\n\tvoice in captivity; and there's a\n\tmany a man that will understand the\n\tcause of the burst of feeling which\n\twas about to take place.\n\nThe Chevalier takes Roderick by the shoulder.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (as he speaks,\n\t\t    bursting into tears)\n\tSir, I have a confession to make.  I\n\tam an Irishman, and my name is\n\tRoderick James.  I was abducted into\n\tthe Prussian army two years ago, and\n\tnow I have been put into your\n\tservice by my Captain and his uncle,\n\tthe Minister of Police, to serve as\n\ta watch upon your actions, of which\n\tI am to give information to the same\n\tquarter.  For this odious service, I\n\thave been promised my discharge, and\n\ta hundred guineas.\n\nSobbing, Roderick falls into his arms.\n\n\t\t\tCHEVALIER\n\tThe rascals!  They think to catch\n\tme, do they?  Why, young man, my\n\tchief conspiracy is a faro-bank.\n\tBut the king is so jealous, that he\n\twill see a spy in every person who\n\tcomes to his miserable capital, in\n\tthe great sandy desert here.\n\nEXT.

BERLIN - LAKE WANNSEE - DAY\n\nRoderick and the Chevalier walking along the bank.\n\n\t\t\tCHEVALIER\n\tThe cards are now my only\n\tlivelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck,\n\tand then I lay out my money in these\n\ttrinkets you see.  It's property,\n\tlook you, and the only way I have\n\tfound of keeping a little about me.\n\tWhen the luck goes against me, why,\n\tmy dear, my diamonds go to the\n\tpawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do\n\tyou understand the cards?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI can play as soldiers do, but have\n\tno great skill.\n\n\t\t\tCHEVALIER\n\tWe will practice in the mornings, my\n\tboy, and I'll put you up to a thing\n\tor two worth knowing.\n\nINT.

GARDEN HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY\n\nRoderick, Minister Galgenstein, and Captain Galgenstein.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI carried my little reports to\n\tCaptain Galgenstein at the Garden\n\thouse outside the town where he gave\n\tme rendezvous.  These reports, of\n\tcourse, were arranged between me and\n\tthe Chevalier beforehand.  I was\n\tinstructed, and it is always the\n\tbest way, to tell as much truth as\n\tmy story would possible bear.\n\nDialogue comes up from under voice over.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tHe goes to church regularly -- he is\n\tvery religious, and after hearing\n\tmass comes home to breakfast.  Then\n\the takes an airing in his chariot\n\ttill dinner, which is served at\n\tnoon.  After dinner, he writes his\n\tletters, if he has any letters to\n\twrite; but he has very little to do\n\tin this way.  His letters are to the\n\tAustrian envoy, with whom he\n\tcorresponds, but who does not\n\tacknowledge him; and being written\n\tin English, or course, I look over\n\this shoulder.  He generally writes\n\tfor money.  He makes his party with\n\tCalsabigi, the lottery contractor,\n\tthe Russian attaches, two from the\n\tEnglish embassy, my lords Deuceace\n\tand Punter, who play a jeu d'enfer,\n\tand a few more.  He wins often, but\n\tnot always.  Lord Deuceace is a very\n\tfine player.  The Chevalier Elliott,\n\tthe English Minister, sometimes\n\tcomes, on which occasion the\n\tsecretaries do not play.\n\nINT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - NIGHT\n\nThe Chevalier is at play against several gentlemen,\nincluding the Prince of Turbingen, while Roderick signals\nthe cards.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tIt was agreed that I should keep my\n\tcharacter of valet, that in the\n\tpresence of strangers I should not\n\tknow a word of English, that I\n\tshould keep good lookout on the\n\ttrumps when I was serving the\n\tchampagne and punch about; and,\n\thaving a remarkably fine eyesight,\n\tand a great natural aptitude, I was\n\tspeedily able to give my dear\n\tbenefactor much assistance against\n\this opponents at the green table.\n\nSeveral cuts of playing and cheating to illustrate voice\nover.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tSimplicity was our secret.\n\tEverything successful is simple.\n\tIf, for instance, I wiped the dust\n\toff a chair with my napkin, it was\n\tto show that the enemy was strong in\n\tdiamonds; if I pushed it, he had an\n\tace, king; if I said, \"Punch or\n\twine, my lord?\" hearts was meant.\n\tIf \"Wine or punch?\" clubs.  If I\n\tblew my nose, it was to indicate\n\tthat there was another confederate\n\temployed by the adversary; and then,\n\tI warrant you, some pretty trials of\n\tskill would take place.  The Prince\n\tof Turbingen, although so young, had\n\ta very great skill and cleverness\n\twith the cards in every way; and it\n\twas only from hearing Ritter von\n\tBrandenburg, who came with him, yawn\n\tthree times when the Chevalier had\n\tthe ace of trumps, that I knew we\n\twere Greek to Greek, as it were.\n\nThe Prince loses a big hand, and, in a fury, throws down\nhis cards.  He stares at the table, then at the Chevalier.\n\n\t\t\tPRINCE\n\tChevalier, though I cannot say how,\n\tI believe you have cheated me.\n\n\t\t\tCHEVALIER\n\tI deny your Grace's accusations, and\n\tbeg you to say how you have been\n\tcheated?\n\n\t\t\tPRINCE\n\t\t   (glaring at Roderick)\n\tI don't know.\n\n\t\t\tCHEVALIER\n\tYour Grace owes me seventy thousand\n\tfrederics, which I have honorably\n\twon.\n\n\t\t\tPRINCE\n\tChevalier, if you will have your\n\tmoney now, you must fight for it.\n\tIf you will be patient, maybe I will\n\tpay you something another time.\n\n\t\t\tCHEVALIER\n\tYour Grace, if I am so tame as to\n\ttake this, then I must give up an\n\thonorable and lucrative occupation.\n\n\t\t\tPRINCE\n\tI have said all there is to be said.\n\tI am at your disposal for whatever\n\tpurposes you wish.

It seems that this\n\tcovering degrades him, or degrades\n\tme -- one of the other.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tBoth, my angel.

Now that I know it, I\n\twill no longer love her.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNT\n\tThen you yield to me.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tOn the instant.  Everyone must yield\n\tto such a nobleman as you.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNT\n\tVery well; but a man who yields\n\ttakes to his legs.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tThat is a trifle strong.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNT\n\tTake to your legs, low Irish dog.\n\nRoderick smiles at him.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tYour Excellency has wantonly\n\tinsulted me.

BILLIARD ROOM - NIGHT\n\nRoderick watches the Chevalier play with a Prussian\nofficer, Lieutenant Dascher.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tIt was my unrivaled skill with\n\tsword and pistol, and readiness to\n\tuse them, that maintained the\n\treputation of the firm.\n\nTowards the end of the game, Dascher, seeing that he is\nlosing, makes an unfair stroke, so obvious that the marker\ntells him so to his face.\n\nLieutenant Dascher, for whom the stroke wins the game,\ntakes the money which is in the stake bag, and puts it in\nhis pocket, paying no attention to the marker's\nadjurations, or to Roderick's.\n\nRoderick, who is without his sword, reaches for a billiard\ncue and swings it at Dascher's face.\n\nHe wards off the blow with his arm, drawing his sword and\nruns at Roderick, who is unarmed.\n\nThe marker, a sturdy young man, catches Dascher around the\nwaist and prevents murder.\n\n\t\t\tDASCHER\n\tI see that you are without your\n\tsword, but I believe you are a man\n\tof mettle.  Will you give me\n\tsatisfaction?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI shall be delighted; but you have\n\tlost and you must pay me the money\n\tbefore we meet, for, after all, you\n\tcannot pay me when you are dead.\n\n\t\t\tANOTHER OFFICER\n\tI will undertake to pay you the 20\n\tlouis, but only tomorrow morning at\n\tthe meeting.\n\nEXT.  FIELD - DAY\n\nOn the field, there are six people waiting with Dascher,\nand his seconds.  Dascher takes 20 louis from his pocket\nand hands them to Roderick, saying:\n\n\t\t\tDASCHER\n\tI may have been mistaken, but I mean\n\tto make you pay deadly for your\n\tbrutality.\n\nRoderick takes the money and puts it in his purse with the\nutmost calm, making no reply to the other's boasting.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (privately)\n\tIt is distasteful to kill a\n\tscoundrel -- that should be work for\n\ta hangman.\n\n\t\t\tCHEVALIER\n\tTo risk one's life against such\n\tpeople is an imposition.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (laughs)\n\tI risk nothing, for I am certain to\n\tkill him.\n\n\t\t\tCHEVALIER\n\tCertain?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tPerfectly certain, because I shall\n\tmake him tremble.\n\nHe takes his station between two trees, about four paces\napart, and draws a pair of dueling pistols.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tYou have only to pace yourself at\n\tten paces difference, and fire\n\tfirst.  The space between these two\n\ttrees is the place where I choose to\n\twalk back and forth.  You may walk\n\ttoo, if you wish, when it is my turn\n\tto fire.\n\nNo one could have explained his intentions more clearly or\nspoken more calmly.\n\n\t\t\tDASCHER\n\tBut we must decide who is to have\n\tthe first shot.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tThere is no need of that.  I never\n\tfire first; and, in any case, you\n\thave that right.\n\nDascher places himself at the specified distance.\n\nRoderick walks slowly back and forth between the two trees\nwithout looking at him.\n\nDascher takes aim and fires, missing.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (with the greatest\n\t\t    composure)\n\tYou missed me, sir.  I was sure you\n\twould.  Try again.\n\nThe others think he is mad, and had expected some kind of\ndiscussion between the parties, but not a bit of it.\n\nDascher takes careful aim and fires a second shot, again\nmissing Roderick.\n\nWithout a word, but in a firm and confident manner,\nRoderick fires his first shot into the air.\n\nDascher looks amazed.  Then, aiming at Dascher with his\nsecond pistol, he hits him in the center of the forehead\nand stretches him out dead on the ground.\n\nEXT.  ROAD - DAY\n\nRoderick and Chevalier traveling in their coach.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tThus is will be seen that our life,\n\tfor all its splendor was one of\n\textreme difficulty and danger,\n\trequiring high talents and courage\n\tfor success, and sudden and\n\tunexpected departures.\n\nThey meet a four-wheel carriage, drawn by two horses,\ncarrying a master and a servant.\n\nThe driver of the four-wheel carriage wants Roderick's\ndriver to make way for him.\n\nRoderick's driver protests that if he does, he will upset\nhis master in the ditch, but the other insists.\n\nRoderick addresses the master, a handsome young man, and\nasks him to order his driver to make way for him.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI am posting, monsieur, and\n\tfurthermore I am a foreigner.\n\n\t\t\tSTRANGER\n\tMonsieur, here in Saxony, the post\n\thas no special right, and if you are\n\ta foreigner, you must admit that you\n\thave no greater claim than mine,\n\tsince I am in my own country.\n\nAt that, Roderick gets out and holding his drawn-sword\ntells the stranger to get out, or to make way for him.\n\nThe stranger replies, with a smile, that he has no sword\nand that, in any case, he will not fight for such a silly\nreason.\n\nHe tells Roderick to get back in his chaise, and he makes\nway for him.\n\nINT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nRoderick and the Chevalier running a faro bank when an\nimportant lady suffers a huge loss.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tThe ladies were passionately fond of\n\tplay, and hence would often arise no\n\tsmall trouble to us; for the truth\n\tmost be told, that the ladies loved\n\tto play, but not to pay.  The point\n\tof honor is not understood by the\n\tcharming sex; and it was with the\n\tgreatest difficulty that we could\n\tkeep them from the table, could get\n\ttheir money if they lost or, if they\n\tpaid, prevent them from using the\n\tmost furious and extraordinary means\n\tof revenge.\n\nEXT.  ROAD - DAWN\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tOn this evening, the lady of high\n\trank, after I had won a considerable\n\tsum in diamonds and pearls from her,\n\tsent her lover with a band of cut-\n\tthroats to waylay me.\n\nRoderick and the Chevalier are sound asleep in their\ncarriage when they are awakened by a violent jolt, upon\nwhich the carriage overturns in the middle of the road.\n\nThe Chevalier is underneath, and screams from the pain in\nhis right arm, which he thinks is broken.\n\nTheir servant forces the door open to help them out,\ntelling them that the two postilions have fled.\n\nRoderick easily gets out of the carriage through the door,\nwhich is above him, but the Chevalier, unable to move\nbecause of his disabled arm, has to be pulled out.\n\nHis piercing shrieks make Roderick laugh, because of the\nstrange oaths with which he interlards his prayers.\n\nFrom the carriage, Roderick takes his dueling pistols,\nand sword.\n\nRoderick tells his servant to mount and to looking for\narmed peasants in the vicinity; money in hand, he leaves.\n\nThe Chevalier has lain down on the hard ground, groaning\nand in no condition to resist robbers.\n\nRoderick makes his own preparations to sell his fortune\nand his life at the highest price.\n\nHis carriage is close to the ditch, and he unhitches the\nhorses, tieing them to the wheels and the pole in a\ncircle, and stations himself behind them with weapons.\n\nIn this predicament, Roderick cannot help laughing at the\npoor Chevalier, who is writhing like a dying dolphin on a\nseashore, and uttering the most pitiful execrations, when\na mare, whose back was turned to him, take it into her\nempty head to empty her bladder on him.  There is nothing\nto be done; he has to put up with the whole stinking rain,\nand to forgive Roderick's laughter, which he has not the\nstrength to hold in.\n\nThe chill wind and the silence are suddenly broken by an\nattack, which is half-hearted and uncertain, by the lady's\nlover, and his hesitant band of six cut-throats.\n\nSome falter and run away as soon as Roderick fires his\npistol.\n\nThe leader and two heartier followers engage Roderick.\nDuring the fight, they mortally wound the helpless\nChevalier and two of them are killed.\n\nAfter they flee, Roderick kneels by the Chevalier, who\nutters some appropriate last words, then dies.\n\nHis servant finally arrives at full gallop, shouting at\nthe top of his voice, and followed by a band of peasants,\neach with his lantern, come to his rescue.  There are ten\nor twelve of them, all armed with muskets, and all ready\nto obey his orders.\n\nEXT.  SPA - HOTEL - DAY\n\nRoderick's carriage arrives.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAfter making suitable arrangements\n\tfor the Chevalier's burial, in\n\tproper accord with his church, I\n\ttraveled to Spa, which was now in\n\tseason, alone, to continue my\n\tprofession which formerly had the\n\tsupport of my friend and mentor.\n\nINT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nCrowds surround Roderick.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI was by this time one of the best-\n\tknown characters in Europe; and the\n\tfame of my exploits, my duels, my\n\tcourage at play, would bring crowds\n\tround me in any public society where\n\tI appeared.\n\nINT.  CASINO - NIGHT\n\nAttractive women alone, while men are at the gaming table.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tThe passion for play is stronger\n\tthan the passion for gallantry; the\n\tgamester at Spa has neither time to\n\tstop to consider the merits of a\n\twoman, nor the courage to make\n\tsacrifices for her.\n\nEXT.  GARDEN IN SPA - DAY\n\nThe Countess of Cosgrove walks beside her husband, Sir\nWilliam Cosgrove, who is in a wheelchair.  They are\naccompanied by their young son, Lord Brookside, and two\nservants.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tIn evoking the recollections of\n\tthese days, I have nothing but\n\tpleasure.  I would if I could say as\n\tmuch of a lady who will henceforth\n\tplay a considerable part in the\n\tdrama of my life -- I mean the\n\tCountess of Cosgrove, whose fatal\n\tacquaintance I made at Spa, very\n\tsoon after the tragic events which\n\tcaused me to quit Germany.\n\nCloser shot of the Countess.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tVictoria, Countess of Cosgrove.  A\n\tCountess and a Viscountess in her\n\town right.\n\nCloser shot of Sir William Cosgrove.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tShe was the wife of her cousin, the\n\tRight Honorable Sir William Reginald\n\tCosgrove, Knight of the Bath, and\n\tMinister to George II and George III\n\tof several of the smaller courts of\n\tEurope.\n\nCloser shot of young Lord Brookside, walking behind them\nin the care of his governor.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tShe was the mother to Viscount\n\tBrookside -- a melancholy, deserted,\n\tlittle boy, about whom his father\n\twas more than indifferent, and whom\n\this mother never saw.\n\nINT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nShots of Sir William Cosgrove being wheeled in, and at\nplay with Roderick, and some other gentlemen.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI made Sir William Cosgrove's\n\tacquaintance as usual at the play-\n\ttable.  One could not but admire the\n\tspirit and gallantry with which he\n\tpursued his favorite pastime; for,\n\tthough worn out with gout and a\n\tmyriad of diseases, a cripple\n\twheeled about in a chair, and\n\tsuffering pangs of agony, yet you\n\twould see him every morning, and\n\tevery evening at his post behind the\n\tdelightful green cloth.\n\n\t\t\tSIR WILLIAM\n\tHang it, Mr. Roderick James, you\n\thave no more manners than a barber,\n\tand I think my black footman has\n\tbeen better educated than you; but\n\tyou are a young fellow of\n\toriginality and pluck, and I like\n\tyou, sir.  because you seem\n\tdetermined to go to the devil by a\n\tway of your own.\n\nLaughter at the table.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI am obliged to observe, Sir William\n\tCosgrove, that since you are bound\n\tfor the next world much sooner than\n\tI am, I will depend on you to get\n\tcomfortable quarters arranged for\n\tme.\n\nLaughter.\n\n\t\t\tSIR WILLIAM\n\tIndeed, you are right, sir.  Look at\n\tme.  Marriage has added forty years\n\tto my life.  I am dying, a worn-out\n\tcripple, at the age of fifty.  When\n\tI took off Lady Cosgrove, there was\n\tno man of my years who looked so\n\tyoung as myself.  Fool that I was!\n\tI had enough with my pensions,\n\tperfect freedom, the best society in\n\tEurope -- and I gave up all these,\n\tand married and was miserable.  Take\n\ta warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and\n\tstick to the trumps.  Do anything,\n\tbut marry.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tWould you have me spend my life all\n\talone?\n\n\t\t\tSIR WILLIAM\n\tIn truth, sir, yes, but, if you must\n\tmarry, then marry a virtuous drudge.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (laughing)\n\tThe milkmaid's daughter?\n\n\t\t\tSIR WILLIAM\n\tWell, why not a milkmaid's daughter?\n\tNo man of sense need restrict\n\thimself or deny himself a single\n\tamusement for his wife's sake; on\n\tthe contrary, if he selects the\n\tanimal properly, he will choose such\n\ta one as shall be no bar to his\n\tpleasure, but a comfort in his hours\n\tof annoyance.  For instance, I have\n\tgot the gout; who tends me?  A hired\n\tvalet who robs me whenever he has\n\tthe power.  My wife never comes near\n\tme.  What friend have I?  None in\n\tthe wide world.  Men of the world,\n\tas you and I are, don't make\n\tfriends, and we are fools for our\n\tpains.\n\nPolite laughter at the table.\n\n\t\t\tSIR WILLIAM\n\tMy lady is a weak woman, but she is\n\tmy mistress.  She is a fool, but she\n\thas got the better of one of the\n\tbest heads in Christendom.  She is\n\tenormously rich, but somehow I have\n\tnever been so poor, as since I\n\tmarried her.  I thought to better\n\tmyself, and she has made me\n\tmiserable and killed me, and she\n\twill do as much for my successor\n\twhen I'm gone.\n\nThere is a reflective silence at the table.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tHas her ladyship a very large\n\tincome?\n\nThis question causes Sir William to burst out into a\nyelling laugh, joined by the rest of the table, and makes\nRoderick blush not a little at his gaucherie.\n\nEXT.  ORNAMENTAL GARDEN - SPA - NIGHT\n\nA beautiful scene, lit by the flambeaux, held by a dozen\nfootmen.  A small orchestra, playing in a Temple of Love,\nsome dancers, people gambling and lounging along a line of\ntrees.\n\nRoderick approaches the Countess.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tDespite my friend's strong warning.\n\tI resolves to become acquainted with\n\this lady.  Sir William Cosgrove was\n\tdying.  His widow would be a rich\n\tprize.  Why should I not win her,\n\tand, with her, the means of making\n\tin the world that figure which my\n\tgenius and inclination desired?\n\tWhen I determine, I look upon the\n\tthing as done.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tCharming lady, tell me the truth and\n\tearn my gratitude.  Have you a\n\tlover?\n\nThe countess laughs.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tNo.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tHave you had one?\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tNever.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tBut, for a time... a passing fancy?\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tNot even that.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tHow can I believe that there is not\n\ta man who has inspired desires in\n\tyou?\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tNot one.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tHave you not a man whom you value?\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tThat man has, perhaps, not yet been\n\tborn.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tWhat!  You have not met a man worthy\n\tof your attention?\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tMany worthy of attention; but\n\tvaluing is something more.  I could\n\tvalue only someone whom I loved.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tThen you have never loved?  Your\n\theart is empty.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tYour word \"empty\" makes me laugh.\n\tIs it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If\n\tit is fortunate, I congratulate\n\tmyself.  If it is unfortunate, I do\n\tnot care, for I am not aware of it.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tIt is nonetheless a misfortune, and\n\tyou will know it when you love.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tBut if, when I love, I am unhappy, I\n\twill know that my empty heart was my\n\tgood fortune.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tThat is true, but it seems to me\n\timpossible that you should be\n\tunhappy in love.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tIt is only too possible.  Love\n\trequires a mutual harmony which is\n\tdifficult, and it is even more\n\tdifficult to make it last.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI agree; but God put us on earth to\n\ttake that risk.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tA man may need to do that, and find\n\tit amusing; but a girl is bound by\n\tother laws.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI believe you, and I see I must\n\thasten to leave, for otherwise I\n\tshall become the unhappiest of men.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tHow so?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tBy loving you, with no hope of\n\tpossessing you.\n\nShe laughs.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tYou want my heart?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tIt is my only object.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tTo make me wretched in two weeks.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tTo love you until death.  To\n\tsubscribe to all your commands.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tThe amusing thing is that you\n\tdeceive me without knowing, if it is\n\ttrue that you love me.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tDeceiving someone without knowing it\n\tis something new for me.  If I do\n\tnot know it, I am innocent.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tBut you deceive me nonetheless if I\n\tbelieve you, for it will not be in\n\tyour power to love me when you love\n\tme no longer.\n\nRoderick laughs and kisses her.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tBe so good as to tell me with whom\n\tyou think you are?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tWith a woman who is completely\n\tcharming, be she a princess or a\n\twoman of the lowest condition, and\n\twho, regardless of her rank, will\n\tshow me some kindness, tonight.\n\nShe laughs.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tAnd if she does not choose to show\n\tyou some kindness?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tThen I will respectfully take leave\n\tof her.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tYou will do as you please.  It seems\n\tto me that such a matter can hardly\n\tbe discussed until after people know\n\teach other.  Do you not agree?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tYes -- but I am afraid of being\n\tdeceived.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tPoor man.  And, for that reason, you\n\twant to begin where people end?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI ask only a payment on account\n\ttoday -- after that, you will find\n\tme undemanding, obedient and\n\tdiscreet.\n\nShe laughs.

He stops.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tWill we always leave it at this?\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tAlways, my dear one, never any\n\tfurther.  Love is a child to be\n\tpacified with trifles.  A full diet\n\tcan only kill it.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI know better than you do.  Love\n\twants a more substantial fare, and\n\tif it is stubbornly withheld, it\n\twithers away.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tOur abstinence makes our love\n\timmortal.  If I loved you a quarter\n\tof an hour ago, now I should love\n\tyou even more.  But I should love\n\tyou less if you exhausted my joy by\n\tsatisfying all my desires.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tLet us give each other complete\n\thappiness, and let us be sure that\n\tas many times as we satisfy our\n\tdesires, they will each time be born\n\tanew.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tMy husband has convinced me of the\n\tcontrary.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tSir William Cosgrove is a man who is\n\tdying, and yet I envy him more than\n\tany man in Christendom.  He enjoys a\n\tprivilege of which I am deprived.\n\tHe may take you in his arms whenever\n\the pleases, and no veil keeps his\n\tsenses, his eyes, his soul from\n\tenjoying your beauty.\n\nShe silences him with her fingertips.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tShall I tell you something -- I\n\tbelieved what was called love came\n\tafter the union -- and I was\n\tsurprised when my husband, making me\n\ta woman, made me know it only by\n\tpain, unaccompanied by any pleasure.\n\tI saw that my imaginings had stood\n\tme in better stead.  And so we\n\tbecame only friends, seldom sleeping\n\ttogether and arousing no curiosity\n\tin each other, yet on good terms for\n\ta while, as whenever he wanted me, I\n\twas at his service, but since the\n\toffering was not seasoned with love,\n\the found it tasteless, and seldom\n\tdemanded it.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tO, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg\n\tyou.  Stop believing in your\n\texperience.  You have never known\n\tlove.  My very soul is leaving me!\n\tCatch it on your lips, and give me\n\tyours!\n\nThey kiss ardently.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tTo make a long story short, her\n\tladyship and I were in love six\n\thours after we met; and after I once\n\tgot into her ladyship's good graces,\n\tI found innumerable occasions to\n\timprove my intimacy, and was\n\tscarcely ever out of her company.\n\nEXT.

He was\n\tcontinually tinkered up by doctors,\n\tand, what with my usual luck, he\n\tmight be restored to health and live\n\tI don't know how many years.  If\n\tCosgrove would not die, where was\n\tthe use of my pursing his lady?  But\n\tmy fears were to prove groundless,\n\tfor on that very night, patient\n\tnature would claim her account.\n\n\t\t\tSIR WILLIAM\n\tGood evening, Mr. James, have you\n\tdone with my lady?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI beg your pardon?\n\n\t\t\tSIR WILLIAM\n\tCome, come, sir.  I am a man who\n\twould rather be known as a cuckold\n\tthan a fool.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI think, Sir William Cosgrove, you\n\thave had too much drink.  Your\n\tchaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me\n\tinto the company of your lady to\n\tadvise me on a religious matter, of\n\twhich she is a considerable expert.\n\nSir William Cosgrove greets this line with a yell of\nlaughter.  His laugh is not jovial or agreeable, but\nrather painful and sardonic, and ends in a violent fit of\ncoughing.\n\n\t\t\tSIR WILLIAM\n\tGentlemen, see this amiable youth!\n\tHe has been troubled by religious\n\tscruples, and has flown for refuge\n\tto my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has\n\tasked for advise from my wife, Lady\n\tCosgrove, and between them both,\n\tthey are confirming my ingenious\n\tyoung friend in his faith.  Did you\n\tever hear of such doctors and such a\n\tdisciple?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tFaith, sir, if I want to learn good\n\tprinciples, it's surely better I\n\tshould apply for them to your lady,\n\tand your chaplin than to you?\n\n\t\t\tSIR WILLIAM\n\t\t   (laughing, but pretty\n\t\t    red)\n\tHe wants to step into my shoes!  He\n\twants to step into my shoes!\n\nRoderick stares at him coldly.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tWell, if my intentions are what you\n\tthink they are -- if I do wish to\n\tstep into your shoes, what then?  I\n\thave no other intentions than you\n\thad yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's\n\twealth may be great, but am I not of\n\ta generous nature enough to use it\n\tworthily?  Her rank is lofty, but\n\tnot so lofty as my ambition.  I will\n\tbe sworn to muster just as much\n\tregard for my Lady Cosgrove as you\n\tever showed her; and if I win her,\n\tand wear her when you are dead and\n\tgone, corbleu, knight, do you think\n\tthat it will be the fear of your\n\tghost will deter me?\n\n\t\t\tSIR WILLIAM\n\tIs it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for\n\tme, as I am drawing near the goal,\n\tto find my home such a happy one; my\n\twife so fond of me, that she is even\n\tnow thinking of appointing a\n\tsuccessor?  Isn't it a comfort to\n\tsee her; like a prudent housewife,\n\tgetting everything ready for her\n\thusband's departure?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI hope that you are not thinking of\n\tleaving us soon, knight?\n\n\t\t\tSIR WILLIAM\n\tNot so soon, my dear, as you may\n\tfancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have\n\tbeen given over many times these\n\tfour years, and there was always a\n\tcandidate or two waiting to apply\n\tfor the situation.  Who knows how\n\tlong I may keep you waiting.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tSir, let those laugh that win.\n\n\t\t\tSIR WILLIAM\n\tI am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm\n\tgrieved to keep you or any gentleman\n\twaiting.  Had you not better to\n\tarrange with my doctor or get the\n\tcook to flavor my omelette with\n\tarsenic?

I\n\tdid not escape the common lot.  In\n\tour journey westwards, my Lady\n\tCosgrove chose to quarrel with me\n\tbecause I had pulled out a pipe of\n\ttobacco.  Lady Cosgrove was a\n\thaughty woman, and I hate pride, and\n\tI promise you that, in this instant,\n\tI overcame this vice in her.\n\nRoderick blows smoke into the Countess' face.

Indeed, I am one of\n\tthose born clever enough at gaining\n\ta fortune, but incapable of keeping\n\tone; for the qualities and energy,\n\twhich lead a man to accept the\n\tfirst, are often the very causes of\n\this ruin in the latter case; indeed,\n\tI know of no other reason for the\n\tmisfortunes which finally befell me.\n\nINT.

My company\n\tfrom this, of course, fancied I was\n\ta tyrant over her; whereas, I was\n\tonly a severe and careful guardian\n\tof a silly, bad-tempered and weak-\n\tminded lady.\n\nEXT.

And, I must\n\tconfess, it was with very little\n\tattention on my part that I could\n\tbring her into good humor, and, up\n\tto the very last day of our being\n\ttogether, would be reconciled to me,\n\tand fondle me, if I addressed her a\n\tsingle kind word.  Such is female\n\tinconsistency.\n\nINT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY\n\nRoderick and the Countess fighting about her refusal to\nsign some papers.  Live dialogue under voice over.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tShe was luckily very fond of her\n\tyoungest son, and through him I had\n\ta wholesome and effectual hold on\n\ther; for if in any of her tantrums\n\tor fits of haughtiness, she\n\tpretended to have the upper-hand, to\n\tassert her authority against mine,\n\tto refuse to sign such papers as I\n\tmight think necessary for the\n\tdistribution of our large and\n\tcomplicated property.\n\nRoderick picks up baby Patrick.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI would have Master Patrick carried\n\toff to Chiswick for a couple of\n\tdays; and I warrant me his lady-\n\tmother could hold out no longer and\n\twould agree to anything I proposed.\n\nThe Countess rushes to the window to see the child being\nput into a carriage.\n\nINT.

COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY\n\nThe Countess discovers Roderick making love to the child's\nnurse.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tDo what one would to please her, my\n\tlady would never be happy or in good\n\thumor.  And soon she added a mean,\n\tdetestable jealousy to all her other\n\tfaults, and would weep and wring her\n\thands, and threaten to commit\n\tsuicide, and I know not what.\n\nShe screams and shouts something about suicide.\n\nHer son, Brookside, comes running in and consoles her.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tHer death would have been no comfort\n\tto me, as I leave any person of\n\tcommon prudence to imagine; for that\n\tscoundrel of a young Brookside who\n\twas about to become my greatest\n\tplague and annoyance, would have\n\tinherited every penny of the\n\tproperty.\n\nINT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY\n\nRoderick, bored and distracted, sits before a stack of\nbills and papers, with his accountant.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tHumble people envy us great men, and\n\tfancy that our lives are all\n\tpleasure.  But the troubles of\n\tpoverty, the rascality of agents,\n\tthe quibbles of lawyers are endless.\n\tMy life at this period seemed to\n\tconsist of nothing but drafts of\n\tletters and money-brokers relative\n\tto the raising of money, and the\n\tinsuring of Lady Cosgrove's life,\n\tand innumerable correspondence with\n\tupholsterers, decorators, cooks,\n\thorsekeepers, bailiffs, and\n\tstewards.\n\nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDENS - DAY\n\nVarious cuts.\n\nBirthday fete for Patrick who is now five years old.\n\nGaily colored tents, ponies, a puppet show, expensive\npresents.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tMy own dear boy, Patrick, was now\n\tfive years old, and was the most\n\tpolite and engaging child ever seen;\n\tit was a pleasure to treat him with\n\tkindness and distinction; the little\n\tfellow was the pink of fashion,\n\tbeauty, and good breeding.  In fact,\n\the could not have been otherwise,\n\twith the care both his parents\n\tbestowed upon him, and the\n\tattentions which were lavished upon\n\thim in every way.\n\nBrookside and Roderick.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tWhereas, young Brookside had grown\n\tto be a very nasty and disrespectful\n\tfellow indeed.  In my company, he\n\tpreserved the most rigid silence,\n\tand a haughty, scornful demeanor,\n\twhich was so much the more\n\tdisagreeable because there was\n\tnothing in his behavior I could\n\tactually take hold of to find fault\n\twith, although his whole conduct was\n\tinsolent and supercilious to the\n\thighest degree.\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - LIBRARY - DAY\n\nBrookside sitting alone reading a book.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tIn addition to this, the lad was\n\tfond of spending the chief part of\n\this time occupied with the musty old\n\tbooks, which he took out of the\n\tlibrary, and which I hate to see a\n\tyoung man of spirit pouring over.\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY\n\nBrookside and the Countess.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tThe insubordination of that boy was\n\tdreadful.  He used to quote passages\n\tof \"Hamlet\" to his mother, which\n\tmade her very angry.\n\nBrookside quoting \"Hamlet.\"\n\nThe Countess begins to cry and leaves the room.\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY\n\nRoderick caning young Brookside.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAs it is best to nip vice in the\n\tbud, and for a master of a family to\n\texercise his authority in such a\n\tmanner as that there may be no\n\tquestion about it, I took every\n\topportunity of coming to close\n\tquarters with Master Brookside.\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nMany guests around the table.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tHe always chose the days when\n\tcompany, or the clergy, or gentry of\n\tthe neighborhood were present, to\n\tmake violent, sarcastic, and\n\tinsolent speeches.\n\nBrookside begins to fondle and caress Patrick.\n\n\t\t\tBROOKSIDE\n\tDear child, what a pity it is I am\n\tnot dead for your sake!  The\n\tCosgroves would then have a worthy\n\trepresentative, and enjoy all the\n\tbenefits of the illustrious blood of\n\tthe James' of Duganstown, would they\n\tnot, Mr. James Cosgrove?\n\nINT.

PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nRoderick and his mother talk in whispers near the bed of\nthe sleeping Patrick.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER\n\tAh, Roderick, it's a blessing to see\n\tthat my darling boy has attained a\n\tposition I always knew was his due,\n\tand for which I pinched myself to\n\teducate him.  Little Patrick is a\n\tdarling boy, and you live in great\n\tsplendor, but how long will it last?\n\tYour lady-wife knows she has a\n\ttreasure she couldn't have had, had\n\tshe taken a duke to marry her, but\n\tif, one day, she should tire of my\n\twild Roderick and his old-fashioned\n\tIrish ways, or if she should die,\n\twhat future would there be for my\n\tson and grandson?\n\nINT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT\n\nRoderick and his mother.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER\n\tYou have not a penny of your own,\n\tand cannot transact any business\n\twithout the Countess' signature.\n\tUpon her death, the entire estate\n\twould go to young Brookside, who\n\tbears you little affection.  You\n\tcould be penniless tomorrow, and\n\tdarling Patrick at the mercy of his\n\tstepbrother.\n\nINT.  MOTHER'S ROOM - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT\n\nRoderick and his mother.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER\n\tI shall tell you a secret -- I shall\n\tnot rest until I see you Earl of\n\tDuganstown, and my grandson, a Lord\n\tViscount.\n\nShe smooths down Roderick's hair.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER\n\tThis head would become a coronet.\n\nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY\n\nRoderick and Mother slowly walking and talking.  Young\nPatrick, ahead of them sitting in a small cart, pulled by\na lamb.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER\n\tThese things entail considerable\n\texpense, and you will need your\n\tlady's blessing, but the young boy\n\tforms the great bond of union\n\tbetween you and her ladyship, and\n\tthere is no plan of ambition you\n\tcould propose in which she would not\n\tjoin for the poor lad's benefit, and\n\tno expense she will not eagerly\n\tincur, if it might be any means be\n\tshown to tend to his advancement.\n\tYou have important friends, and they\n\tcan tell you how these things are\n\tdone.\n\nINT.  LONDON GAMING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nStanding away from the play tables, Roderick chats with\nLord West, a fat giant of a man.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAnd, to be sure, I did know someone\n\twho knew precisely how these things\n\twere done, and this was the\n\tdistinguished solicitor and former\n\tGovernment Minister, Lord West,\n\twhose acquaintance I made, as I had\n\tso many others, at the gaming table.\n\n\t\t\tLORD WEST\n\tDo you happen to know Gustavus\n\tAdolphus, the thirteenth Earl of\n\tCrabs?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tBy name only.\n\n\t\t\tLORD WEST\n\tWell, sir, this nobleman is one of\n\tthe gentlemen of His Majesty's\n\tcloset, and one with whom our\n\trevered monarch is on terms of\n\tconsiderable intimacy.  I should say\n\tyou would be wise to fix upon this\n\tnobleman your chief reliance for the\n\tadvancement of your claim to the\n\tViscounty which you propose to get.\n\nINT.  LONDON CLUB - DAY\n\nRoderick having lunch with Lord West and the Earl of\nCrabs.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAnd for a five-hundred guinea fee,\n\tpaid to his City law-firm, Lord West\n\tkindly arranged a meeting with that\n\told scamp and swindler, Gustavus\n\tAdolphus, the thirteenth Earl of\n\tCrabs.\n\n\t\t\tEARL OF CRABS\n\tMr. Cosgrove, when I take up a\n\tperson, he or she is safe.  There is\n\tno question about them any more.  My\n\tfriends are the best people.  I\n\tdon't mean the most virtuous, or,\n\tindeed, the least virtuous, or the\n\tcleverest, or the stupidest, or the\n\trichest, or the best born, but the\n\t\"best\" -- in a word, people about\n\twhom there is no question.  I cannot\n\tpromise you how long it will take.\n\tYou can appreciate it is not an easy\n\tmatter.  But any gentlemen with an\n\testate, and ten-thousand a-year\n\tshould have a peerage.\n\nINT.  DRAWING ROOM - EARL OF CRABS - DAY\n\nRoderick being introduced to three noblemen, including the\nDuke of Rutland.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tThe striving after this peerage, I\n\tconsider to have been one of the\n\tmost unlucky dealings at this\n\tperiod.  I made unheard of\n\tsacrifices to bring it about.  I can\n\ttell you bribes were administered,\n\tand in high places too -- so near\n\tthe royal person of His Majesty that\n\tyou would be astonished were I to\n\tmention what great personages\n\tcondescended to receive our loans.\n\nINT.  DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nRoderick gives a beautiful diamond to a fat princess on\nher birthday.

FIELD - DAY\n\nReviewing the company of troops.\n\nRoderick, the Earl of Crabs, the Countess, Patrick and\nBrookside, several princes and noblemen and the Duke of\nRutland.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tOne of the main causes of expense\n\twhich this ambition of mine entailed\n\tupon me was the fitting out and\n\tarming of a company of infantry from\n\tthe Hackton estates, which I offered\n\tto my gracious sovereign for the\n\tcampaign against the American\n\trebels.  These troops, superbly\n\tequipped and clothed, were embarked\n\tat Portsmouth in the year 1778.\n\nINT.  ST.

Present also is the Duke of Rutland.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAnd the patriotism of the gentlemen\n\twho raised them was so acceptable at\n\tcourt that, on being presented by my\n\tLord Crabs, His Majesty condescended\n\tto notice me particularly and said:\n\n\t\t\tGEORGE III\n\tThat's right, Mr. Cosgrove, raise\n\tanother company, and go with them,\n\ttoo!\n\nINT.  COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tCrabs was really one of the most\n\tentertaining fellows in the world,\n\tand I took a sincere pleasure in his\n\tcompany, besides the interest and\n\tdesire I had in cultivating the\n\tsociety of the most important\n\tpersonages of the realm.\n\nRoderick clumsily tries to engage in conversation with the\nfamed Dr. Johnson, on the subject of a book or play, of\nthe day, and is rebuffed for his trouble.\n\n\t\t\tJOHNSON\n\tIf I were you, Mr. Cosgrove, I\n\tshould mind my horses and tailors\n\tand not trouble myself about\n\tletters.\n\nLaughter, Roderick bristles.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tDr. Johnson, I think you misbehave\n\tmost grossly, treating my opinions\n\twith no more respect than those of a\n\tschoolboy.  You fancy, sir, you know\n\ta great deal more than me, because\n\tyou quote your \"Aristotle\" and\n\t\"Plato,\" but can you tell me which\n\thorse will win at Epsom Downs next\n\tweek?  Can you shoot the ace of\n\tspades ten times without missing?\n\tIf so, talk about Aristotle and\n\tPlato with me.\n\n\t\t\tBOSWELL\n\t\t   (roars)\n\tDo you know who you're speaking to?!\n\n\t\t\tJOHNSON\n\tHold your tongue, Mr. Boswell, I had\n\tno right to brag of my Greek,\n\tgentlemen, and he has answered me\n\tvery well.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (pleased)\n\tDo you know ever a rhyme for\n\tAristotle?\n\n\t\t\tGOLDSMITH\n\t\t   (laughing)\n\tPort, if you please.\n\n\t\t\tJOHNSON\n\tWaiter, bring on of Captain James'\n\trhymes for Aristotle.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAnd we had six rhymes for Aristotle\n\tbefore we left the coffee house that\n\tevening.\n\nINT.

CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY\n\nRoderick is seated at a large table, stacked high with\nbills and letters; his accountant is seated next to him,\naided by a bookkeeper.  Roderick looks at each bill and\nhis accountant explains the charge.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tThe life I was leading was that of a\n\thappy man, but I was not happy.\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - LONG GALLERY - DAY\n\nRoderick, walking with big strides, leads Brookside by his\near.  Little Patrick runs alongside, pleading for his\nbrother.\n\n\t\t\tPATRICK\n\tPapa, please don't flog Brookside\n\ttoday.  It wasn't his fault --\n\treally is wasn't.\n\nRoderick ignores him.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tBy now, young Brookside was of so\n\twild, savage, and insubordinate a\n\tnature that I never had the least\n\tregard for him.  As he grew up to be\n\ta man, his hatred for me assumed an\n\tintensity quite wicked to think of\n\tand which, I promise you, I returned\n\twith interest.\n\nHe drags Brookside into his study, slamming the door\nbehind him.\n\nINT.  LIBRARY - DAY\n\nRoderick alone.  Brookside enters with a pistol.\n\n\t\t\tBROOKSIDE\n\t\t   (grinding his teeth)\n\tLook you now, Mister Roderick James,\n\tfrom this moment on, I will submit\n\tto no further chastisement from you!\n\tDo you understand that?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tGive me that pistol.\n\n\t\t\tBROOKSIDE\n\tTake heed, Mister James.  I will\n\tshoot you if you lay hands on me\n\tnow, or ever again.  Is that\n\tentirely clear to you, sir?\n\nRoderick stares hard at him, then he laughs and sits down.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI decided, at once, to give up that\n\tnecessary part of his education.\n\tIn truth, he then became the most\n\tviolent, daring, disobedient,\n\tscapegrace, that ever caused an\n\taffectionate parent pain; he was\n\tcertainly the most incorrigible.\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - BROOKSIDE'S ROOM - DAY\n\nBrookside smashing a chair over the head of his governor,\nReverend Hunt.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tTwice or thrice, Reverend Hunt\n\tattempted to punish my Lord\n\tBrookside; but I promise you the\n\trogue was too strong for him, and\n\tleveled the Oxford man to the\n\tground with a chair, greatly to the\n\tdelight of little Patrick, who cried\n\tout:  \"Bravo, Brooksy!  Thump him,\n\tthump him!\"\n\nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY\n\nBrookside and Patrick.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tWith the child, Brookside was,\n\tstrange to say, pretty tractable.\n\tHe took a liking to the little\n\tfellow -- I like him the more, he\n\tsaid, because he was \"half a\n\tCosgrove.\"\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - BALLROOM - NIGHT\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAnother day, it was Patrick's\n\tbirthday, we were giving a grand\n\tball and gala at Hackton, and it was\n\ttime for my Patrick to make his\n\tappearance among us.\n\nThere is a great crowding and tittering as the child comes\nin, led by his half-brother, who walks into the dancing-\nroom in his stockinged feet, leading little Patrick by the\nhand, paddling about in the great shoes of the older.\n\n\t\t\tBROOKSIDE\n\t\t   (very loudly)\n\tDon't you think he fits my shoes\n\tvery well, Sir Richard Wargrave?\n\nUpon which, the company begins to look at each other and\nto titter, and his mother comes up to Lord Brookside with\ngreat dignity, seizes the child to her breast, and says:\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tFrom the manner in which I love this\n\tchild, my lord, you ought to know\n\thow I would have loved his elder\n\tbrother, had he proved worthy of any\n\tmother's affection.\n\nBrookside is stunned by his mother's words.\n\n\t\t\tBROOKSIDE\n\tMadam, I have borne as long as\n\tmortal could endure the ill-\n\ttreatment of the insolent Irish\n\tupstart, whom you have taken into\n\tyour bed.  It is not only the\n\tlowness of his birth, and the\n\tgeneral brutality of his manners\n\twhich disgusts me, but the shameful\n\tnature of his conduct towards your\n\tladyship, his brutal and\n\tungentlemanlike behavior, his open\n\tinfidelity, his habits of\n\textravagance, intoxication, his\n\tshameless robberies and swindling of\n\tmy property and yours.  It is these\n\tinsults to you which shock and annoy\n\tme more than the ruffian's infamous\n\tconduct to myself.  I would have\n\tstood by your ladyship, as I\n\tpromised, but you seem to have taken\n\tlatterly your husband's part; and,\n\tas I cannot personally chastise this\n\tlow-bred ruffian, who, to our shame\n\tbe it spoken, is the husband of my\n\tmother, and as I cannot bear to\n\twitness his treatment of you, and\n\tloathe his horrible society as if it\n\twere the plague, I am determined to\n\tquit my native country, at least\n\tduring his detested life, or during\n\tmy own.\n\nBursting into tears, Lady Cosgrove leaves the room.\nRoderick loses control, and rushes at Brookside, knocking\ndown Lords, Dukes and Generals, left and right, who try to\ninterfere.\n\nThe company is scandalizes by the entire incident.\n\nINT.  LONDON CLUB - NIGHT\n\nAction as per voice over.  Roderick is shunned.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tIf I had murdered my lord, I could\n\tscarcely have been received with\n\tmore shameful obloquy and slander\n\tthan now followed me in town and\n\tcountry.  My friends fell away from\n\tme, and a legend arose of my cruelty\n\tto my stepson.\n\nINT.  ST. JAMES - DAY\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tMy reception at court was scarcely\n\tmore cordial.  On paying my respects\n\tto my sovereign at St. James, His\n\tMajesty pointedly asked me when I\n\thad news of Lord Brookside.  On\n\twhich I replied, with no ordinary\n\tpresence of mind:\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tSire, my Lord Brookside has set sail\n\tto fight the rebels against Your\n\tMajesty's crown in America.  Does\n\tYour Majesty desire that I should\n\tsend another company to aid him?\n\nThe King stares at Roderick, turns on his heel and quickly\nleaves the presence-chamber.\n\nRoderick is approached by the Duke of Rutland, who takes\nhim aside into an alcove.\n\n\t\t\tDUKE OF RUTLAND\n\t\t   (speaking very\n\t\t    quietly)\n\tLet me tell you, sir, that your\n\tconduct has been very odiously\n\trepresented to the King, and has\n\tformed the subject of royal comment.\n\tThe King has said, influenced by\n\tthese representations, that you are\n\tthe most disreputable man in the\n\tthree kingdoms, and a dishonor to\n\tyour name and country.\n\nRoderick begins to sputter.\n\n\t\t\tDUKE OF RUTLAND\n\tHear me out, please.  It has been\n\tintimated to His Majesty that you\n\thad raised the American Company for\n\tthe sole purpose of getting the\n\tyoung Viscount to command it, and so\n\tget rid of him.  And, further, that\n\tyou had paid the very man in the\n\tcompany, who was ordered to dispatch\n\thim in the first general action.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tThus it is that my loyalty is\n\trewarded, and my sacrifices in favor\n\tof my country viewed!\n\n\t\t\tDUKE OF RUTLAND\n\tAs for your ambitious hopes\n\tregarding the Irish peerages, His\n\tMajesty has also let it be known\n\tthat you have been led astray by\n\tthat Lord Crabs, who likes to take\n\tmoney, but who has no more influence\n\tto get a coronet than to procure a\n\tPope's tiara.  And, if you have it\n\tin mind to call upon Lord Crabs, you\n\twill be disappointed.  He left for\n\tthe continent on Tuesday, and may be\n\taway for several months.\n\nINT.  LORD WEST'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nRoderick and Lord West.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI insist upon being allowed to\n\tappear before His Majesty and clear\n\tmyself of the imputations against\n\tme, to point out my services to the\n\tgovernment, and to ask when the\n\treward, that had been promised me,\n\tthe title held by my ancestors, is\n\tagain to be revived in my person.\n\nThere is a sleepy coolness in the fat Lord West.  He hears\nRoderick with half-shut eyes.  When he finishes his\nviolent speech, which he has made striding about the room,\nLord West opens one eye, smiles, and says:   \n\n\t\t\tLORD WEST\n\t\t   (gently)\n\tHave you done, Mr. Cosgrove?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tYes!\n\n\t\t\tLORD WEST\n\tWell, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you\n\tpoint by point.  The King is\n\texceedingly averse to make peers, as\n\tyou know.  Your claim, as you call\n\tthem, have been laid before him, and\n\tHis Majesty's gracious reply was,\n\tthat you were the most impudent man\n\tin his dominions, and merited a\n\thalter, rather than a coronet.  As\n\tfor withdrawing your support from\n\tus, you are perfectly welcome to\n\tcarry yourself whithersoever you\n\tplease.  And, now, as I have a great\n\tdeal of occupation, perhaps you will\n\tdo me the favor to retire, or tell\n\tme if there is anything else in the\n\tworld in which I can oblige you.\n\nSo saying, Lord West raises his hand lazily to the bell,\nand bows Roderick out.\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY\n\nRoderick and his accountant going over the bills which he\nhas heaped on the table.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tThe news of His Majesty's disregard\n\twere not long in getting around,\n\tand, in a very short time, all the\n\tbills came down upon me together --\n\tall the bills I had been contracting\n\tfor the years of my marriage.  I\n\twon't cite their amount; it was\n\tfrightful.  I was bound up in an\n\tinextricable toil of bills and\n\tdebts, or mortgages and insurances,\n\tand all the horrible evils attendant\n\tupon them.\n\nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GROUNDS - DAY\n\nRoderick walking alone.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tWas it my own want of style, or my\n\twant of a fortune?  I know not.  Now\n\tI was arrived at the height of my\n\tambition, but both my skill and my\n\tluck seemed to be deserting me.\n\tEverything I touched, crumbled in my\n\thands; every speculation I had,\n\tfailed; every agent I trusted,\n\tdeceived me.  My income was saddled\n\twith hundreds of annuities, and\n\tthousands of lawyers' charges, and I\n\tfelt the net drawing closer and\n\tcloser around me, and no means to\n\textricate myself from its toils.\n\tAll my schemes had turned out\n\tfailures.\n\nINT.  LONDON GAMING CLUB - NIGHT\n\nRoderick at the gaming table.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tMy wife's moody despondency made my\n\thouse and home not over-pleasant;\n\thence, I was driven a good deal\n\tabroad, where as play was the\n\tfashion in every club, tavern, and\n\tassembly, I, of course, was obliged\n\tto resume my old habit, and to\n\tcommence as an amateur those games\n\tat which I was once unrivaled in\n\tEurope.\n\nRoderick loses a large amount of money.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI had a run of ill-luck at play, and\n\twas forced to meet my losses by the\n\tmost shameful sacrifices to the\n\tmoney-lenders, and was compelled to\n\tborrow largely upon my wife's\n\tannuities, ensuring her ladyship's\n\tlife, which was the condition for\n\tevery loan against her property.\n\nINT.  LONDON OFFICE - INSURANCE BROKER - DAY\n\nRoderick and the broker.\n\n\t\t\tBROKER\n\tYour wife's life is as well known\n\tamong the insurance societies in\n\tLondon, as any woman in Christendom,\n\tand, I'm sorry to say there is not\n\tone of them willing to place another\n\tpolicy against her ladyship's life.\n\tOne of them even had the impudence\n\tto suggest that your treatment of\n\tthe Countess did not render her life\n\tworth a year's purchase.\n\nEXT.  STUD FARM - DAY\n\nRoderick buying a horse.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tIn the midst of my difficulties, I\n\tpromised to buy a little horse for\n\tmy dear little Patrick, which was to\n\tbe a present for his eighth\n\tbirthday, that was now coming on.  I\n\tmay have had my faults, but no man\n\tshall dare to say of me that I was\n\tnot a good and tender father.\n\nRoderick admires the horse.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tIt was a beautiful little animal,\n\tand stood me in a good sum.  I never\n\tregarded money for that dear child.\n\nEXT.  ROAD - DAY\n\nThe horse kicks off one of the horse-boys who tries to\nride him.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tBut the horse was a bit wild, and he\n\tkicked off one of the horse-boys who\n\trode him at first, and broke the\n\tlad's leg.\n\nEXT.  ROAD - DAY\n\nRoderick riding the horse.  The horse-boy lies in the back\nof a wagon.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tBut he was a beautiful animal and\n\twould make a fine horse for Patrick\n\tafter he had a bit of breaking-in.\n\nEXT.  ROAD - NEAR CASTLE HACKTON - DAY\n\nRoderick dismounts and gives the horse to one of the\nhorse-boys.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tTimmy, take the injured lad to see\n\tthe doctor, and then bring the horse\n\tto Doolan's farm, and tell him to\n\tbreak him in thoroughly.  Tell him\n\tit's for little Patrick, and that\n\tI'll be over to see him next week.\n\n\t\t\tHORSE-BOY\n\tYes, sir.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tOne more thing, and listen well, I\n\tdon't want little Patrick to know\n\twhere the horse is being kept.  It's\n\tgoing to be surprise for his\n\tbirthday.\n\nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY\n\nPatrick rushes out to greet his father.\n\n\t\t\tPATRICK\n\tHello, papa!\n\nRoderick picks him up in his arms, and kisses him.\n\n\t\t\tPATRICK\n\tDid you buy the horse, papa?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tNow, just have a little patience, my\n\tboy.  Your birthday isn't until next\n\tweek.\n\n\t\t\tPATRICK\n\tBut I will have it on my birthday,\n\twon't I?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tWell, we'll just have to wait and\n\tsee, won't we?\n\nHe walks up the steps holding Patrick, who hugs and kisses\nhim.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tMy son, little Patrick Cosgrove, was\n\ta prince; his breeding and manners,\n\teven at his early age, showed him to\n\tbe worthy of the two noble families\n\tfrom whom he was descended, and I\n\tdon't know what high hopes I had for\n\tthe boy, and indulged in a thousand\n\tfond anticipations as to his future\n\tsuccess and figure in the world, but\n\tstern Fate had determined that I\n\tshould leave none of my race behind\n\tme.\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nRoderick is drunk.  Patrick is brought in by his governor,\nHunt, to say good night.

Is that true, papa?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (angered)\n\tWhat the devil?  What kind of fools\n\tdo we have here?  Pottle, who told\n\tthe lad this story?\n\n\t\t\tHUNT\n\tI don't know, sir.\n\n\t\t\tPATRICK\n\tThen it's true!  It's true!  Oh,\n\tthank you, papa!  Thank you!\n\nHe hugs his father.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tPromise me, Patrick, that you will\n\tnot ride the horse except in the\n\tcompany of your father.\n\n\t\t\tPATRICK\n\t\t   (unconvincingly)\n\tI promise, mama.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI promise your lordship a good\n\tflogging if you even so much as go\n\tto Doolan's farm to see him.\n\n\t\t\tPATRICK\n\tYes, papa.\n\nINT.  RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\nRoderick is awakened by his valet and Hunt, the governor.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tYes...?\n\n\t\t\tVALET\n\tI'm sorry to disturb you, sir, but\n\tMr. Hunt has something important to\n\ttell you.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tYes?\n\n\t\t\tHUNT\n\tI think Master Patrick has disobeyed\n\tyour orders and stolen off to\n\tDoolan's farm.  When I went to the\n\tlad's room this morning, his bed was\n\tempty.  One of the cooks said she\n\tsaw him go away before daybreak.  He\n\tmust have slipped through my room\n\twhile I was asleep.\n\nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STABLES - DAY\n\nRoderick, in a rage, taking a great horse-whip, gallops\noff after the child.\n\nEXT.  ROAD - CASTLE HACKTON - DAY\n\nRoderick comes upon a sad procession of farmers, moaning\nand howling, the black horse led by the hand, and, on a\ndoor that some of them carry, little Patrick.  He lies in\nhis little boots and spurs, and his little coat of scarlet\nand gold.  His face is quite white, and he smiles as he\nholds a hand out to Roderick and says painfully:\n\n\t\t\tPATRICK\n\tYou won't whip me, will you, papa?\n\nRoderick bursts out into tears in reply.\n\nINT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nSome doctors around the bed, Roderick and the Countess\nanxiously waiting upon them.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tThe doctors were called, but what\n\tdoes a doctor avail in a contest\n\twith the grim, invincible enemy?\n\tSuch as came could only confirm our\n\tdespair by their account of the poor\n\tchild's case.  His spine was\n\tinjured, the lower half of him was\n\tdead when they laid him in bed at\n\thome.  The rest did not last long,\n\tGod help me!  He remained yet for\n\ttwo days with us, and a sad comfort\n\tit was to think he was in no pain.\n\nINT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\nRoderick, Countess and Patrick.\n\n\t\t\tPATRICK\n\t\t   (weakly)\n\tPapa, I beg you and mama to pardon\n\tme for any acts of disobedience I\n\thave been guilty of towards you.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\t\t   (weeping)\n\tOh, my little angel, you have done\n\tnothing for which you need pardon.\n\n\t\t\tPATRICK\n\tWhere is Brooksy?  I would like to\n\tsee him.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tYour bother is in America fighting\n\tthe rebels.\n\n\t\t\tPATRICK\n\tIs he all right, papa?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tYes, he's fine.\n\n\t\t\tPATRICK\n\tBrooksy was better than you, papa,\n\the used not to swear so, and he\n\ttaught me many good things while you\n\twere away.\n\nPatrick takes a hand of his mother and of Roderick, in\neach of his little clammy ones.\n\n\t\t\tPATRICK\n\tI beg you not to quarrel so, but to\n\tlove each other, so that we might\n\tmeet again in heaven where Brooksy\n\ttold me quarrelsome people never go.\n\nHis mother is much affected by these admonitions, and\nRoderick is too.\n\nPatrick gives Roderick a ring from his finger, and a\nlocket to his mother.\n\nHe says that these gifts are so that they will not forget\nhim.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tAt last, after two days, he died.\n\tThere he lay, the hope of my family,\n\tthe pride of my manhood, the link\n\twhich kept me and my Lady Cosgrove\n\ttogether.\n\nEXT.  CHURCH - GRAVEYARD - DAY\n\nFuneral.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI won't tell you with what splendor\n\twe buried him, but what avail are\n\tundertakers' feathers and heralds'\n\ttrumpery.\n\nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STABLE - DAY\n\nRoderick enters the stable and, after a few seconds, we\nhear a pistol shot.  He exits rapidly, the smoking pistol\nstill in his hand.\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - VARIOUS - DAY AND NIGHT\n\nThe Countess:  Praying.  Waking up screaming.  Fits of\ncrying.  Severely depressed.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tLady Cosgrove, always vaporish and\n\tnervous, after our blessed boy's\n\tcatastrophe, became more agitated\n\tthan ever, and plunged into devotion\n\twith so much fervor that you would\n\thave fancied her almost distracted\n\tat times.\n\nCountess sees visions.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tShe imagined she saw visions.  She\n\tsaid an angel from heaven told her\n\tthat Patrick's death was a\n\tpunishment to her for her neglect of\n\ther firstborn.  Then she would\n\tdeclare that Brookside was dead.\n\nINT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY\n\nRoderick and his accountant.  Bills, bills, bills.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tBy now, my financial affairs were\n\tnear to ruin.  I could not get a\n\tguinea from any money-dealer in\n\tLondon.  Our rents were in the hands\n\tof receivers by this time, and it\n\twas as much as I could do to get\n\tenough money from the rascals to pay\n\tmy wine-merchants their bills.  Our\n\tproperty was hampered, and often as\n\tI applied to my lawyers and agents\n\tfor money, would come a reply\n\tdemanding money of me for debts and\n\tpretended claims which the rapacious\n\trascals said they had on me.\n\nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY\n\nMother arrives.  Roderick greets her.  Servants unload her\nbags.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tMy mother was the only person who,\n\tin my misfortune, remained faithful\n\tto me -- indeed, she has always\n\tspoken of me in my true light, as a\n\tmartyr to the rascality of others,\n\tand a victim of my own generous and\n\tconfiding temper.\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY\n\nMother supervising kitchen staff.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tShe was an invaluable person to me\n\tin my house, which would have been\n\tat rack and ruin before, but for her\n\tspirit of order and management and\n\ther excellent economy in the\n\tgovernment of my rapidly dwindling\n\thousehold staff.\n\nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY\n\nRoderick and his mother.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tIf anything could have saved me from\n\tthe consequences of villainy in\n\tothers, it would have been the\n\tadmirable prudence of that worthy\n\tcreature.\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nAction as per voice over.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tShe never went to bed until all the\n\thouse was quiet and all the candles\n\tout; you may fancy that this was a\n\tmatter of some difficulty with a man\n\tof my habits who had commonly a\n\tdozen of jovial fellows to drink\n\twith me every night, and who\n\tseldom, for my part, went to bed\n\tsober.\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nActions as per voice over.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tMany and many a night, when I was\n\tunconscious of her attention, has\n\tthat good soul pulled my boots off,\n\tand seen me laid by my servants snug\n\tin bed, and carried off the candle\n\therself...\n\nINT.

It was my mother's\n\tpride that I could drink more than\n\tany man in the country.\n\nINT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - NIGHT\n\nRoderick and his mother holding a letter before a fire,\nwhich slowly brings out the writing in lemon juice between\nthe widely-spaced lines of directions to her milliner.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tMy mother discovered that always,\n\tbefore my lady-wife chose to write\n\tletters to her milliner, she had\n\tneed of lemons to make her drink, as\n\tshe said, and this fact, being\n\tmentioned to me, kind of set me\n\ta-thinking.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (reading letter\n\t\t    aloud)\n\t\"This day, three years ago, my last\n\thope and pleasure in life was taken\n\tfrom me, and my dear child was\n\tcalled to Heaven.  Where is his\n\tneglected brother, whom I suffered\n\tto grow up unheeded by my side, and\n\twhom the tyranny of the monster to\n\twhom I am united drove to exile,\n\tand, perhaps to death?  I pray the\n\tchild is still alive and safe.\n\tCharles Brookside!  Come to the aide\n\tof a wretched mother, who\n\tacknowledges her crime, her coldness\n\ttowards you, and now bitterly pays\n\tfor her error!  What sufferings,\n\twhat humiliations have I had to\n\tendure!  I am a prisoner in my own\n\thalls.  I should fear poison, but\n\tthen I know the wretch has a sordid\n\tinterest in keeping me alive, and\n\tthat my death would be the signal\n\tfor his ruin.  But I dare not stir\n\twithout my odious, hideous, vulgar\n\tgaoler, the horrid Irish woman, who\n\tpurses my every step.  I am locked\n\tinto my chamber at night, like a\n\tfelon, and only suffered to leave it\n\twhen ordered into the presence of my\n\tlord, to be present at his orgies\n\twith his boon-companions, and to\n\thear his odious converse as he\n\tlapses into the disgusting madness\n\tof intoxication.\"\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nRoderick, and the Countess and mother, at a silent dinner.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tIt was not possible to recover the\n\tname for whom the note was intended,\n\tbut it was clear that, to add to all\n\tmy perplexities, three years after\n\tmy poor child's death, my wife,\n\twhose vagaries of temper and wayward\n\tfollies I had borne with for twelve\n\tyears, wanted to leave me.  I\n\tdecided it best not to reveal to her\n\tladyship our discovery, that we\n\tmight still intercept and uncover\n\tfurther schemes with might be afoot.\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - VARIOUS - DAY AND NIGHT\n\nA few cuts showing Mother keeping an eye on the Countess.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tYet I was bound to be on my guard\n\tthat she should not give me the\n\tslip.  Had she left me, I was ruined\n\tthe next day.  I set my mother to\n\tkeep sharp watch over the moods of\n\ther ladyship, and you may be sure\n\tthat her assistance and surveillance\n\twere invaluable to me.  If I had\n\tpaid twenty spies to watch her lady,\n\tI should not have been half so well\n\tserved as by the disinterested care\n\tand watchfulness of my excellent\n\tmother.\n\nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDENS - DAY\n\nRoderick walking with the Countess.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tMy Lady Cosgrove's relationship with\n\tme was a singular one.  Her life was\n\tpassed in a series of crack-brained\n\tsort of alternation between love and\n\thatred for me.  We would quarrel for\n\ta fortnight, then we should be\n\tfriends for a month together\n\tsometimes.  One day, I was joking\n\ther, and asking her whether she\n\twould take the water again, whether\n\tshe had found another lover, and so\n\tforth.  She suddenly burst out into\n\ttears, and, after a while, said to\n\tme:\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tRoderick, you know well enough that\n\tI have never loved but you!  Was I\n\tever so wretched that a kind word\n\tfrom you did not make me happy?\n\tEver so angry, but the least offer\n\tof good-will on your part did not\n\tbring me to your side?  Did I not\n\tgive a sufficient proof of my\n\taffection for you in bestowing one\n\tof the finest fortunes of England\n\tupon you?  Have I repined or rebuked\n\tyou for the way you have wasted it?\n\tNo, I loved you too much and too\n\tfondly; I have always loved you.\n\tFrom the first moment I saw you, I\n\tsaw your bad qualities, and trembled\n\tat your violence; but I could not\n\thelp loving you.  I married you,\n\tthough I knew I was sealing my own\n\tfate in doing so, and in spite of\n\treason and duty.  What sacrifice do\n\tyou want from me?  I am ready to\n\tmake any, so you will but love me,\n\tor, if not, that at least, you will\n\tgently us me.\n\nRoderick kisses her.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI was in a particularly good humor\n\tthat day, and we had a sort of\n\treconciliation.\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT\n\nRoderick and his mother.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER\n\tDepend on it, artful hussy has some\n\tother scheme in her head now.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tThe old lady was right, and I\n\tswallowed the bait which her\n\tladyship had prepared to entrap me\n\tas simply as any gudgeon takes a\n\thook.\n\nEXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY\n\nArrival of Mr. Newcombe, the money-broker.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI had hired a money-broker\n\tespecially to find some means of my\n\tmaking a loan.  After several months\n\twithout success, it was with some\n\tconsiderable interest that I\n\treceived his visit.\n\nINT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY\n\nRoderick and the money-broker, Mr. Newcombe.\n\n\t\t\tNEWCOMBE\n\tI have good news for you, Mr.\n\tCosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle\n\tand Chatwick, in the city of London,\n\tare prepared to lend you 20,000\n\tpounds, pledged against your\n\tinterest in the Edric mines.  They\n\twill redeem the encumbrances against\n\tthe property, which amount to some\n\t10,000 pounds, and take a twenty-\n\tyear working lease on the mines.\n\tThey will lend you the 20,000 pounds\n\tagainst the lease income,\n\twhich they will apply to the loan as\n\tit comes in, and they will make a\n\tcharge of 18% per annum interest on\n\tthe outstanding loan balance.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tMr. Newcombe, I have made some\n\tdifficult loans during the past few\n\tyears, at very onerous terms, but\n\t18% a year interest seems very stiff\n\tindeed.\n\n\t\t\tNEWCOMBE\n\tConsidering your financial\n\tcircumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has\n\tbeen impossible to find anyone at\n\tall prepared to do any business with\n\tyou.  I think you may count yourself\n\tlucky to have this opportunity.\n\tBut, obviously, if you would reject\n\tthis offer, I shall keep trying to\n\tfind a better one.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\t\t   (after a pause)\n\tI am prepared to accept the terms,\n\tMr. Newcombe.\n\n\t\t\tNEWCOMBE\n\tThere are a few other points we\n\tshould discuss.  The loan agreement\n\tcan only be executed by her\n\tladyship's signature, and provided\n\tthat Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be\n\tassured of her ladyship's freewill\n\tin giving her signature.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tProvided that they can be assured of\n\ther ladyship's freewill?  Are you\n\tserious?\n\n\t\t\tNEWCOMBE\n\tMay I be quite frank with you?\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tYes, of course.\n\n\t\t\tNEWCOMBE\n\tMister Bracegirdle said to me that\n\the had heard her ladyship lives in\n\tsome fear of her life, and meditated\n\ta separation, in which case, she\n\tmight later repudiate any documents\n\tsigned by herself while in durance,\n\tand subject them, at any rate, to a\n\tdoubtful and expensive litigation.\n\tThey were quite insistent on this\n\tpoint, and said they must have\n\tabsolute assurance of her ladyship's\n\tperfect freewill in the transaction\n\tbefore they would advance a shilling\n\tof their capital.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tI see.\n\n\t\t\tNEWCOMBE\n\tWhen I asked them in what form they\n\twould accept her ladyship's\n\tassurances, they said that they were\n\tonly prepared to accept them if her\n\tladyship confirms her written\n\tconsent by word of mouth, in their\n\tpresence, at their counting-house in\n\tBirchin Lane, London.  I requested\n\tthey come here, and save her\n\tladyship and yourself the\n\tinconvenience of the trip to London,\n\tbut they declined, saying that they\n\tdid not wish to incur the risk of a\n\tvisit to Castle Hackton to\n\tnegotiate, as they were aware of how\n\tother respectable parties, such as\n\tMessrs. Sharp and Salomon had been\n\ttreated here.\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY\n\nRoderick and his mother.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER\n\tDepend on it, there is some\n\tartifice.

If you are\n\ttaken in London, and thrown into\n\tprison, your case is hopeless.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tMother dear, we are now living off\n\tour own beef and mutton.  We have to\n\twatch Lady Cosgrove within and the\n\tbailiffs without.  There are certain\n\tsituations in which people cannot\n\tdictate their own terms; and faith,\n\twe are so pressed now for money,\n\tthat I would sign a bond with old\n\tNick himself, if he would provide a\n\tgood round sum.  With this money, we\n\tcan settle our principal debts and\n\tmake a fresh start.\n\n\t\t\tMOTHER\n\tRoderick, you must listen to me.  As\n\tsoon as they have you in London,\n\tthey will get the better of my poor\n\tinnocent lad; and the first thing\n\tthat I shall hear of you will be\n\tthat you are in trouble.  You will\n\tbe a victim of your own generous and\n\tconfiding nature.\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' BEDROOM\n\nRoderick and the Countess.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tWhy go, Roderick?

The thought of the money quite\n\tput me in a good humor, and my wife,\n\tas she lay on my shoulder in the\n\tpost-chaise, going to London, said\n\tit was the happiest ride she had\n\ttaken since our marriage.\n\nEXT.  INN - DUSK\n\nThe carriage stops and they disembark.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tOne night we stayed at Reading.\n\nINT.  INN - NIGHT\n\nRoderick and his wife at dinner.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tMy lady and I agreed that, with the\n\tmoney, we would go to France, and\n\twait there for better times, and\n\tthat night, over our supper, formed\n\ta score of plans both for pleasure\n\tand retrenchment.  You would have\n\tthought it was Darby and Joan\n\ttogether over their supper.\n\nINT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nRoderick and his wife making love.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tO woman!  Woman!  When I recollect\n\tLady Cosgrove's smiles and\n\tblandishments, how happy she seemed\n\tto be on that night!  What an air of\n\tinnocent confidence appeared in her\n\tbehavior, and what affectionate\n\tnames she called me!  I am lost in\n\twonder at the depth of her\n\thypocrisy.  Who can be surprised\n\tthat an unsuspecting person like\n\tmyself should have been a victim to\n\tsuch a consummate deceiver?\n\nEXT.  GRAY'S INN OFFICE - DAY\n\nThe coach drives up.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tWe were in London at three o'clock,\n\tan half-an-hour before the time\n\tappointed.\n\nINT.  STAIRCASE - DAY\n\nRoderick and the Countess looking for the office.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI easily found out Mr. Tapewell's\n\tapartment:  a gloomy den it was, and\n\tin an unlucky hour, I entered it.\n\nThey climb up dirty backstairs, lit by a feeble lamp, and\nthe dim sky of a dismal London afternoon.\n\nThe Countess seems agitated and faint.\n\nWhen they get to the door, she stops in front of it.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tRoderick -- don't go in.  I am sure\n\tthere is danger.  There's time yet,\n\tlet us go back -- anywhere!\n\nThe Countess has put herself before the door in a\ntheatrical attitude and takes Roderick's hand.\n\nHe pushes her away to one side.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tLady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tOld fool!\n\nShe jumps at the bell, which is quickly answered by a\nmoldy-looking gentleman in an unpowered wig.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tSay Lady Cosgrove is here!\n\nShe stalks down the passage, muttering:  \"Old Fool.\"\n\nINT.  MR. TAPEWELL'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nTapewell is in his musty room, surrounded by his\nparchments and tin boxes.\n\nHe advances and bows, begs her ladyship to be seated, and\npoints towards a chair for Roderick, which he takes,\nrather wondering at the lawyer's insolence.\n\nThe lawyer retreats to a side-door, saying he will be back\nin a moment.\n\nIn the next moment, he reenters, bringing with him another\nlayer, six constables in red waist-coats, with bludgeons\nand pistols, and Lord Brookside.\n\nLady Cosgrove flings herself into the arms of her son,\ncrying and whimpering and calling him her savior, her\npreserver, her gallant knight.\n\nThen, turning to Roderick, she pours out a flood of\ninvective which quite astonishes him.\n\n\t\t\tCOUNTESS\n\tOh fool as I am, I have outwitted\n\tthe most crafty and treacherous\n\tmonster under the sun.  Yes, I was a\n\tfool when I married you, and gave up\n\tother and nobler hearts for your\n\tsake -- yes, I was a fool when I\n\tforgot my name and lineage to unite\n\tmyself with a base-born adventurer\n\t-- a fool to bear, without repining,\n\tthe most monstrous tyranny that ever\n\twoman suffered; to allow my property\n\tto be squandered; to see women as\n\tbase and low-born as yourself...\n\n\t\t\tTAPEWELL\n\tFor heaven's sake, be calm.\n\nTapewell bounds back behind the constables, seeing a\nthreatening look in Roderick's eye.\n\nThe Countess continues in a strain of incoherent fury,\nscreaming against Roderick, and against his mother, and\nalways beginning and ending the sentence with the word\n\"fool.\"\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tYou didn't tell all, my lady -- I\n\tsaid \"old\" fool.\n\n\t\t\tBROOKSIDE\n\tI have no doubt that you said and\n\tdid, sir, everything that a\n\tblackguard could say or do.  This\n\tlady is now safe under the\n\tprotection of her relations and the\n\tlaw, and need fear your infamous\n\tpersecutions no longer.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tBut you are not safe, and as sure as\n\tI am a man of honor, I will have\n\tyour heart's blood.\n\n\t\t\tTAPEWELL\n\tTake down his words, constables;\n\tswear the peace against him.\n\n\t\t\tBROOKSIDE\n\tI would not sully my sword with the\n\tblood of such a ruffian.  If the\n\tscoundrel remains in London another\n\tday, he will be seized as a common\n\tswindler.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tWhere's the man who will seize me?\n\nHe draws his sword, placing his back to the door.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tLet the scoundrel come!  You -- you\n\tcowardly braggart, come first, if\n\tyou have the soul of a man!\n\nThe Countess and the bailiffs move away.\n\n\t\t\tTAPEWELL\n\tWe are not going to seize you!  My\n\tdear sir, we don't wish to seize\n\tyou; we will give you a handsome sum\n\tto leave the country, only leave her\n\tladyship in peace.\n\n\t\t\tBROOKSIDE\n\tAnd the country will be rid of such\n\ta villain.\n\nAs Brookside says this, he backs into the next room.\n\nThe lawyer follows him, leaving Roderick alone in the\ncompany of the constables who are all armed to the teeth.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI was no longer the man I was at\n\ttwenty, when I should have charged\n\tthe ruffians, sword in hand, and\n\tsent at least one of them to his\n\taccount.  I was broken in spirit,\n\tregularly caught in the toils,\n\tutterly baffled and beaten by that\n\twoman.  Was she relenting at the\n\tdoor, when she paused and begged me\n\tto turn back?  Had she not a\n\tlingering love for me still?  Her\n\tconduct showed it, as I came to\n\treflect on it.  It was my only\n\tchance now left in the world, so I\n\tput down my sword upon the lawyers\n\tdesk.\n\nRoderick puts his sword down on the lawyer's desk.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tGentlemen, I shall have no violence;\n\tyou may tell Mr. Tapewell I am quite\n\tready to speak with him when he is\n\tat leisure.\n\nRoderick sits down and folds his arms quite peaceably.\n\nEXT.  COFFEE HOUSE - NEAR GRAY'S INN - DAY\n\nINT.  RODERICK'S ROOM IN COFFEE HOUSE - DAY\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK (V.O.)\n\tI was instructed to take a lodging\n\tfor the night in a coffee house near\n\tGray's Inn, and anxiously expected a\n\tvisit from Mr. Tapewell.\n\nTapewell talking to Roderick.\n\n\t\t\tTAPEWELL\n\tI have been authorized by Lady\n\tCosgrove and her advisors to pay you\n\tan annuity of 300 pounds a year,\n\tspecifically on the condition of you\n\tremaining abroad out of the three\n\tkingdoms, and to be stopped on the\n\tinstant of your return.  I advise\n\tyou to accept it without delay for\n\tyou know, as well as I do, that your\n\tstay in London will infallibly\n\tplunge you in gaol, as there are\n\tinnumerable writs taken out against\n\tyou here and in the west of England,\n\tand that your credit is so blown\n\tupon that you could not hope to\n\traise a shilling.  I will leave you\n\tthe night to consider this proposal,\n\tbut if you refuse, the family will\n\tproceed against you in London, and\n\thave you arrested.  If you accede, a\n\tquarter salary will be paid to you\n\tat any foreign port you should\n\tprefer.\n\n\t\t\tRODERICK\n\tMr. Tapewell, I do not require a\n\tnight to consider this proposal.\n\tWhat other choice has a poor, lonely\n\tand broken-hearted man?  I shall\n\ttake the annuity, and leave the\n\tcountry.\n\n\t\t\tMR. TAPEWELL\n\tI am very glad to hear that you have\n\tcome to this decision, Mr. Cosgrove.\n\tI think you are very wise.\n\nThere is a knock at the door and Roderick opens it.\nBrookside enters with four constables armed with pistols.\n\nThe dialogue for this scene has to be written.\n\nBrookside has gone against the bargain, and has decided to\nhave Roderick arrested upon one of the many writs out\nagainst him for debt.\n\nMr. Tapewell is surprised and complains weakly that\nBrookside is acting in bad faith.\n\nBrookside brushes aside his objections.\n\nRoderick is defeated, and meekly sits down in a chair.\n\nThe following lines are read over Roderick being shackled\nand led out of the room.\n\n\t\t\tNARRATOR\n\tMr. James Cosgrove's personal\n\tnarrative finishes here, for the\n\thand of death interrupted the\n\tingenious author soon after the\n\tperiod which this memoir was\n\tcompiled, after he had lived\n\tnineteen years an inmate of the\n\tFleet Prison, where the prison\n\trecords state he died of delirium\n\ttremens.\n\nEXT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY\n\nHis mother, now very old and hobbled with arthritis,\nenters the prison, carrying a basket on her arm.\n\n\t\t\tNARRATOR\n\tHis faithful old mother joined him\n\tin his lonely exile, and had a\n\tbedroom in Fleet Market over the\n\tway.  She would come and stay the\n\twhole day with him in prison\n\tworking.\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' STUDY\n\nSigning a payment draft, the Countess sighs and gazes out\nof the large window.\n\n\t\t\tNARRATOR\n\tThe Countess was never out of love\n\twith her husband, and, as long as\n\tshe lived, James enjoyed his income\n\tof 300 pounds per year and was,\n\tperhaps, as happy in prison, as at\n\tany period of his existence.\n\nINT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STUDY - DAY\n\nBrookside tearing up the payment draft presented to him by\nhis accountant.\n\n\t\t\tNARRATOR\n\tWhen her ladyship died, her son\n\tsternly cut off the annuity,\n\tdevoting the sum to charities,\n\twhich, he said, would make a nobler\n\tuse of it than the scoundrel who had\n\tenjoyed it hitherto.\n\nINT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY\n\nRoderick, now grey-haired, blacking boots.\n\n\t\t\tNARRATOR\n\tWhen the famous character lost his\n\tincome, his spirit entirely failed.\n\tHe was removed into the pauper's\n\tward, where he was known to black\n\tboots for wealthier prisoners, and\n\twhere he was detected in stealing a\n\ttobacco box.\n\nINT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY\n\nRoderick and his mother.  Action as per voice over.\n\n\t\t\tNARRATOR\n\tHis mother attained a prodigious old\n\tage, and the inhabitants of the\n\tplace in her time can record, with\n\taccuracy, the daily disputes which\n\tused to take place between mother\n\tand son, until the latter, from\n\thabits of intoxication, falling into\n\ta state of almost imbecility, was\n\ttended by his tough old parent as a\n\tbaby almost, and would cry if\n\tdeprived of his necessary glass of\n\tbrandy.\n\nTITLE CARD\n\n\tIt was in the reign of George III\n\tthat the above-named personages\n\tlived and quarreled; good or bad,\n\thandsome or ugly, rich or poor, they\n\tare all equal now.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t    FADE OUT.\n\n\t\t\tTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarry Lyndon\nWriters :   Stanley Kubrick\nGenres :   Drama  Romance  War\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n"

The sky is a glorious explosion of blue and\nmauve and lavender. The setting sun washes the clouds with a delicate\npink tint. The bird swoops and spirals and we are right there with\nhim. Then suddenly, below us, an extraordinary sight appears.\n\n2\tEXT: LABYRINTH - DAY\n\nIt is the labyrinth, an enormous maze of incredible mandala like\nintricacy. From our magnificent vantage point, WE ARE BARELY ABLE TO\nMAKE OUT its details: the twisting walls interrupted here and there\nby lush forest, the complex web of waterways, the forbidding castle\nat the core. It is vast and magical, frightening and compelling at\nthe same time. We would love to linger, perhaps fly lower and get a\nbetter look at this wondrous place, but the bird flies on\n\n3\tEXT: GLADE - DAY\n\nIt is an idyllic setting, warm and inviting. The late afternoon sun\nwashes everything with a pink glow. Between the water and a line of\nlush fruit trees is a flower-strewn glade. A FIGURE emerges from the\ntrees and walks toward the water. It is a YOUNG WOMAN dressed in a\nflowing white dress that swirls around her in the breeze. The pink\nlight burnishes her hair and causes a gold circlet she wears on her\nhead to glow. She is breathtaking, a vision of innocence and grace.\nShe stops to pick a flower and then turns suddenly as if she has\nheard something.\n\nGIRL: Is it you?\n\nShe takes a few hurried steps and then stops, smiling shyly\n\nGIRL: Your Highness!\n\nThe GIRL curtsies deeply and then looks up through lowered lashes,\nthe shy smile still dancing on her lips. And then WE PULL BACK TO\nREVEAL a crown perched on a head of tight curls. WE ARE LOOKING\nTHROUGH the crown at the girl as she rises slowly, then looks boldly\nat the PRINCE.\n\nGIRL: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my lord.\nFor though my father, the Duke, has promised you my hand, I cannot\nconsent to be yours until the evil that stalks our land from highest\nhill to deepest dale is ...\n\nSuddenly the GIRL stops speaking, a look of stunned confusion on her\nface.\n\nGIRL: ... from highest hill to deepest dale ... (her brow furrows in\nconcentration and then) Damn!\n\nShe burrows one hand into the deep sleeve of her gown and pulls out a\nrolled-up soft-cover book. She rifles through the pages.\n\nThe PRINCE is not a prince at all, but a SHEEPDOG wearing a tin foil\ncrown. He thinks his work is over and it's time to play and he lunges\nhappily towards the GIRL who isn't a princess or even a duchess, but\n15-year-old SARAH.\n\nSARAH is knocked over by the playful DOG. Beneath the gown which WE\nCAN NOW SEE is homemade and not very grand at all, WE SEE faded jeans\nand running shoes.\n\nSARAH: Get off me, you monster!!\n\nThe DOG grabs the book out of her hand and runs away with it, hoping\nto be chased. SARAH doesn't follow, she just sits up and pulls the\ngrass out of her tangled hair and sighs with frustration. The DOG\ncomes back over to SARAH, its tail wagging hopefully.\n\nSARAH: If you value your mangy life, Merlin, you'll hand it over.\n\nThe DOG obediently drops the book.\n\nTHE BOOK\n\nOn the cover it says, _MEANDER'S QUEEN a play in three acts by Robin\nZakar_. SARAH reaches for it and we hear a clock tower begin to chime.\n\nSARAH leaps to her feet.\n\nSARAH: Oh no, Merlin! We're really late! Why does everything have to\nhappen to me!!!?\n\nMERLIN prances around her happily, his foil crown in his mouth. SARAH\npulls it out of his mouth and throws it in a nearby trash basket. He\nrushes after it and peers into the basket, wanting to fetch.\n\nSARAH: It's all your fault, you miserable mutt!!\n\nShe hikes up her dress and runs into the trees. MERLIN whimpers and\ntags along behind her.\n\n4\tEXT: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TREES - DAY\n\nSARAH comes bursting through the trees and runs down a hill toward\nthe street. WE PULL BACK and WE CAN SEE an enormous steel mill on the\nother side of the river. And now WE NOTICE that the light isn't pink\nany more but sort of dull and hazy, and the idyllic glade is barely a\nsuburban park, and this is just an ordinary day in a very ordinary\nplace.\n\n5\tEXT: AN OLD RAMBLING HOUSE - DUSK\n\nSARAH runs up a path to an older, rambling house. She goes through\nthe front door, MERLIN hot on her heels, and neither one of them sees\nthe beautiful SNOW-WHITE BIRD that lands in a tree beside the path.\n\n6\tINT: INSIDE THE ROUSE - EVENING\n\nSARAH bursts through the front door and makes a beeline for the\nstairs. She almost makes it. SARAH'S MOTHER appears in the hallway.\n\nMOTHER: _Sarah_, where have you been?!!!\n\nSARAH abruptly stops and changes to an elegantly graceful ascension\nof the stairs.\n\nSARAH (in an affected voice): I can't talk to you now. I'm in\nrehearsal.\n\nShe continues grandly on and heads for her room.\n\nMOTHER: You were supposed to be home an hour ago to baby-sit for\nFreddie! Don't we at least deserve an explanation?\n\nSARAH stops and leans over the railing. She speaks with a\nmelodramatic solemnity.\n\nSARAH: As Meander's Queen, I've been ... meandering. Dither me not\nabout explanations.\n\nWith that she turns and heads for her room. On the door is a sign\nthat says: \"Admittance by Invitation Only.\" SARAH'S FATHER comes into\nthe hall.\n\nFATHER: What's that all about?\n\nMOTHER: It's a part in a play, (raising her voice) but that's no\nreason to...\n\nSARAH turns in her doorway. She calls down.\n\nSARAH: Chasten not your Queen, _Peasant_!\n\nShe dramatically sweeps into her room.\n\n7\tINT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nSARAH slams the door and leans against it, playing the scene.\n\nFATHER (VO): _Sarah_, that's no way to talk to your mother!\n\nSARAH (mumbles to herself): She's not my mother.\n\nSARAH takes a deep breath and closes her eyes. She can hear footsteps\nand SOMEONE comes to the other side of the door.\n\nSARAH ignores her STEPMOTHER and kicks off her running shoes.\n\nWith a practiced gesture SARAH removes her jeans while leaving her\ngown in place.\n\nSTEPMOTHER (VO): _Sarah_, when I tell you to be home at five, I\nexpect you to be home at five.\n\nSARAH quickly shifts to her STEPMOTHER's attitude -- hands on hips,\nand silently mimes her words.\n\nSARAH: Yes, Madame!\n\n7A\tINT: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY\n\nSTEPMOTHER: And don't \"Yes Madame\" me!\n\nFATHER: Is she all right?\n\nSTEPMOTHER (frustrated): Of course she's all right! I left the\nBernsteins' number on the kitchen table ... Freddie might be coming\ndown with a cold so call us if he seems even the least bit\nuncomfortable ...\n\nSARAH (VO) (sighs): Yes, Mother.\n\nSTEPMOTHER: Oh! I give up!\n\nShe hurries down the stairs.\n\nFATHER: We'll see you later, baby. And remember ...\n\n7B\tINT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nSARAH speaks along with him, mimicking.\n\nSARAH & FATHER (VO): Don't open the door to strangers.\n\nWe hear him leave. SARAH waits a beat and then turns and opens her\nbedroom door.\n\nSARAH: And don't call me baby! (she slams the door shut; mimicking\nher parents) Precious little Freddie might be coming down with a cold\n...\n\nShe sighs and looks around. This is really her world, her retreat,\nand she knows and controls every inch of it. The shelves are filled\nwith an orderly array of childhood dolls and toys. The books are\nlined up neatly in the bookcase and if we could see them up close we\nwould see that they were placed in alphabetical order -- and\naccording to the year they were acquired. She walks over to her\ndresser. She checks herself out in the mirror above the chest of\ndrawers and adjusts the golden circlet which has been knocked askew\nby her run. She then stops for a moment and looks at the photographs\non the dresser. One of her FATHER, her MOTHER and herself as a LITTLE\nGIRL. Another picture of her MOTHER in a newspaper clipping is taped\nto the mirror. The headline says, \"Linda Williams a Smash in New\nPlay.\" A cover of a Playbill is also tacked on to the mirror. It says\n_Best of Both Worlds_ starring Linda Williams. SARAH then reverently\nopens a music box -- the kind with a twirling dancer inside -- and to\nthe strains of an unbearably tinny version of \"Greensleeves\" she\nbegins to rehearse.\n\nSARAH: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my Lord\n...\n\nSuddenly, something stops her cold.\n\nSARAH (yelling angrily): Someone has been in my room!\n\nThrough the mirror WE SEE what she sees: an empty space on one of the\nshelves. She swirls around and rushes out the door.\n\n8\tINT: THE HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nSARAH bursts out of her room.\n\nSARAH: Where's Lancelot?\n\nShe stomps down the hallway.\n\nSARAH: Where's my bear?!!\n\n9\tINT: NURSERY - NIGHT\n\nSARAH enters FREDDIE's room. She searches the nursery.\n\nSARAH: Nobody listens to a thing I say.\n\nShe opens a toy box and rifles through it.\n\nSARAH: How many times have I told them to stay out of my room ...\n\nShe gets to the crib and looks down. FREDDIE is wide awake, gurgling\nat Lancelot, SARAH's tattered old teddy bear.\n\nSARAH: And you, you can just give me back my bear!\n\nShe yanks it out of the crib and leaves. FREDDIE looks hurt and his\nface starts to cloud up.\n\n10\tINT: SARAH 'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nSARAH is curled up on her bed, cuddling her bear. MERLIN sits beside\nher. She looks at the DOG.\n\nSARAH: You're the only one who understands me, Merlin.\n\nHe licks her face. She gets up and holds the bear out in front of her.\n\nSARAH: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my lord\n...\n\nShe is interrupted by FREDDIE's cries.\n\nSARAH: Go to sleep, Freddie!\n\nThe cries get louder. SARAH sighs and repeats her favorite litany.\n\nSARAH: Why does everything have to happen to me?\n\n11\tINT: NURSERY - NIGHT\n\nSARAH enters and approaches the howling INFANT.\n\nSARAH: I don't need this.\n\nShe pulls the blanket up over him and attempts to tuck him in.\n\nSARAH: There, isn't that nice ...\n\nBut FREDDIE doesn't think so. He pushes the blanket off and howls\neven louder. SARAH sees one of his toys on the floor and picks it up\nand gives it to him. She speaks through gritted teeth.\n\nSARAH: Want your nice toy?\n\nBut FREDDIE doesn't. He flings the toy across the room. SARAH bends\nover the crib and speaks softly.\n\nSARAH: You know, Freddie, I heard that the only thing to do with a\nbaby who won't stop crying is to get some goblins to come over and\nteach him a lesson ...\n\nFREDDIE lowers his screams to a whimper, but a loud whimper.\n\nSARAH: How would you like that, kid? A nasty evil goblin ...\n\nFREDDIE is quiet for a moment, almost as if he is considering. Then\nhe really howls. SARAH sighs and picks him up. She begins to pace\nback and forth, and starts to hum. FREDDIE goes back to a mere\nwhimper.\n\nSARAH: Oh, you like that, do you?\n\nShe begins to hum even louder and more melodically as she places the\nBABY back into the crib. She then begins one of the moat macabre\nlullabies you could ever imagine. She sings of how scary the dark is,\nhow \"the shadows on the wall like to eat you when you're small\" and\nhow \"a baby doesn't stand a chance when the Goblins start their\ndance.\" She throws herself into her performance; adding to it a wild\ndance that has her whirling around the room, leaping into the air,\nmaking strange shadows on the wall. Finally, the dance ends when too\nmany crazed pirouettes result in her stumbling against FREDDIE's\ndresser. She staggers a bit and then the lights blink as a crack of\nthunder is heard, followed by a flash of lightning.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nLittle FREDDIE is wailing. He hasn't understood a thing that SARAH\nhas sung but he can sense that something is wrong.\n\nSARAH: Ah, c'mon, Freddie. It was just a song.\n\nThey are interrupted by the sound of the doorbell. SARAH reacts with\na gasp of surprise. FREDDIE, for some inexplicable reason, is\nsuddenly quiet.\n\n12\tINT: FOYER - NIGHT\n\nSARAH approaches the front door with some trepidation. She starts to\nopen it, then realizes what she is doing. She fastens the chain and\nonly then opens the door.\n\n13\tEXT: HOUSE - NIGHT\nSARAH'S POV\n\nThrough the door opening SARAH can see a very elegantly dressed,\nquite good-looking MAN of an indeterminate age. He has a worldly air,\nor is it other-worldly? Before he can speak a flash of lightning\nilluminates his face. He is a mesmerizing sight and SARAH can't help\nbut gawk.\n\nMAN: Excuse me, is this the home of Sarah Williams ... Sarah\nWilliams, the actress?\n\nSARAH's jaw drops.\n\nSARAH: That's me.\n\nMAN: Allow me to introduce myself ... (he holds out his hand) I'm\nRobin Zaker.\n\nSARAH squeals with delight.\n\nSARAH: You wrote the play!\n\nHe smiles.\n\nSARAH: Just a second.\n\n14\tINT: FOYER - NIGHT\n\nSARAH's hand hesitates over the chain for just a moment, and then she\nunfastens it and opens the door. ZAKAR enters and extends his hand.\n\nZAKAR: It is an honour, Miss Williams. I understand you make a\ndelightful Queen Meander.\n\nSARAH: Well, we've just started rehearsal, but how did you know?\n\nZAKAR: I was passing through this part of the country and heard that\nit was going to be done here. This is the first amateur production of\nthe play, which of course is delightful for me.\n\nSARAH: You know we were supposed to open tonight, but we got delayed.\nThe firemen had to use the hall.\n\nZAKAR: Yes, I know, that's why I wanted to stop by to see you.\n\nThey are interrupted by a particularly loud crash from upstairs. And\nthen FREDDIE begins to howl.\n\nSARAH: That's my brother ...\n\nThere is another crash and SARAH starts up the stairs.\n\nSARAH: I'll be right back!\n\nZAKAR watches her run up the stairs. He glances around and then walks\nright to the liquor cabinet and takes out a bottle.\n\n15\tINT: NURSERY - NIGHT\n\nFREDDIE in standing in his crib crying his eyes out. SARAH rushes in\nand sees that the storm has blown open the basement window and it is\ncrashing against the wall. She rushes to close it. FREDDIE's screams\nare piteous.\n\nSARAH: Oh, Freddie ...\n\nThere is more thunder, and then lightning flashes across the darkened\nroom.\n\nZAKAR (VO): Perhaps I can soothe him ...\n\nSARAH gasps and whirls around. ZAKAR is framed in the doorway. He has\na drink in his hand. SARAH holds the BABY close.\n\nSARAH: You shouldn't be up here!\n\nZAKAR (smoothly): I just wanted to help ...\n\nSARAH rushes by him, still clutching the BABY.\n\n16\tINT: HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nSARAH comes out of the nursery and hurries down the stairs. ZAKAR\nfollows. FREDDIE is still crying.\n\nSARAH: Maybe you'd better leave ...\n\nShe gets to the bottom of the stairs. FREDDIE whimpers. ZAKAR is\nmaking her very nervous.\n\nSARAH: ... I, uh, don't think I care to talk to you about the play.\n\nHe is right behind her, almost too close.\n\nZAKAR: Neither do I.\n\nSARAH is shocked and disturbed by this.\n\nSARAH: What!\n\nZAKAR reaches over and smoothes FREDDIE's hair.\n\nZAKAR: I'm more concerned about the baby, of course.\n\nSARAH pulls FREDDIE out of his reach.\n\nSARAH: Freddie's just fine.\n\nBut he isn't. He's still crying. ZAKAR reaches into his pocket and\npulls out a coin. Be runs it over his fingers right in front of\nFREDDIE's face. The BABY stops crying.\n\nZAKAR: There, isn't that better?\n\nSARAH (nervously): Uh, sure ... but you really have to leave ...\n\nZAKAR ignores her and heads into the living room.\n\nZAKAR: I'm not just a playwright, as you can see ... bring him in\nhere and I'll do some other tricks for him ...\n\nSARAH: No! You've got to ...\n\nBut he is already in the living room. She follows, still holding the\nBABY.\n\n17\tINT: LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nZAKAR is sitting on the sofa, looking very comfortable. SARAH stands\nin the doorway, not sure what to do. Reluctantly, she goes and sits\ndown across from him.\n\nZAKAR: Now watch this, Freddie ...\n\nHe reaches into his breast pocket and tugs on the handkerchief there.\nIt comes out followed by many others, all different colours. SARAH\nrolls her eyes. This is not that exciting a trick. FREDDIE isn't\nimpressed, either. In fact he starts to cry again.\n\nZAKAR: So you're going to be like that, are you, Freddie? Well, you\nknow what that means?\n\nHe leans across the table and SARAH pulls the BABY closer.\n\nZAKAR: It's time to call the goblins!\n\nSARAH: What?!!\n\nSARAH is surprised to hear this, to say the least. It echoes her\nsilly threat to FREDDIE earlier.\n\nZAKAR: Yes. That's what we do with bad babies ... we send for the\ngoblins!!\n\nAnd with that he reaches into yet another pocket and pulls out a\npoorly made, very silly-looking goblin hand puppet. SARAH laughs\nwith relief. ZAKAR, his hand in the puppet, talks in a high-pitched,\nunconvincing goblin voice.\n\nZAKAR: You like goblins, don't'cha, Freddie? (singsong) but I bet\nyour sister doesn't ...\n\nSARAH rolls her eyes at this, and then gasps. Because for one very\nstrange moment, the puppet keeps bouncing, but both of ZAKAR's hands\nare visible! And then the puppet seems to move away from the table,\nand disappear! FREDDIE claps his hands with delight. SARAH jumps out\nof her chair.\n\nSARAH: Where is it?!!!\n\nZAKAR points to a large cabinet against the wall.\n\nZAKAR: It's in there.\n\nSARAH: Impossible!\n\nZAKAR: See for yourself.\n\nSARAH hesitates for a moment, and then places FREDDIE carefully on\nthe rug. She then marches over to the cabinet and throws open the\ndoor.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nthe puppet, grinning wildly from inside the cabinet.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH gasps and involuntarily slams the door. She whirls around to\nface ZAKAR.\n\nSARAH: How did you do that?!!\n\nZAKAR leans back into the sofa.\n\nZAKAR: Magic.\n\nSARAH: Oh sure ...\n\nShe nods, skeptically. She can't see -- but WE CAN DEFINITELY SEE --\nthe cabinet door slowly open behind her, and out of it comes a tiny,\nfierce-looking GOBLIN! This is not a puppet, but a living creature\nthat moves quickly out of sight with an exaggerated tiptoe. SARAH is\nbusy with another problem. She doesn't see FREDDIE!\n\nSARAH: Where's Freddie?!!\n\nZAKAR shrugs. In a panic, SARAH begins to look around this room. She\ncalls for FREDDIE and, as she passes in front of the living room\ndoorway, WE CAN SEE something scurry across the hallway. SARAH stops\nand listens.\n\nSARAH: Freddie?\n\nBut it wasn't a BABY she heard. Behind her there is more scurrying as\nCREATURES begin to appear from various parts of the room. We hear\nfaint snickering. She turns to ZAKAR, terrified.\n\nSARAH: Where is he?!!\n\nZAKAR points to the chair SARAH was sitting in. She is behind the\nchair and can't see anything. But when she comes around in front of\nit she sees FREDDIE comfortably ensconced in the cushions. And he's\nplaying with the goblin puppet! SARAH reaches over and grabs the\npuppet out of his hands. She flings it across the room and scoops up\nthe BABY.\n\nSARAH: Who are you?!!!\n\nZAKAR throws back his head and laughs, then suddenly leaps off the\nsofa and lands very close to her.\n\nZAKAR: I've been known by many names ... but the one I prefer is\n_Jareth, King of the Goblins_!!!\n\nSARAH holds FREDDIE close and backs away.\n\nSARAH: I don't believe this!\n\nAmidst thunder and lightning JARETH flings his arms up into the air,\nand he is suddenly dressed in strange, medieval garb, a cloak\nswirling around him. And what's worse, much, much worse, is that\nsuddenly GOBLINS are everywhere! Popping out of drawers, from under\nchairs, swinging off the chandeliers. SARAH turns and runs out of the\nroom.\n\n18\tINT: FOYER - NIGHT\n\nIt's worse in here! The GOBLINS are pouring down the stairs, SOME\nslide down the bannister! SARAH tries running into another room, but\nis soon back, followed by a DOZEN MORE! She barely makes it to the\nfront door and struggles to open it with the BABY in her arms. The\nGOBLINS pull her back and laugh wildly. They fling her right into\nJARETH's arms. He scoops FREDDIE up and whirls away from her. SARAH\ntries to grab the BABY back but the GOBLINS get between them.\n\nSARAH (hysterical): Give him back, you monster! Give him back!\n\nJARETH only laughs and starts to swirl gracefully. FREDDIE laughs\nwith delight and SARAH struggles to reach him. With a superhuman\neffort she pushes through the MASS OF CREATURES and grabs onto\nJARETH's fluttering cloak. It's like being caught up in a whirlwind\nof incredible force.\n\nSARAH (screaming): I ... won't ... let ... you ... take ... him!\n\nBut it's too late. SARAH's feet leave the ground and she is pulled\nwith them and the whole MASS OF GOBLINS. JARETH and FREDDIE swirl up\nthrough where the ceiling would have been, up into the blackness.\nThere's a QUICK MONTAGE OF SHOTS: JARETH's laughing face; SARAH,\ndesperate as her fingers are losing their grip; FREDDIE, who's having\na great time; GOBLINS, ALL gleeful; then -- JARETH's garment pulls\nout of SARAH's grip. She falls OUT OF FRAME, a silent scream on her\nface.\n\n19\tEXT: LABYRINTH - DAY\nA WIDE PEACEFUL SHOT\n\nThe sky is pink, and the WHITE BIRD swoops by us as WE TILT DOWN TO\nSEE the exterior wall of the labyrinth. It is a high masonry wall\nthat extends off in either direction. Along the wall are various\nornamental bushes and there is a small figure of a dwarf, his back to\nus, peeing into a tiny pond. It looks for all the world like one of\nthose ornamental garden sculptures. But it isn't. This is HOGGLE. In\na CLOSER SHOT, which is quite discreet, HOGGLE finishes peeing, and\ngoes over to a particularly lush shrub. A few butterfly-like\ncreatures, flower fairies, flit around the bushes.\n\nHOGGLE: An' how's me pride an' joy!\n\nHe leans forward to sniff one of the magnificent blossoms, sighing\nwith pleasure as he does. But before he can indulge he is stopped by\nthe whistling sound of a falling object. SARAH falls from the sky and\nlands right on his prize shrub! Incensed, he screams with fury.\n\nHOGGLE: What is this? Look what you done! You murderer!\n\nSARAH struggles out of the broken shrub.\n\nSARAH: What are you saying, you horrible little man?!\n\nHOGGLE: I ain't horrible, I'm _Hoggle_. And just look! You've\ndestroyed me prize blossoms!\n\nHe realizes the extent of the damage to his prize specimen.\n\nHOGGLE: I'll get ya for it, you big oaf!\n\nAnd he picks up a spray can and goes after SARAH. But she's had\nenough. After the nightmarish kidnapping of FREDDIE and a drop from\nthe deepest space, this guy is child's play. She reaches out and\npulls the can from HOGGLE's hands. She then grabs him by the\nshirt-front and practically lifts him off the ground.\n\nSARAH: Oh no you don't! If anyone's getting anything around here,\nit's me ... now where' my brother?!!\n\nHOGGLE: I ain't sayin' nothin' 'til ye let me go!\n\nSARAH sighs and lets go.\n\nSARAH: I'm sorry. But this just hasn't been my day.\n\nHOGGLE looks at his crushed shrub again.\n\nHOGGLE: Ye ain't the only one.\n\nSARAH ignores him and stares at the massive wall behind them.\n\nSARAH: And I don't understand any of this!\n\nHOGGLE shakes his head and sighs.\n\nHOGGLE: Now where have I heard that before.\n\nSARAH: What do you mean?\n\nHOGGLE: I mean, everyone who comes here thinkin' they can make it\nthrough the labyrinth says sumthin' like (mimicking Sarah in a whiny,\nhigh pitch) ... I don't understand this, whatever am I doing here,\nhow will I ever get home ...\n\nSARAH: What makes you think I'm here to get through a labyrinth?\n\nHOGGLE shakes his head again.\n\nHOGGLE: Can't think of any reason why you'd be standin' here in front\no' this gate if you weren't.\n\nSARAH doesn't understand what he is talking about but when she looks\nup she can't believe her eyes.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nA huge gate where just a moment ago there nothing but smooth, endless\nwall. SARAH gulps in disbelief. Then the huge wooden doors fly open\nand a terrified CREATURE runs out, full speed, screaming for his\nlife. Right behind him come TWO MENACING GOBLINS riding on strange\nBEASTS. They are armed and dangerous looking. They quickly catch up\nwith the CREATURE and drag him, screaming piteously, back through the\ngate. Before the gates close SARAH can see MORE GOBLINS, what seems\nlike hundreds of them. SOME are mounted, MOST of them are armed. And\nbeyond them a walled passageway seems to go on forever. Then the\nwooden doors slam shut.\n\nSARAH: Oh, no! Not more goblins!\n\nHOGGLE: That's Jareth's goblin army, and that other poor fool musta\nbeen caught meanderin' where he had no business.\n\nSARAH: What will they do to him?\n\nHOGGLE: I don't like to think about things like that.\n\nSARAH shudders.\n\nSARAH: I wonder if things can get any worse?\n\nHOGGLE sighs knowingly.\n\nHOGGLE: He's taken sumthin' o' yours, ain't he?\n\nSARAH is clearly surprised.\n\nHOGGLE: Jareth, our high an' mighty king ...\n\nSARAH nods, excited that someone has a grasp of the situation.\n\nHOGGLE: Bet he's gone and taken sumthin' you love.\n\nSARAH (shrugging): Close. He's got my baby brother.\n\nHOGGLE laughs derisively.\n\nHOGGLE: Baby snatchin'! That's low.\n\nSARAH: So I've just got to do something!\n\nHOGGLE: Like what?\n\nSARAH: Get Freddie back, of course!\n\nHOGGLE: Then ya'd have ta make it through the labyrinth, 'cause\nJareth's castle is at its very center.\n\nSARAH looks at the gates and gulps.\n\nSARAH: Is it difficult?\n\nHOGGLE snorts with derision.\n\nHOGGLE: Is me prize shrub crushed into oblivion?\n\nSARAH is reaching the breaking point.\n\nSARAH: Look, I'm sorry about your bush! But it's not like I asked to\nhave some weirdo come and take my baby brother and then drop me out\nof the sky!\n\nHOGGLE: Well, I didn't ask for some overgrown flower fairy to drop on\nme prized possession, neither!\n\nSARAH: Oh, this is ridiculous!\n\nAnd she stalks off to the gate, mumbling all the way.\n\nSARAH (to herself): ... standing here wasting time talking to some\nweird guy who should be living under a bridge ...\n\nShe is almost at the gate when she freezes with fear. Through the\ngate she can hear the cheers and jeers of the GOBLINS, and what might\nbe the wailing of their poor CAPTIVE. There's no way she wants to\nrisk facing that horrific CREW. HOGGLE has come up behind her and as\nshe backs away from the gate she bumps into him. She shrieks and\nwhirls around.\n\nHOGGLE: That ain't the only way in, ya know!\n\nSARAH is very relieved to hear this.\n\nSARAH: It's not?!\n\nHOGGLE: Course it ain't. There's many a route in ... just only one\nway out.\n\nSARAH: Well show me one! I've got to find my brother!\n\nHOGGLE sighs impatiently. Be fingers a belt that he wears, rattling\nit in an obvious manner. It in hung with every kind of watch and\nbracelet and ring you can imagine.\n\nHOGGLE: Information like that has a price ...\n\nSARAH, taken aback by the amount of loot he's acquired.\n\nSARAH: I could give you this ...\n\nShe takes the gold circlet off her head. HOGGLE isn't interested.\n\nHOGGLE: I had sumthin' o' this caliber in mind ...\n\nHe takes her hand and WE SEE that she is wearing a beautiful ruby\nring. SARAH shakes her head vehemently.\n\nSARAH: No. My mother gave me that.\n\nHOGGLE eyes it greedily.\n\nHOGGLE: She could give ya another ...\n\nSARAH: No, she couldn't. (sadness crosses her face suddenly) She\nlives real far away ...\n\nThe sadness disappears just as suddenly. She holds out the circlet.\n\nSARAH: This is all you get.\n\nHe grabs the circlet and bites it.\n\nHOGGLE: Bah! It's paste!\n\nSomething catches SARAH's eye. It is one of the tiny FLOWER FAIRIES.\nShe leans over for a better look.\n\nSARAH: No it's not, it's plastic.\n\nHOGGLE's eyes light up at that and he grunts with satisfaction as he\nstrings the circlet onto his belt. SARAH reaches out her hand to the\nFAIRY.\n\nSARAH: What a beautiful little thing ...\n\nHOGGLE reaches for the spray can.\n\nHOGGLE: Let me at it!\n\nSARAH is enraged.\n\nSARAH: You murderer! How can you kill such beautiful creatures?!!\n\nJust then the FAIRY gives SARAH a vicious bite. She shakes it off her\nhand and cries out in pain.\n\nSARAH: It bit me!\n\nHOGGLE quickly sprays the offending FAIRY and it falls to the earth,\nscreaming all the way.\n\nHOGGLE: Of course it bit ya! There's nuthin' more vicious than a\nflower fairy. Any fool knows that!\n\nSARAH sucks on her wounded hand and tries not to cry.\n\nHOGGLE (sighs): But you don't know nuthin', do ya?\n\nA tear trickles down SARAH's cheek. HOGGLE sighs.\n\nHOGGLE: I got a feelin' I'm gonna regret this. (he stalks off) Come\nwith me an' I'll show ya a way in.\n\nSARAH hurries after him. As they walk along the endless wall HOGGLE\nlooks at the circlet and polishes it on his sleeve.\n\nHOGGLE (thrilled): Plastic!\n\n20\tEXT: LABYRINTH - DAY\n\nAnother part of the wall. HOGGLE pushes a bush aside and shows SARAH\na tiny door. She looks at it dubiously.\n\nHOGGLE: This'll take ya into the maze, that's the first part of the\nlabyrinth ...\n\nSARAH: The first part! What comes after that?\n\nHOGGLE gets down on his knees and starts to crawl through the door.\n\nHOGGLE: Then there's the Garden Maze, then the Forbidden Forest ...\n\nSARAH: That sounds inviting ...\n\nHe is through the door. He is still talking but SARAH can't hear him.\nShe quickly tries to follow.\n\nSARAH: Wait! Wait! I can't hear you ...\n\n21\tINT: LABYRINTH - DAY\n\nHOGGLE is through the door.\n\nHOGGLE: ... then comes the castle ...\n\nSARAH's head appears.\n\nHOGGLE: ... that's surely where Jareth's keepin' the babe ...\n\nHe looks down at SARAH, she is through the door to her waist and\nstraining to get the rest of herself through. HOGGLE sighs and grabs\nher hand. With a groan he tugs on her and pulls her through the\ndoorway. She lands flat on her face.\n\nHOGGLE: Ya don't seem ta be able ta do nuthin' without my help, do ya?\n\nHe chuckles and SARAH gives him a look that could kill as she gets up\nand dusts herself off. She looks around and the environment seems\nrather benign. The brick walls are open to the sky, here and there a\nflower peeks through a crack.\n\nSARAH: Oh, I think I can handle it. In fact, this place doesn't seem\nso bad at all.\n\nAnd with that, she jauntily heads down the nearest corridor.\n\n22\tINT: CORRIDOR 1 - DAY\n\nSARAH turns a corner and comes face to face with a FACE. It is huge\nand grotesque and protrudes out of the wall.\n\nFACE: Go back! Go back before it's too late!\n\nSARAH screams and backs away from it, moving further down the\ncorridor. She backs into something and whirls around. It is ANOTHER\nFACE.\n\nFACE 2: Turn back while you still can!!\n\nSARAH turns and runs back the way she came.\n\nSARAH: Hoggle!\n\n23\tINT: LABYRINTH - DAY\n\nHOGGLE is still standing by the door, an amused smile on his face.\nSARAH comes rushing toward him.\n\nSARAH: Oh, I'm so glad you're still here! They were horrible ...\n\nHOGGLE: You don't mean the False Alarms, do ya?\n\nHe shakes his head and goes off in the direction that SARAH just came\nfrom.\n\nHOGGLE: If ya gonna let a little thing like them scare ya, Missy, ya\nhaven't a hope o' makin' it to the castle.\n\nSARAH quickly follows.\n\nSARAH: False Alarms?\n\n24\tINT: CORRIDOR 1 - DAY\n\nThe corridor of faces. HOGGLE enters and the FACES start in on their\nroutine. SARAH comes up behind him, shuddering at the ghastly sight.\n\nFACE 1: This is the path of no return!\n\nFACE 2: Beware! Beware!\n\nHOGGLE: Just ignore 'em.\n\nSARAH: Are you sure?\n\nHOGGLE sighs and turns to the NEXT FACE.\n\nFACE 3: Abandon all hope ...\n\nHOGGLE: Oh, shut up, will ya?\n\nSARAH is wide-eyed at HOGGLE's defiance.\n\nFACE 3: But I was just getting to the best part!\n\nHOGGLE: All right. But don't expect us to pay any attention.\n\nFACE 3 (winks at Sarah): You're going to love this ... Abandon all\nhope ye who enter here, for this is the road to destruction!!!\n\nHOGGLE (bored): Very nice ...\n\nSARAH is dumbstruck. HOGGLE takes her hand and yanks her along.\n\nFACE 3: Come back any time ... I mean, you're doomed, doomed!\n\n25\tINT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAY\n\nHOGGLE and SARAH continuing down a similar corridor.\n\nHOGGLE: Ya see, things aren't always what they appear to be around\nhere, Missy ...\n\nSARAH (shrugging): Whatever. All I'm interested in is getting my\nbrother back from that creep.\n\nShe starts to look around for something.\n\nHOGGLE: I admire yer determination, but it takes more'n that to beat\nJareth.\n\nSARAH picks up a rock.\n\nSARAH: Well, maybe I'm beginning to get the hang of this labyrinth\nbusiness.\n\nShe takes the rock and uses it to mark an X on the floor.\n\nSARAH: See, now I'll know which way we came in case I get lost.\n\nHOGGLE (sighs): Missy, goin' back the way ya came is par fer the\ncourse around here, what ya want to do is go forward.\n\nSARAH: Look, Hoggle! I've got to find Freddie and I don't need you to\ndiscourage me!\n\nHOGGLE: And I don't need to be wastin' me time goin' around in\ncircles with you!\n\nSARAH: That's fine with me! (she starts off) I know you're only after\nmy ring, anyway!\n\nShe turns a corner and HOGGLE looks after her, hurt and pity crossing\nhis face. He takes a few steps in her direction and an officious\nlittle creature, a BRICKKEEPER, emerges from the brickwork of the\nfloor, takes out the cobblestone that SARAH marked, and replaces it\nwith the marked side hidden. It looks up at HOGGLE.\n\nBRICKKEEPER: Some people got no respect for property!\n\nHOGGLE sticks his tongue out at the CREATURE just as it goes back\ninto its hole.\n\n26\tEXT: AERIAL SHOT - DAY\n\nThe WHITE BIRD flies over the maze and WE SEE SARAH marching along.\nShe thinks she's going forward but she's heading right for HOGGLE.\n\n27\tINT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAY\n\nSARAH emerges into the corridor and comes face to face with HOGGLE.\n\nSARAH: But ...\n\nShe whirls around to look behind her, then back at HOGGLE again.\n\nSARAH: ... but you were just behind me! I'm sure of it!\n\nHOGGLE shakes his head as she runs by him and looks down at the floor.\n\nSARAH: My mark! It was right here!\n\nHOGGLE comes up beside her.\n\nHOGGLE: I told ya, Missy. Things aren't what they appear to be around\nhere ...\n\nJARETH (VO): Except when they are.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nJARETH, in all his glory. SARAH and HOGGLE whirl around and BOTH gasp\nwith surprise and fear.\n\nJARETH: We meet again ... Sarah.\n\nSARAH: Where's Freddie?!! What have you done with him!?\n\nShe starts to rush toward JARETH but HOGGLE holds her back.\n\nJARETH: Nothing ... yet.\n\nHe walks toward them and they automatically step backwards. He looks\ndown at HOGGLE.\n\nJARETH: And what have we here ... Hoghead, isn't it?\n\nHOGGLE is humiliated.\n\nHOGGLE: Me name's Hoggle.\n\nJARETH: Ah, yes. Now I remember. (he moves closer to Hoggle) You're\nthe greedy little coward who lives outside the gate. Shouldn't you be\nback there minding your own business ... Hedgehog?\n\nHe chucks HOGGLE under the chin, and is quite rough about it. HOGGLE\nfumes silently. SARAH doesn't like this.\n\nSARAH: Why, why don't you pick on someone your own size?\n\nHe looks her up and down.\n\nJARETH: Whom did you have in mind?\n\nSARAH tries to brazen it out.\n\nSARAH: I don't have time for any games. I want Freddie, and I want\nhim now!\n\nJARETH throws back his head and laughs.\n\nJARETH: Ah, Freddie. An adorable little imp. I'm really growing\nrather fond of him.\n\nSARAH: Where is he?!!\n\nJARETH: He's in my castle, and seems to be enjoying himself immensely.\n\nHe ambles toward them and they can't help themselves, they BOTH step\nbackwards.\n\nJARETH: In fact, he likes being with goblins so much, I'm considering\nturning him into one.\n\nSARAH thinks this is crazy.\n\nSARAH: You can't do that!\n\nJARETH (grinning): Oh yes I can.\n\nSARAH looks down at HOGGLE and speaks under her breath.\n\nSARAH: Can he?\n\nHOGGLE nods glumly.\n\nJARETH: But let's make it interesting. I won't do it for ... thirteen\nhours. If you make it to the castle before then you might be able to\nsave him. If not, well, I think little Freddie will mike an adorable\ngoblin prince, don't you?\n\nHe laughs and holds up both hands and WE SEE that they are empty. He\nthen closes them and when he opens them again there is a gold watch\nin one hand. He throws it to SARAH, but HOGGLE intercepts it and eyes\nit greedily. Annoyed, SARAH snatches it out of his hand. She looks at\nit and sees that it has 13 hours marked on it. When she looks up\nagain, JARETH is gone.\n\nWORM (VO): Well, good riddance to bad rubbish!\n\nSARAH and HOGGLE BOTH jump and then look at where the voice is coming\nfrom. It is a little WORM, poking its head out of a hole in the\nbrickwork.\n\nWORM: That's what the missus always says, she does. Why the last time\nshe found that one around here she sent him packing.\n\nSARAH: Jareth?!\n\nWORM: She don't take to his kind of nonsense, that's for sure. Now,\nhow about a nice cup of tea? The missus has a kettle on.\n\nSARAH looks down at HOGGLE, who shrugs. She then looks up at the WORM\nand gives him a beaming smile.\n\n28\tINT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAY\n\nSARAH and HOGGLE are sitting on the floor.\n\nSARAH: Do you think Jareth will give Freddie back if I make it on\ntime?\n\nHOGGLE: It's hard to say, Missy. But if I were you, I'd worry 'bout\nfirst things first.\n\nSARAH: What do you mean?\n\nHOGGLE: I means ya got ta find the castle before ya can go savin' the\nbabe and I mean ta see that ya do!\n\nSARAH is thrilled and leans over and gives him a kiss on the cheek.\n\nSARAH: Oh, Hoggle! Thank you, thank you so much!\n\nHOGGLE gets all flustered and tries to act gruff.\n\nHOGGLE: Seems to me I could be gettin' that ring from ya after all if\nI plays me cards right.\n\nSARAH regards him affectionately.\n\nSARAH: I know you don't mean that. You're helping me because you're\nreally nice.\n\nHOGGLE: I ain't nice! I just likes the way ya stood up ta him is all.\n(he is thoughtful for a moment; almost to himself) Too bad more've us\nhaven't had the guts to do the same.\n\nThe WORM reappears.\n\nWORM: How about a biscuit? The missus just took a fresh batch out of\nthe oven.\n\nSARAH: Thanks, but we really don't have any time. We've got to get to\nthe castle.\n\nHOGGLE: Ya wouldn't happen to know a shortcut, would ya?\n\nWORM: Well, you might try taking that first left.\n\nSARAH and HOGGLE look down the corridor.\n\nSARAH: But there isn't any left turn.\n\nJust then a strange FIGURE seems to come through the left wall and\nwalks toward them. He is dressed in long flowing robes and wears a\nhat shaped like a bird.\n\nWORM: See, there's a left turn right there, where that Wise One just\ncame in.\n\nSARAH: A Wise One! Maybe he knows the best way to the castle!\n\nHOGGLE: I wouldn't bet on it.\n\nBut SARAH is excited about the possibility of getting more help.\n\nSARAH: Excuse me, Sir. Could you tell us the best way to get to the\ncastle?\n\nWISE ONE: The best way to the castle, hmmm. I'm glad you asked that\nquestion.\n\nTo SARAH's and HOGGLE's surprise, the HAT joins into the conversation.\n\nHAT: Now you've done it, gone and asked him a question. We'll be here\nall day!\n\nWISE ONE: A castle, or fortress, or as it is sometimes known, a\nstronghold or citadel -- or, that which has a turret and barbican,\nbut usually not a portcullis ...\n\nHAT: What did I tell you? There's no stopping him now.\n\nWISE ONE: ... often there is a rampart or bulwark, and then a parapet\n-- perchance an actual vallum or counterscarp ...\n\nHAT: Shut up down there!\n\nWISE ONE: ... and for entrenchment; a moat, drawbridge and sally-port\n...\n\nSARAH looks at HOGGLE.\n\nSARAH: This was not one of my better ideas.\n\nHAT: Well, I told you that, didn't I? But nobody ever listens to me!\n\nHe looks down at the still mumbling WISE ONE.\n\nHAT: Enough! Nobody cares!!\n\nThe WISE ONE blinks and looks at SARAH and HOGGLE.\n\nWISE ONE: Did one of you say something?\n\nSARAH thinks quickly.\n\nSARAH: Oh, no. We never talk to strangers.\n\nWISE ONE: That's very wise. An idea worth savoring.\n\nHOGGLE nudges him.\n\nHOGGLE: Yeah, but keep it under your hat!\n\nHOGGLE thinks this is hilarious. The HAT doesn't.\n\nHAT: Ve-ry funny!\n\nThe WISE ONE continues on his way.\n\nWISE ONE: The stranger, hmm. I'm glad you brought that up. The\nstranger; one not indigenous, also known as the alien, or one from\nbeyond the sea ...\n\nHAT (hysterical): I quit! I can't take it anymore!\n\nAnd then they are gone, passing through the righthand wall as if it\nwasn't there. SARAH watches after them, stunned.\n\nSARAH: How did he do that?!!\n\nHOGGLE: And how can we make sure he doesn't come back?\n\nSARAH gives him a look and turns to the WORM.\n\nWORM: Just go over to that bit of wall there and walk right through\nit. The important thing is to forget what you think you know. It\ndoesn't apply around here.\n\nSARAH and HOGGLE walk down to the part of the wall where the WISE ONE\nentered. Once there, they can see that a section of the wall is\nactually a passageway-width behind the rest of the wall. SARAH yells\nback to the WORM.\n\nSARAH: Thank you! And tell the missus we're sorry we missed her\nbiscuits!\n\nAnd then they walk through the wall and are gone.\n\n29\tINT: CORRIDOR 3 - DAY\n\nSARAH and HOGGLE appear through the wall and SARAH laughs with\ndelight. HOGGLE wasn't as pleased with the experience and feels the\nwall as if testing to see if it really happened. SARAH sees that they\nare in a corridor where the walls are crumbling and she climbs up to\nthe top of one and looks over.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH'S POV - THE TURRETS OF THE CASTLE\n\nSARAH (excited): I can see the castle! It doesn't look far at all!\n\nHOGGLE is still feeling around the wall, trying to figure out how\nthey got there. SARAH jumps down and starts to run down the corridor.\n\nSARAH: Come on, Hoggle. Let's go!\n\nHOGGLE sees her retreating figure and hurries after her.\n\n30\tINT: CASTLE - DAY\n\nJARETH's great hall. He stands by a window and looks out over the\nlabyrinth -- from this vantage point he can see clear across it: the\nhovels that surround the castle walls, the arid plain that leads to\nthe dense forest, encircling that, the complex maze. He seems lost in\nthought. The WHITE BIRD enters the window and lands on his shoulder.\nBehind him FREDDIE is having a grand time. His slippery crawl is too\nmuch for the GOBLINS that scurry about, trying to mind him.\nMeanwhile, a particularly stupid looking GOBLIN begins to approach\nJARETH. He saunters across the room and is stopped short by a FEMALE\nGOBLIN. She grabs hold of his shirt and hisses a warning.\n\nFEMALE GOBLIN: Remember! It's bow and scrape ... bow and scrape ...\n\nThe STUPID GOBLIN nods and she lets him go. He then continues his\napproach to JARETH, only this time he does a little bow and then\nscrapes his foot across the floor, then repeats the action.\n\nSTUPID GOBLIN (to himself): Bow 'n scrape ... bow 'n scrape ...\n\nJARETH turns and sees the GOBLIN.\n\nJARETH: Well, what is it?\n\nThe GOBLIN can't answer and do his bow-and-scrape at the same time so\ncontinues his painfully slow approach.\n\nSTUPID GOBLIN: ... bow 'n scrape ... bow 'n scrape ...\n\nAnnoyed, JARETH walks over to the GOBLIN and lifts him up by his\nshirt front. The GOBLIN is still bowing.\n\nJARETH: I said, what is it?!!!\n\nSTUPID GOBLIN: Th ... the girl and Hoggle, sire. Th ... they're\nhalfway th .... through th ... the maze.\n\nJARETH drops the GOBLIN hard on the floor. FREDDIE sees this and\nlaughs with delight. JARETH walks over and scoops the BABY up in his\narms. He then carries him over to the window. He calls over to an\nARMED GOBLIN by the door.\n\nJARETH: I think it's time they had some company.\n\nARMED GOBLIN: Yes, Sir!\n\nBe then salutes, causing his visor to close on his face, then\nstumbles around looking for the door. JARETH shakes his head.\n\nJARETH: You'll make a much better goblin than that, won't you,\nFreddie!\n\nFREDDIE's response is to clap his sticky baby's hand on to JARETH's\nface. JARETH, pretending he doesn't mind, carefully removes it. He\nthen looks down to the courtyard below.\n\n31\tEXT: CASTLE - DAY\nJARETH'S POV\n\nARMED GOBLINS are pouring out of the castle.\n\n32\tEXT: CORRIDOR 4 - DAY\n\nSARAH and HOGGLE are striding down a corridor. They are about to come\nto a corner.\n\nSARAH: Are you sure Jareth can turn Freddie into a goblin? I mean,\nthat's really weird ...\n\nThey turn the corner and HOGGLE stops short. SARAH becomes alarmed.\n\nSARAH: What is it?\n\nHOGGLE gestures for her to be quiet and then we can hear what he\nhears -- marching. They look back the way they came.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH'S AND HOGGLE'S POV - A BATTALION OF ARMED GOBLINS, marching\nright towards them!\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nThey look at each other, then turn and run. HOGGLE tries to get\nthrough the wall the way the WORM showed them.\n\nHOGGLE (quoting the worm): Just forget what you think you know and ...\n\nHe smacks headlong into the wall. He stops to rub his nose and SARAH\nflies by him.\n\nSARAH: Come on!\n\n33\tINT: CASTLE - DAY\n\nFREDDIE is now sitting on the lap of a GOBLIN, happily bopping it on\nthe nose. JARETH snaps his fingers and a GROUP of sleepy MUSICIANS in\nthe corner stumble over themselves to pick up their instruments. They\nbegin to play and JARETH looks out the window and begins a song. He\nsings about the labyrinth; what it is -- his domain, and what it is\nto OTHERS -- a test, a proving-ground, not for the faint of heart.\n\n34\tINT: MAZE MONTAGE - DAY\n\nWhile JARETH sings, SARAH and HOGGLE try to escape from the GOBLINS.\nThey get a lead on them for a while and come to another corridor with\ncrumbling walls. They scamper up to get a look at their position and\nsee dust rising from several parts of the maze. The GOBLINS are\neverywhere.\n\nIn another corridor, they are stopped in their tracks by DOZENS OF\nLITTLE FUZZY CREATURES who scurry towards them out of the way of the\noncoming GOBLINS. They turn and run back the way they came and as\nthey do WALL CREATURES chatter nervously and then disappear into the\ncracks between the bricks.\n\nIn a corridor with very short walls they are able to see the tips of\nspears on either side of them, going in the opposite direction.\n\nThey enter a corridor with several arches curving over it, forming\nsmall, intermittent bridges. Thinking they are safe, they stop for a\nbreath, and soon realize that a BATTALION is right behind them. They\nscurry up the walls, and as the song comes to an end, they each lie\nacross an arch hopefully out of sight of the GOBLINS below.\n\n35\tINT: ARCHED CORRIDOR - DAY\n\nSARAH and HOGGLE huddle above the corridor on their arches as TWO\nGOBLINS bring up the rear.\n\nGOBLIN 1: I can kill better than you can.\n\nGOBLIN 2: But I'm better at maiming. Everybody says so.\n\nAnd they are gone. Shaken, SARAH and HOGGLE slide down from their\nhiding places.\n\nSARAH: Do you think they're gone?\n\nHOGGLE: Sure they are. Goblins ain't known fer their intelligence, ya\nknow. They has as much trouble findin' their way through the maze as\nyou do.\n\nHe folds his arms and leans against the wall.\n\nSARAH: I'm not sure, but I think you just called me stupid ...\n\nSuddenly HOGGLE yells and disappears. He has accidentally leaned on\nanother secret wall opening. SARAH quickly follows.\n\n36\tINT: CORRIDOR 5 - DAY\n\nHOGGLE and SARAH are now in the long circular corridor that divides\nthe maze from the beginning of the second ring of the labyrinth --\nthe Garden Maze.\n\nHOGGLE (excited): I think I know where we are!\n\nSARAH: That'll be a nice change.\n\nHe ignores her and looks around excitedly.\n\nHOGGLE: This place is the end o' the maze! That means we're near the\nentrance ta the second ring o' the labyrinth.\n\nSARAH: The second ring? What's that?\n\nHOGGLE starts down the corridor.\n\nHOGGLE (happily): The Garden Maze!\n\nSARAH (gloomy): Sounds like a great place ... what's it like?\n\nHOGGLE: Don't know, I ain't never made it this far before.\n\nHe is skipping happily down the corridor when SARAH hears something.\nIt is a strange clanking sound.\n\nSARAH (frightened): Hoggle! What's that sound?!!\n\nHOGGLE stops skipping and sighs.\n\nHOGGLE: Now don't go gettin' all girly on me, Missy, now that we's\nfinally safe ...\n\nSARAH: So you think we're safe, do you?\n\nHOGGLE (annoyed): Didn't I just say so?!!\n\nSARAH: Then tell me what you think of that.\n\nSARAH points behind them where the clanking noise is coming from. It\nis now much louder. HOGGLE comes over to her and takes a better look.\nHe screams.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nTHEIR POV - A SLASHING MACHINE is coming right towards them. (A\nslashing wall is made up of rows of furiously spinning knives, and\nchopping cleavers, and has brushes along the bottom to clean up\nwhatever it encounters in its path.) And there is no way around it\nbecause it completely fills the corridor.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nHOGGLE desperately tries to walk through the wall the way they came\nin, but it is to no avail. He just keeps smashing his face. SARAH\nstarts to run for it.\n\nSARAH: Come on!\n\nHOGGLE follows, every so often trying, and failing, to get through\nthe wall.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH, who is far ahead of HOGGLE, comes to a door! And hanging on a\nhook next to it is a bunch of keys. She looks back at HOGGLE.\n\nSARAH: Hoggle, hurry!\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH'S POV - HOGGLE running toward her, and making slow but steady\nprogress toward them BOTH -- the slashing machine.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH fumbles with the keys, furiously trying key after key in the\ndoor but to no avail. She is terrified.\n\nSARAH: None of the keys work!\n\nDesperate, she starts banging on the door. HOGGLE is just a few yards\naway from her.\n\nHOGGLE: Why don't you just try it?\n\nHe then tries once more to walk through the wall. SARAH tries the\nknob and sure enough, it opens. She is delighted. What she doesn't\nsee is HOGGLE suddenly disappearing through the floor.\n\nSARAH: It's open! Hog ...\n\nShe turns around and he is gone! And the slashing machine is just a\nfew yards away! She screams and, in her terror, falls backwards\nthrough the door. It slams shut just as the slashing machine reaches\nit WE CAN SEE that FOUR GOBLINS in sanitation workers' uniforms have\nbeen pushing the machine all along. They grunt and strain, cranking\nthe wheels that turn the knives and pushing all at the same time.\n\n37\tINT: PICTURE GALLERY - DAY\n\nSARAH emerges into a large room. The walls are covered with large\npaintings in ornate gilt frames. She is a bit stunned by the clone\ncall with the slashing machine as she approaches the first painting.\n\nSARAH (to herself): What in the world ...\n\nShe stops short in front of the first painting and cannot believe her\neyes. It is a painting of the watch with 13 hours on it. The hour\nhand is on the 9. SARAH fumbles into her pocket and finds the watch\nthat Jareth gave her. It also has the hour hand on the 9.\n\nSARAH: Only 9 hours left!\n\nThe next picture is of a BABY surrounded by gruesome GOBLINS. On\ncloser inspection, the BABY is obviously FREDDIE. She chokes back a\nsob and runs over to the next one, it is a picture of a rotunda with\nstaircases going off in all different directions on different planes\nof gravity. It is an Escher room, and a closer look shows a GOBLIN\nhappily standing on the ceiling. She shakes her head and goes by the\nnext painting and gasps involuntarily. It is a compelling portrait of\nJARETH, and she moves even closer. Then she shakes herself out of it.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nTHE PORTRAIT'S POV - SARAH wills herself away and moves on, and we\nhear the sound of JARETH's breathing.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH is nervous and eagerly looks for a way out. She rushes by\nanother painting, giving it merely a glance. But something makes her\ngo back for a better look. It is of a lovely, manicured hedge maze.\nIn the distance WE CAN SEE the turrets of JARETH's castle. And in the\nsky nearby flies a beautiful WHITE BIRD. And then SARAH is amazed by\nwhat she sees. A closer look at the painting reveals that the WHITE\nBIRD is flying! It moves over the hedges and WE SEE a FIGURE waving.\n\nSARAH: Hoggle!\n\nSARAH, disturbed, backs away from the painting. And then, because it\nreally is as wonderful as it is scary, she goes back for another look\nand over her shoulder WE CAN SEE HOGGLE waving and we hear his tiny\nvoice.\n\nHOGGLE: Missy! Over here! This is the way to the castle!\n\nAnd SARAH strains to hear, and leans toward the painting, stretching\nher hand out and touching the painting, which makes it turn into a\nshimmering wall that her hand goes right through. And then she\ndisappears right through the painting.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nTHE GALLERY. And JARETH's portrait is now blank.\n\n38\tEXT: HEDGE MAZE - DAY\n\nSARAH rushes up to HOGGLE and throws her arms around him.\n\nSARAH: What happened to you? I was afraid I'd never see you again!\n\nHOGGLE: Ya know that trick with the wall? Damn, if it don't work with\nthe floor, as well!\n\nSARAH laughs and hugs him again.\n\n39\tINT : HEDGE MAZE - DAY\n\nSARAH and HOGGLE have been walking through the maze a long time. They\nare tired and bedraggled. SARAH pulls the watch out of her pocket and\nsighs.\n\nSARAH: An hour's gone by and I don't think we're more than four feet\nfrom where we started.\n\nHOGGLE: That's 'cause ya won't do what I tells ya. It's clear as day\nwe should be goin' this way ...\n\nHe turns a corner and walks smack into a hedge dead end. He howls in\npain and SARAH sighs and follows him.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nHOGGLE disentangling himself from the hedge.\n\nSARAH: Got any more suggestions?\n\nBefore HOGGLE can answer they are interrupted by a terrible\ngut-wrenching scream. It is positively unearthly. SARAH whirls around.\n\nSARAH: It sounds like it came from over there!\n\nHOGGLE points in the opposite direction.\n\nHOGGLE: Then let's go this way.\n\nSARAH frowns at him as the scream begins again.\n\nSARAH: Hoggle! It sounds like someone's being hurt!\n\nHOGGLE: Exactly why we should be headin' in the othermost direction!\n\nSARAH shakes her head in disgust and runs off as the screams become\nmore unbearable.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH, running through the hedge maze. Driven by the sound of the\nscreams, she has an unconscious ability to find her way through.\nHOGGLE, trying to keep up with her, keeps running into dead ends.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH emerging from the maze. She is stopped in her tracks by what\nshe sees and quickly covers her mouth to prevent herself from\nscreaming. HOGGLE emerges a moment later, barely pauses before he\nheads right back into the maze.\n\n40\tEXT: CLEARING - DAY\n\nSARAH'S POV - FOUR GOBLINS are torturing a huge creature (LUDO) that\nthey have hung by his ankle from a tree limb. They have also taken\npains to bind the CREATURE, who it is obvious could take an most of\nthem and win in a fairer fight. He is about nine feet tall,\npowerfully built, and his screams of frustrated agony are truly\nunbearable. The GOBLINS have devised a unique method of harassing\nhim. They ALL carry long sticks which have small, fierce, biting\nCREATURES on the end of them. The GOBLINS bat their sticks at LUDO,\nwho bellows and tries to swat back. Since he is tied, the NIPPERS are\nfree to bite him whenever they get near.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH, distraught, peeking out from behind a hedge.\n\nSARAH: The poor thing!\n\nHOGGLE peeks out from behind SARAH, then quickly ducks back. SARAH\nlooks for a way to stop the torture. She picks up a rock and\ncarefully aims it at the nearest GOBLIN. It hits his head and knocks\nhis helmet visor over his eyes. Blinded, the GOBLIN lurches around,\nswinging his nipper stick at the OTHER THREE.\n\nBLINDED GOBLIN: Hey! Who turned out the lights?\n\nThe OTHER GOBLINS see a new target and poke their nipper sticks\ntowards him. He takes off and runs blindly into the hedge maze. The\nOTHER THREE chase him, carrying the nipper sticks upright no that WE\nCAN SEE their progress in the BG.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH desperately tries to untie the huge knot that holds LUDO\nsuspended upside down. She can't undo it and yells for HOGGLE\n\nSARAH: Get out here, you coward!\n\nHOGGLE appears from behind his hedge. He hesitates, then pulls a\ndagger from his belt and joins SARAH. He cuts through the rope in one\nhack, and LUDO falls to the ground with a thud.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nThe nipper sticks start yammering away as they see SARAH and HOGGLE\nfreeing LUDO over the top of the hedge. The GOBLIN chase stops and\nthey head back to the clearing. HOGGLE dives for the bushes but a\ndetermined SARAH stays and pulls off the ropes. When LUDO is free, he\npicks up a huge log. As the FOUR GOBLINS come roaring back into the\nclearing, LUDO waves the log over his head. The GOBLIN charge\nimmediately shifts into a GOBLIN retreat, the nipper sticks yipping\nin fear.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nLUDO puts down the log and sits, his big shaggy head hanging down. He\ntaken one hand and wipes away a tear.\n\nLUDO: Ludo ... hurt.\n\nSARAH's heart breaks. This thing is the ultimate stuffed animal.\n\nSARAH: Is that your name? Ludo?\n\nHe nods and wipes away another tear.\n\nLUDO: Goblins ... mean to Ludo.\n\nSARAH: Oh, I know! They were terribly mean to you. (she moves closer\nand pats his arm) But it's all right now.\n\nLUDO sniffs and then breaks into the most endearing big dumb smile\nyou have ever seen.\n\nLUDO: Friend!\n\nSARAH: That's right, Ludo! I'm your friend. I'm Sarah.\n\nLUDO: Sarah ... friend!\n\nHOGGLE has come out from hiding during this exchange. He finds the\nwhole scene a bit nauseating. And an unnecessary nuisance. If there's\none thing he doesn't want, it's competition for SARAH.\n\nHOGGLE: I think I'm about ta be sick.\n\nThey ignore him and LUDO grins for all he's worth as SARAH beams up\nat him. HOGGLE pulls her over to one side.\n\nHOGGLE: I hope yer not thinkin' o' lettin' the beast traipse along,\nMissy. He'll just slow us up.\n\nSARAH: Are you kidding?! He'll be a great help! The goblins are\nscared of him because he's so fierce ...\n\nJust then LUDO shyly offers SARAH a flower that he has just picked\nfor her. She takes it and smiles at him.\n\nHOGGLE (sarcastically): I sees what ya mean.\n\nSARAH shrugs and gives LUDO a pat. HOGGLE sighs with frustration.\n\nHOGGLE: I just thinks we was doin' fine on our own.\n\nSARAH: And we can do even better with Ludo. (turns to Ludo) You want\nto help me save my baby brother, don't you, Ludo?\n\nLUDO: Save ... baby. Good!\n\nSARAH nods with satisfaction and strides into the hedge maze. LUDO\nright behind her. HOGGLE follows, clearly unhappy.\n\n41\tEXT: FOREST GATE - DAY\n\nSARAH, HOGGLE and LUDO come out of the hedge maze and see a wall with\ntwo SARAH-sized doors in it.\n\nHOGGLE: This is it, the entrance ta the Forbidden Forest. All we\ngotta do is pick a door ...\n\nSARAH: What difference does it make? Let's just go!\n\nLUDO quickly steps between SARAH and the doors.\n\nLUDO: One door ... good. One door ... bad.\n\nHOGGLE: Well, that's great news. (to Ludo) Don't suppose ya know\nwhich is which?\n\nSARAH skirts around LUDO and goes up to the doors for a closer look\nat them.\n\nLUDO: One door ... good. One door ...\n\nHOGGLE: All right, ya walkin' mountain! Ya made ya point.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH ignores the bickering behind her and examines the doors. Each\none has a door knocker on it. Both knockers are carved into faces,\nexcept one has the ring going through its ears and the other has it\nstuck in its mouth.\n\nSARAH (to herself): I guess once you choose a door ... all you have\nto do is knock.\n\nThe KNOCKER with the ring through its ears speaks.\n\nKNOCKER 1: Are you addressing me?\n\nSARAH jumps back, stunned.\n\nSARAH: You can talk!\n\nKNOCKER 1: What? What? You'll have to speak up!!\n\nKNOCKER 2: mmffn ... grnth ... sminvl ...\n\nSARAH turns to the OTHER KNOCKER.\n\nSARAH: You too!\n\nKNOCKER 2: ... gmft ... bmble ...\n\nSARAH shakes her head in amazement.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nThe BOYS are still at it.\n\nHOGGLE: If yer so smart why not show us another way inta the forest?\n\nLUDO: Ludo ... not ... know.\n\nHOGGLE: That figures, don't it? (he turns his back on Ludo, fuming)\nWhy the Missy wants an overgrown hill o' hair fer a friend is beyond\nme.\n\nLUDO tries to make HOGGLE feel better and pats him on the shoulder.\nHOGGLE shakes his hand off with a growl.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH is excited.\n\nSARAH: I love it! Talking doors!! (to Knocker 1) Are you the right\ndoor to the forest?\n\nKNOCKER 1: It doesn't do to ask me. For some reason I can't hear a\nthing.\n\nSARAH turns to KNOCKER 1.\n\nKNOCKER 1: No use asking him, either. All he does is mumble.\n\nKNOCKER 2 gets very excited.\n\nKNOCKER 2: thgt ... vrnf ... lcl ...\n\nSARAH: I get it! You can't talk with that ring in your mouth!\n\nShe removes the ring and looks at the FACE triumphantly.\n\nSARAH: Now, tell me which one of you is the right door to the forest.\n\nKNOCKER 2: Oh, I am. No question about it.\n\nSARAH: Great! How do we get you to open up?\n\nKNOCKER 2: One merely has to knock.\n\nSARAH: Of course, why didn't I think of that.\n\nShe tries to get the ring back in its mouth.\n\nKNOCKER 2: Oh no you don't, young lady! I've had just about enough of\nthat awful thing, thank you very much!\n\nSARAH: But how are we supposed to get through this door if you won't\nlet me knock on it?\n\nKNOCKER 2: Well, I really couldn't say now, could I?\n\nSARAH throws up her hands in disgust.\n\nKNOCKER 1: Oh do speak up, both of you? I can't hear a thing!\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nHOGGLE and LUDO are still at it.\n\nHOGGLE (conspiratorially): Ya know ... even if she does get the door\nopen, ya won't be able ta fit through. Why not make it easy on us all\nand take a hike?\n\nLUDO: Ludo ... Stay!\n\nHOGGLE is disgusted.\n\nHOGGLE: Yer quite the speechifier, ain't ya?\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH suddenly gives KNOCKER 2 an evil grin.\n\nSARAH: Are you sure there isn't anything I can do to change your mind?\n\nKNOCKER 2: Absolutely not! My lips are sealed!\n\nSARAH: That's what I thought!\n\nThe KNOCKER presses its lips firmly together. SARAH deftly squeezes\nits nose shut. It sputters for air and finally has to open its mouth\nbefore it suffocates. SARAH shoves the ring in with a gleeful cry of\ntriumph. She knocks, and the door swings open.\n\nSARAH: Let's go!\n\nShe goes through the door and HOGGLE and LUDO race to follow. They\nBOTH try to get through the door at the same time and get into such a\ntangle that the door closes before they can straighten themselves out.\n\nHOGGLE: Now you've done it!\n\nIn a frenzy, HOGGLE starts banging on both doors.\n\nHOGGLE: Missy! Missy, wait!\n\n42\tEXT: FORBIDDEN FOREST - DAY\n\nSARAH on the other side of the door. Except on this side, there is no\ndoor, just a long expanse of wall. The forest is very dark, and as\nits name suggests, very forbidding. SARAH can hear HOGGLE calling,\nbut it is very faint.\n\nSARAH (scared): Hoggle?\n\n43\tEXT: FOREST GATE - DAY\n\nHOGGLE is beating on the doors with such a frenzy that the other door\nswings open.\n\nHOGGLE: I'm coming ...\n\nHe rushes through the door and disappears. We can tell from his voice\nthat he is falling down a deep hole.\n\nHOGGLE (echoed): ... Miiiiiiiiissy!\n\nWe hear a huge splash. Then that door shuts and LUDO is all alone.\n\nLUDO: Sarah ... gone. Hoggle ... gone.\n\nHe is sad and confused. A FIGURE emerges from the hedge maze and\nbegins to walk along the wall, away from LUDO. It is the WISE ONE.\nLUDO brightens and chases after them.\n\nLUDO: Wait!\n\nThe WISE ONE stops and the HAT looks LUDO up and down.\n\nHAT: This ought to be a good one!\n\nLUDO: Ludo ... need ... door!\n\nWISE ONE: You have need of a door, do you? Ah, yes. A very useful\nthing, the door; also known as a portal or threshold -- and that\nwhich gives access, a gate or gangway ...\n\nHe continues walking and LUDO walks with him, listening intently.\n\nWISE ONE: ... also an entrance or entry, often accompanied by a\npropylaeum ...\n\nHAT (sighs): If only I had hands I could cover my ears ... that is,\nif I had ears ...\n\nWISE ONE: ... not to be confused with a window, or fenestration ...\n\n44\tEXT: FOREST - DAY\n\nSARAH has waited long enough.\n\nSARAH: Hoggle, Ludo ... where are you?\n\nShe reaches into her pocket and looks at the watch. The hour hand is\non the 7.\n\nSARAH: (whispers) Oh, Freddie! (she shoves the watch back into her\npocket) Well, you guys are going to have to catch up with me 'cause I\ncan't wait.\n\nThen determined, she strides off.\n\n45.\tINT: HOLE - DAY\n\nHOGGLE is in a pool at the bottom of a deep hole in the ground. There\nis a ledge just above him and he splashes violently trying to reach it.\n\nHOGGLE: Somebody help me! I can't swim!\n\n46\tEXT: FOREST - DAY\n\nSARAH is in a very thick, creepy part of the woods. She is clearly\nlost. She gets herself tangled in a thorn bush, and struggles with it\nto get herself free. Finally she does, and then, frustrated, sits\ndown on the ground.\n\nSARAH: Why does everything have to happen to me?\n\nBut there's no time to think about that because she hears the sound\nof a driving drum rhythm and then a wild-looking, spindly, leering\nLITTLE CREATURE comes scampering through the trees and into the\nclearing; and then ANOTHER, and ANOTHER and ANOTHER. SARAH is\nterrified as they approach her, but then not so terrified because the\nCREATURES aren't doing anything except dancing; wild, loose-limbed,\nfrenzied dancing. SARAH laughs, and can't help but be taken in by the\nwild spectacle. And then they begin to encircle her, still moving to\nthe wild rhythm.\n\nSARAH (laughing, moving): What are you?\n\nWILD THING 1: We're Wild Things, baby! Wild!\n\nWILD THING 2: Wild and free!\n\nWILD THING 3: Get down!\n\nAnd then more WILD THINGS appear, and these produce instruments. As\nand turn the drum rhythm into a frenzied upbeat number.\n\nWILD THING 1: You call that wild! I'll show you wild!\n\nAnd then he does an amazing thing, to say the least. He takes his\nhead off and rolls it along his arms from hand to hand like a\njuggler, then tosses it high in the air and deftly catches it on his\nshoulders. SARAH gasps and tries to get sway but another WILD THING\npushes her back into the middle of the melee.\n\nWILD THING 2: Cut me some slack and move on back!\n\nAnd they do, and, moving to the pounding rhythm, he takes his eyes\nout of his head and waves them at SARAH. He then tosses them on the\nground as if they were a pair of dice. They land at SARAH's feet\nlooking straight up.\n\nWILD THING 2: Snake eyes!\n\nSARAH is fascinated and repelled. And the beat gets hotter and the\nfrenzy more frenzied and she can't help getting a little wild\nherself. She begins to really dance.\n\nWILD THING 3: That's it, baby, get wild and free! But you'll never be\nas wild as me!\n\nAnd to prove it he takes his head off and begins to dribble it like a\nbasketball. WILD THING 1 leans over to SARAH and whispers\nconspiratorily.\n\nWILD THING 1: I wouldn't call that really _wild_, would you?\n\nSARAH: Well, it's ... uh ... sort of ...\n\nWILD THING 1: I'd call _this_ wild ...\n\nAnd he takes off his head, puts it on the ground as if it were a golf\nball, and then removes a leg and uses it as a golf club. The head\ngoes flying, right to SARAH. SARAH catches the head, then tries to\nget it back to its body but the body dances into the middle of all\nthe other WILD THINGS and she can't find it. So there's SARAH,\nrunning around like a chicken with two heads when suddenly the ears\nstart to flap and the head flies out of her hand. A WILD THING grabs\nher hand and turns her around.\n\nWILD THING 2: That was _wild_, baby. (he starts to dance) Now how\n'bout gettin' wild with me?\n\nBut SARAH has had enough.\n\nSARAH: I think I'll sit this one out ...\n\nWILD THING 1: Not with us you don't ...\n\nWILD THING 2: 'Cause we're _wild_!\n\nAnd then they're all over her, like a bunch of hyper puppies, and\nit's really too much.\n\nSARAH: Enough! I've got to find the castle!\n\nWILD THING 2: Well, why didn't you say so, baby!\n\nWILD THING 3: That's a _wild_ idea!\n\nAnd then his head flies off and he has to quickly grab it and put it\nback and meanwhile the OTHERS start pushing and pulling on SARAH and\npropel her into the woods.\n\nWILD THING 1: They got some wild goings on at the castle, baby!\n\n47\tINT: HOLE - DAY\n\nHOGGLE is holding on to the ledge with his fingertips. He doesn't\nhave the strength to hold on much longer and he looks down at the\nwater in mortal terror. He begins to slip just as a door opens in the\nsheer rock and JARETH enters, accompanied by GOBLINS.\n\nJARETH: Well, what have we here ... if it isn't little _Piggle_!\n\nHOGGLE screams and slips into the water. He tries to struggle back to\nthe ledge but the GOBLINS push at him with poles, laughing maniacally.\n\nJARETH: Did the girl decide she doesn't need you, now that she has\nthat beast?\n\nHOGGLE (angry): She wouldn't do nuthin' like that!\n\nJARETH leans over the water, laughing.\n\nJARETH: Don't you know she could never care for a repulsive thing\nlike you!\n\nHOGGLE splashes and tries to stay afloat.\n\nHOGGLE: She does care! Me 'n Sarah is friends!\n\nJARETH: Only until something better comes along ... and I've\ndefinitely got something better in mind!\n\nHOGGLE: Don't you hurt her!\n\nHOGGLE grabs on to the ledge and the gleeful GOBLINS push him back\ndown into the water.\n\nJARETH: What I do to her is my business ... and it is _inevitable_.\n\nHe grabs HOGGLE by the shirt front and lifts him out of the water.\n\nJARETH: You can be with me or against me.\n\nHOGGLE (terrified): Wh ... what do I gotta do?\n\nJARETH: I doubt if she can make it to the castle in time ...\n\nHe leans down and speaks directly into HOGGLE's face.\n\nJARETH: But just in case, I want you to deliver her to me.\n\nHOGGLE: Never! I'd rather die!\n\nJARETH sneers scornfully.\n\nJARETH: Then so you shall.\n\nHe drops HOGGLE back into the water. The GOBLINS shriek with delight.\nHOGGLE goes under and comes up sputtering.\n\nHOGGLE: Wait!\n\nJARETH was about to leave. He turns back to HOGGLE, a look of\namusement on his face.\n\nHOGGLE: I gotta know what ... what you'll do to her!\n\nHe splashes pathetically in a desperate attempt to stay above water.\n\nJARETH: I will do what ever amuses me ...\n\nHe reaches into his cloak and brings out a perfect peach.\n\nJARETH: All _you_ have to do is give her this.\n\nHe tosses HOGGLE the peach. HOGGLE catches it and immediately the\nwater starts to recede.\n\nJARETH: You've made a very wise decision.\n\nHe leaves, followed by the GOBLINS.\n\nHOGGLE: I didn't decide nuthin'!\n\nHOGGLE stares forlornly at the peach, and soon the water is gone and\nhe is sitting on cold, damp ground.\n\n48\tEXT: FOREST - DAY\n\nThe WILD THINGS are leading SARAH on a rocky path. She stumbles along\nbut they couldn't care less.\n\nSARAH: Are you sure this is the way to the castle?\n\nWILD THING 1: Oh, did you say \"the castle\"?\n\nWILD THING 2: I thought she said hassle!\n\nWILD THING 3: I thought she said rassle!\n\nWILD THING 1: Rassle! That's a _wild_ idea!\n\nHe leaps on SARAH and she flings him off.\n\nSARAH: OK, guys, fun's over.\n\nShe starts to leave and they pull her back.\n\nWILD THING 2: Over! It's just begun!\n\nAnd then the musicians are back and the dancing gets wilder than\never. The WILD THINGS totally surround SARAH, and though they aren't\nhurting her, they are definitely not letting her out. What they do is\nstart throwing their heads at each other and switching them.\n\nWILD THINGS 1, 2 & 3: Now this is _really_ wild!\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nA door opens in a nearby boulder and LUDO appears. In the background\nWE CAN SEE and hear the WISE ONE as he wanders off.\n\nWISE ONE: ... very often preceded by a porch, or portico, also\nverandah, and followed by a vestibule, otherwise known as an\nantechamber or foyer ...\n\nHAT: Why me?!!\n\nThe door closes. LUDO sees SARAH in the middle of this weirdness and\nis just a bit confused. SARAH sees him amidst the flying heads and\ncries out in relief.\n\nSARAH: Ludo!\n\nLUDO: Sarah ... not ... want ... castle?\n\nSARAH: Are you kidding?!! Get me out of here!!!\n\nLUDO approaches the WILD THINGS and grabs a head before it reaches\nits target and calmly tosses it into the trees.\n\nWILD THING 3: Hey, big fella! That's a little _too_ wild ...\n\nBut there's no time to talk because LUDO calmly catches the other\nheads and tosses them away. The bodies go scurrying after their\nheads, followed by the MUSICIANS. SARAH is free.\n\nSARAH: Oh, Ludo! I'm so glad you're here!\n\nShe gives him a kiss and he beams.\n\nSARAH: Where's Hoggle?\n\nLUDO: Hoggle ... in ... bad ... door.\n\nSARAH: We've got to find him! Do you think we can?\n\nLUDO is very confident. He spent a lot of time with the WISE ONE.\n\nLUDO: Ludo ... knows ... doors ...\n\nHe ambles off with SARAH following.\n\nLUDO: also ... portal ... or entrance ...\n\n49\tINT: HOLE - DAY\n\nHOGGLE is more depressed than ever. The peach is nowhere to be seen.\nSuddenly LUDO's head appears above.\n\nLUDO: Hoggle ... all ... wet.\n\nHOGGLE almost jumps out of his skin and then is totally outraged.\n\nHOGGLE: Ain't that the clever observation, ya feeble excuse fer a\nthinkin' creature!\n\nSARAH appears from behind LUDO.\n\nSARAH: Be nice, Hoggle. Or we won't get you out.\n\nHOGGLE's face lights up and all thoughts of anger are forgotten.\n\nHOGGLE: Missy!\n\n50\tINT: FOREST - DAY\n\nSARAH, HOGGLE and LUDO march through thick, overgrown forest. They do\nnot know that they are being spied on by JARETH'S GOBLINS.\n\n51\tINT: CLEARING - DAY\n\nThe THREESOME emerge into a clearing and see that they have come to a\nwide fissure that goes off in either direction as far as the eye can\nsee. It is spanned by a rickety bridge held by two thick wooden posts\non either side of the gap. SARAH eyes the bridge warily.\n\nSARAH: It doesn't look too strong but we don't have much choice ...\n\nSuddenly they are interrupted by a high-pitched, but powerful voice.\n\nVOICE (VO): Halt! Halt or be slain forthwith!\n\nAt first they don't see a thing and look around for the source of the\nvoice. Then, the imposing 18 inch high figure of DIDYMUS, resplendent\nin rakish hat and swashbuckling sword, emerges from behind one of the\nposts and stands in front of the bridge. LUDO and SARAH are\ndumbstruck. HOGGLE, however, is not at a loss for words.\n\nHOGGLE: Out of our way, ya wretched little rodent ...\n\nDIDYMUS looks directly at HOGGLE.\n\nDIDYMUS: You, sir, shall be the first to feel the point of my sword!\n\nHOGGLE snorts with derision and SARAH tries a more sensible approach.\n\nSARAH: Please, we really have to cross this bridge. It's a matter of\nlife and death!\n\nDIDYMUS shrugs elegantly.\n\nDIDYMUS: Under any other circumstances I would hasten to oblige you,\nfair damsel, for your mission sounds a worthy one.\n\nSARAH: Oh, it is!\n\nDIDYMUS: But I am sworn. Without my permission, none may pass.\n\nSARAH throws up her hands and HOGGLE mumbles under his breath. It\nappears to be up to LUDO to break the deadlock. He lifts DIDYMUS up\ninto the air and moves him to one side. They then start to walk\ntoward the bridge and DIDYMUS chases them, brandishing his sword.\n\nDIDYMUS: You dishonor me, varlets! En garde!\n\nTo his chagrin they ignore him and keep walking.\n\nDIDYMUS: Rapscallions! Duel ... or _die_!\n\nThis gets their attention and they turn to look at him, annoyed.\n\nHOGGLE: What _is_ this weasel babblin' about?\n\nIt is too much for DIDYMUS. He flings himself at HOGGLE with a mighty\nwar cry. HOGGLE tries to run for it but DIDYMUS is right behind him,\nadministering more than a few pinpricks in embarrassing places.\nHOGGLE dives behind a bush and DIDYMUS sniffs at his cowardice. He\ncomes back and faces LUDO.\n\nDIDYMUS: It is you I want, rogue of rogues. You who dealt me the\ngravest affront!\n\nAnd with that he jabs LUDO in the foot! LUDO is stunned, and howling,\nbegins to hop on his good foot. DIDYMUS, his head thrown back for a\ntriumphant yell, goes after LUDO with his sword flashing and there is\nnothing for LUDO to do but pick up a branch and defend himself. It is\nthe most mismatched duel in the history of chivalrous absurdity\nDIDYMUS moving at an incredible speed, parrying the mighty swipes of\nLUDO's branch with great skill -- and no small amount of difficulty.\nAnd LUDO fending off the incessant pinpricks of the little sword,\nleaping about with surprising agility -- and at a rate that exhausts\nhim totally. Finally, the two of them, breathing heavily, lower their\nweapons. And, to everyone's surprise, DIDYMUS throws down his sword.\n\nDIDYMUS: I no longer wish to slay you, for you are a truly noble\nknight.\n\nThen DIDYMUS strides up to him and, craning his neck, attempts to\nlook LUDO in the eyes.\n\nDIDYMUS: Destroy me if you will.\n\nLUDO quickly drops his branch in response. The whole thing has upset\nhis gentle nature terribly. DIDYMUS then holds out a tiny paw.\n\nDIDYMUS: Never have I met my match in battle, yet you, noble knight,\nhave fought me to a standstill.\n\nLUDO kneels and tentatively takes DIDYMUS' paw into his own huge hand.\n\nDIDYMUS: Let us be brothers henceforth, and fight for the right as\none!\n\nSARAH cheers and HOGGLE, unimpressed, rubs his sore rear. LUDO\nsmiles from ear to ear.\n\nLUDO: Ludo ... get ... brother!\n\nThen he and DIDYMUS exchange the ritual kiss on each cheek, which in\ntheir case is not easily accomplished. SARAH then turns practical.\n\nSARAH: Well, now that that's settled let's get going.\n\nShe heads for the bridge but DIDYMUS blocks her way.\n\nDIDYMUS: You forget my sacred vow, my lady. I cannot let you pass.\n\nSARAH is incensed.\n\nSARAH: But you said Ludo was your brother! How can you refuse him?!!\n\nDIDYMUS: I have taken an oath. I must defend it to the death.\n\nHOGGLE, enraged, turns on LUDO.\n\nHOGGLE: Some brother he turned out ta be!\n\nLUDO: Brother ... good!\n\nHOGGLE: Well, if he's so good, why won't he let us get on with our\nbusiness?\n\nLUDO scratches his head. He has no idea. SARAH sits down beside the\ncrestfallen DIDYMUS.\n\nSARAH: OK, let's handle this thing logically. What exactly have you\nsworn?\n\nDIDYMUS brandishes his sword.\n\nDIDYMUS: I have sworn with my life-blood, no one shall pass this way\nwithout my permission.\n\nSARAH: Then may we ... _have your permission_?\n\nDIDYMUS is stunned. HOGGLE and LUDO barely breathe. Slowly DIDYMUS\nlooks all around and then, with a courage greater than any he has\never had to call on before, he says it.\n\nDIDYMUS: Yes.\n\nAnd the sky doesn't fall, and the earth doesn't heave, and everything\nis exactly as it should be.\n\nSARAH: Thank you.\n\nDIDYMUS breathes a sigh of relief and steps aside to let them pass.\nLUDO is the first one to go over and that is unfortunate. Because the\nrickety bridge collapses under his weight. SARAH and HOGGLE jump back\non the ground near DIDYMUS just in time and poor LUDO swings over the\ndeep fissure, hanging on to one of the ropes that held the bridge.\nWith a mighty effort he hoists himself up on to the opposite side and\nlooks forlornly over at the others.\n\nSARAH: Oh no!\n\nSARAH crumples to the ground, and stares miserably at the broken\nbridge.\n\nHOGGLE: Now see what ya done, ya mush-brained mammoth!\n\nDIDYMUS: I, Sir Didymus, take responsibility for the actions of my\nbrother, my lady. Lash out at me if you must.\n\nSARAH: I'm not mad at Ludo, Sir Didymus. I'm just upset because time\nis running out and I have to rescue my baby brother.\n\nDIDYMUS is struck to the very roots of his chivalry.\n\nDIDYMUS: You mean to rescue _a child_?!!\n\nSARAH: The goblin king took him, and I've only got ...\n\nShe takes out the watch. The hour hand is on the 5.\n\nSARAH: ... five hours to get him back.\n\nDIDYMUS yells across to LUDO.\n\nDIDYMUS: Is this your quest, too, my brother?\n\nLUDO: Save ... baby.\n\nDIDYMUS is overwhelmed.\n\nDIDYMUS: Then I shall join you, lady. I am at your service, upon my\nsword.\n\nHe bows low before SARAH and she smiles.\n\nSARAH: I happily accept your fealty, Sir Didymus.\n\nHOGGLE frowns with displeasure at this latest development.\n\nHOGGLE: This is all well an' good, Missy. But we still got one little\nproblem.\n\nThey all look across the fissure at LUDO.\n\nLUDO: Ludo ... friends.\n\nHOGGLE: Yes, yes. We're friends. Very nice. What's that got ta do\nwith us gettin' over there without a bridge?\n\nLUDO: Rocks ... friends.\n\nHOGGLE: We're wastin' our time, Missy. Let's you an' me go find\nanother ...\n\nHe is interrupted by LUDO bellowing, which is followed by a\nsympathetic rumbling. Suddenly rocks pile in from both directions\nuntil there is a pile in the fissure high enough for them to walk\nacross.\n\nLUDO: Rocks ... friends!\n\nSARAH (laughing): They sure are, Ludo!\n\nShe skips happily across followed by a sullen HOGGLE. DIDYMUS\nwhistles and is quickly joined by a tail-wagging SHEEPDOG. SARAH\ngasps, he is the spitting image of her own MERLIN.\n\nSARAH: It's ...\n\nDIDYMUS: Ambrosius! My noble steed.\n\nSARAH laughs and shrugs. Nothing surprises her in the labyrinth.\n\n52\tEXT: FOREST - NIGHT\n\nThe edge of the forest. From here you can see the castle in the\ndistance, just across the dry, cracked plain. The sky is full of\nstars. SARAH, HOGGLE, LUDO and DIDYMUS are sitting around a fire.\n\nDIDYMUS: What will you do after we save the child, my lady?\n\nSARAH: Take him home, of course! That is, if I can figure out how.\n\nDIDYMUS: What is your kingdom like? Do you have many knights to\ndefend your honor?\n\nSARAH: Not even one.\n\nDIDYMUS: It cannot be! What bitter place is this that does such\ndishonor to my lady?\n\nSARAH: It's a place where ... where nobody really sees me.\n\nLUDO: Ludo ... see ... Sarah!\n\nSARAH: (laughs) I know you do, Ludo. (she turns to Didymus) And\nthanks to you, Sir Didymus, I finally have a knight.\n\nHe bows graciously. HOGGLE, who has been watching this scene, feels\nrejected and miserable. He gets up and wanders away from the fire.\nAfter a moment, SARAH follows him.\n\nSARAH: Don't you feel like resting?\n\nHOGGLE: I ain't tired.\n\nSARAH: Me neither. What I am is hungry.\n\nHOGGLE winces but SARAH doesn't notice. SARAH looks back at LUDO and\nDIDYMUS. LUDO lies on his back snoring loudly. DIDYMUS dozes against\nAMBROSIUS' side.\n\nSARAH: They're both wonderful, aren't they?\n\nHOGGLE: They're alright.\n\nSARAH: They're more than that! They're loyal and strong ... and with\ntheir help I'm going to beat Jareth!\n\nHOGGLE shakes his head sadly. SARAH speaks as an afterthought.\n\nSARAH: And yours, too, of course.\n\nHOGGLE: I ain't no fighter ...\n\nShe shrugs that off and wanders away to look out at the castle.\nHOGGLE goes through agony for a moment, and then makes a decision.\n\nHOGGLE: Missy ... if you're hungry ...\n\nHe holds out the peach that JARETH gave him: the world's most\ndelicious looking peach.\n\nSARAH: Oh, great!\n\nShe happily taken the peach and bites. It takes everything HOGGLE has\nto not put his hands over his ears. She takes another bite and then\nstumbles.\n\nSARAH (laughing): Everything's dancing ...\n\nShe looks up at the sky, exhilarated.\n\nSARAH: Even the stars are dancing!\n\nHOGGLE turns and walks back to the fire. SARAH stumbles about as she\ngazes happily at the sky.\n\n53\tINT: CASTLE - NIGHT\n\nFREDDIE is leading the GOBLINS on a merry chase. He crawls around the\nroom, pulling things off shelves. A GOBLIN is on his hands and knees\nin front of JARETH polishing his boots. JARETH kicks the GOBLIN and\nsends him flying across the room. This makes FREDDIE laugh and he\npulls a book off the shelf and throws it. It hits a GOBLIN on the\nhead. JARETH scoops up FREDDIE and puts him in his cradle. He sits\ndown next to him.\n\nJARETH: Little goblin-to-be, I have something to amuse you.\n\nHe waves his hands in front of FREDDIE and suddenly beautiful\ncrystalline balls appear in them. He runs them over his fingers like\nso many coins, their molten light so dazzling that FREDDIE kicks up\nhis legs with excitement. And WE CAN SEE that at the end of his\npajamas are two wizened goblin feet! JARETH laughs and flings the\nballs into the air and they turn into bubbles, beautiful, mesmerizing\nbubbles.\n\nJARETH: Soon, little one. Very, very soon ...\n\nAnd they both watch the bubbles as they fly out the window and over\nthe labyrinth, coldly beautiful against the darkening sky.\n\n54\tEXT: FOREST - NIGHT\n\nSARAH's hand opens slowly and the half-eaten peach falls to the\nground. She stares out into the sky, mesmerized. The bubbles are\napproaching; dazzling, dancing bubbles. And then she hears music,\nhaunting, spell-casting music. The bubbles come closer and WE CAN SEE\nthat each one contains a TWIRLING DANCER, a DANCER just like the one\nin SARAH's music box. She gets up and follows them.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nHOGGLE watching from the woods.\n\nHOGGLE: Damn you, Jareth! (He turns and begins to walk away) And damn\nme too!\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nA bubble, with SARAH inside it, floating through the sky. She appears\nenchanted, and she begins to twirl, just like the OTHER DANCERS.\n\n55\tEXT: BALLROOM - NIGHT\n\nA giant bubble, with a magnificent ballroom inside it. Tiny bubbles\nrush to join it. In one of them is SARAH.\n\n56\tINT: BALLROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe music changes and now SARAH is inside the ballroom. It is a\nmagnificent spectacle with all the beauty and decadence of an 18th\nCentury Venetian ball. Magnificently dressed DANCERS swirl to the\nmusic in an incredibly opulent setting. But when you look closer you\nsense decay just beneath the surface; things are threadbare, faded.\nThe GUESTS wear masks that are elegant parodies of goblin faces,\ngiving them all a slightly sinister look. And there is something very\nprovocative about all of them; the WOMEN have bare shoulders and\ndaring decolletage, many of the MEN have their shirts open to the\nwaist. Some of them lounge against the wall indolently and there is\nthe feeling that the party has been going on all night. In this\nsetting SARAH is the picture of innocence. TWO WOMEN snickering\nbehind their fans as SARAH approaches, and she is suddenly terribly\nself-conscious. How plain She feels amidst all this! She looks into\none of the many mirrors that line the ballroom and sighs at her\nimage. Then suddenly she sees something in the mirror that makes her\ngasp.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nThe mirror, and in it the reflection of a resplendent JARETH dancing\nwith a particularly exotic-looking WOMAN. SARAH whirls around, trying\nto get another glimpse of JARETH. She is so intent on trying to see\nhim that she doesn't notice that she is being stared at brazenly by a\nYOUNG MAN leaning against the wall. He moves next to her and whispers\nsomething into her ear. She hurries away, shocked; and the YOUNG MAN\nthrows back his head and laughs. And JARETH sees the whole thing.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH is approached by a MIDDLE-AGED MAN who has a box hanging at\nwaist height from a ribbon around his neck. It looks like SARAH's\nmusic box. She looks down at it with interest and he throws open the\ncover. But there is no dancer inside, instead there is a stick carved\nlike a snake. It shoots out at SARAH and she cries out and backs\naway. ALL THE PEOPLE around her laugh and she moves hurriedly on.\nJARETH, who is dancing with an even more beautiful WOMAN than before,\nwatches SARAH.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH is looking for JARETH. She spots him and sees him whisper\nsomething to his partner who smiles knowingly from beneath her mask\nand licks her lips. SARAH blushes and turns away and finds herself\nlooking into another mirror. But in the reflection, JARETH isn't with\na partner. He is standing alone, the DANCERS a whirling blur around\nhim, and he is looking straight at her. SARAH, whirling around to\nface the crowd and she sees JARETH with yet a third BEAUTY. And then\nshe realizes that it is herself! In a trance-like state she moves\nthrough the CROWD to get a better look.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH'S POV - She is whirling in JARETH's arms, and she is the most\nbeautiful woman at the ball. JARETH smiles down at her and the\nattraction between them is palpable.\n\nJARETH: You look like a queen.\n\nSARAH looks up at him, thrilled by his words.\n\nSARAH: I ... I feel like ... I ... don't know what I feel ...\n\nJARETH (smiling): Don't you?\n\nAnd he whirls her around dizzyingly, so dizzyingly that she swoons in\nhis arms. He catches her before she can fall very far, tightening his\ngrip around her waist.\n\nSARAH: Are we ... are we in a bubble?\n\nJARETH: Yes, we are. A dream bubble ... where your dreams can come\ntrue.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nOUR SARAH is being jostled by the crowd. She stumbles and almost\nfalls on top of a COUPLE on a bench. The WOMAN is sprawled across the\nlap of the MAN who wears a mask with a very phallic nose. SARAH backs\naway from them, frightened.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nJARETH and SARAH, dancing. She is smiling up at him, he has never\nlooked more handsome. There is something more open about him, as if\nhe, too, is caught up in the moment. He nuzzles her hair with his\nlips and whispers in her ear.\n\nJARETH (whispering): My Queen!\n\nThen he begins a song. A song that tells SARAH he will give her\neverything she wants, even things she doesn't know she wants. A song\nthat says forget it all; all the restrictions, all the powerlessness.\nForget and stay in the dream.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nOUR SARAH watches, mesmerized. But every time she tries to get closer\nto JARETH and SARAH she in jostled by a lascivious ADMIRER, pushed\nout of the way by WOMEN laughingly being chased by MEN. She stumbles\nagainst a wall and a door opens. Inside, pillow feathers are flying\nand she can't make out what the SEVERAL PEOPLE are doing. A WOMAN\ncomes up to the doorway, winks at SARAH, and closes the door.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nJARETH finishes the song and SARAH looks up at him, smiling. He moves\nhis face closer to hers and she closes her eyes. His face comes\ncloser, and closer.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nOUR SARAH shrinks back from what she is seeing. She turns and runs,\npushing herself though the languid CROWD, right into the bubble\nitself.\n\n57\tEXT: BALL - NIGHT\n\nSARAH comes crashing through the bubble and the whole ballroom\ncrumbles. In seconds it resembles nothing so much as a junkyard.\n\n58\tEXT JUNK CITY - NIGHT\n\nSARAH runs through the streets of a part-market, part-junkyard. There\nare piles of rubble and junk everywhere, and between them are tents\nfrom which PEOPLE hawk objects of all kinds. Some of them approach\nSARAH and she pushes them away, sobbing.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH'S POV - A RED TENT, and standing in front of it is an OLD WOMAN\nstooped over from the objects piled high on her back. She beckons to\nSARAH and pulls the tent flap aside.\n\nJUNK WOMAN: 'Ere it is, Dearie. All the fings you want, all the fings\nyou need.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nThe flap opens wider and inside the tent WE CAN SEE SARAH's room!\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH gasps at the sight and runs headlong into the tent. She trips\nover the threshold and lands face down on her bed.\n\n59\tINT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nSARAH sits up on the bed and looks around the room. She shakes her\nhead and laughs.\n\nSARAH: What a dream!\n\nShe gets up and stretches, then walks over to the mirror. She smiles\nat her reflection.\n\nSARAH: Yep, you've got quite an imagination, kid, Just what a great\nactress needs.\n\nShe walks over to the bed and picks up Lancelot the bear.\n\nSARAH: How about a midnight snack, Sir Lance ...\n\nShe goes over to the door and opens it.\n\n60\tEXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT\n\nSARAH'S POV - THE MARKET/JUNKYARD TEEMING WITH ACTIVITY.\nThe JUNK WOMAN peers in.\n\nJUNK WOMAN: 'Aven't you got everythin' you need, Dearie?\n\n61\tINT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nSARAH screams and slams the door. She buries her face in the bear.\n\nSARAH: It _is_ just a dream!\n\nShe takes a deep breath and goes to the door again. She opens it very\nslowly.\n\n62\tEXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT\n\nSARAH'S POV - THE SAME TEEMING ACTIVITY. The JUNK WOMAN peers in\nagain.\n\nJUNK WOMAN: Best to stay in there, where it's safe, Dearie. Don't\nknow what might 'appen to you out 'ere.\n\n63\tINT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nSARAH clams the door again and rushes over to the window. A GROUP OF\nREVELLERS peer in at her and laugh. She quickly pulls the curtains\nclosed and walks back to the center of the room. She stands clutching\nthe bear, then looks up at her reflection in the mirror.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH'S reflection. Herself as a very old woman, clutching a teddy\nbear.\n\nOLD SARAH: Best to stay in here where it's safe. Don't know what\nmight happen to you out there.\n\nSARAH steps back from the mirror and suddenly the floor becomes a sea\nof mud and all the objects in the room come falling down on her. As\nshe tries to rise out of the muck more objects land on and around her\nand pull her down.\n\nSARAH: Help! Somebody help me!\n\n64\tEXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT\n\nLUDO and DIDYMUS desperately searching for SARAH, DIDYMUS riding his\nDOG.\n\n65\tINT: TAVERN TENT - NIGHT\n\nHOGGLE sits at a bar, drowning his sorrows. A JUNK MAN/BARTENDER\nworks behind the bar. HOGGLE slams his cup down.\n\nHOGGLE: Another!\n\nThe BARTENDER holds out his hand greedily. HOGGLE pulls a treasure\noff his belt and slams it on the bar. The BARTENDER pours.\n\n66\tEXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT\n\nDIDYMUS and LUDO approach the red tent. They spy the JUNK WOMAN.\n\nDIDYMUS: Did you see a noble maiden pass this way?\n\nJUNK WOMAN: A noble maiden, eh? What would she be doin' in a place\nlike this?\n\nDIDYMUS: She's on a rescue mission ...\n\nThe JUNK WOMAN finds this hilarious.\n\nJUNK WOMAN: A rescue mission, ha! You're in the wrong place, for\nsure! The only fings we cares about rescuin' around 'ere is our\nworldly goods!\n\nShe takes an oil lamp off her back and shines it on her sleeve for\nemphasis.\n\n67\tINT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nSARAH is drowning in a sea of junk. She hears DIDYMUS and cries out\nhopefully.\n\nSARAH: Didymus, in here! Help me!\n\nThe door opens and the JUNK WOMAN peers inside.\n\nJUNK WOMAN: Don't worry, Dearie. I sent 'im away!\n\nSARAH groans.\n\nJUNK WOMAN: Knew you wouldn't want to be leavin' your nice fings for\nno rescue mission.\n\nSARAH: Oh my god! Freddie!\n\nJUNK WOMAN: Freddie? Is that one of them dolls over there ... or that\nnice teddy?\n\nSARAH struggles for the door in the sea of junk.\n\nSARAH: No! He's my brother! And I've got to save him!\n\nShe continues pushing through the junk.\n\nJUNK WOMAN: No you don't, Dearie. You can stay right 'ere with all\nyour pretty fings ...\n\nSARAH knows what her choice has to be.\n\nSARAH: I know I can. (joyous) But I don't want to!\n\nShe lifts herself out of the junk with a mighty heave and stands in\nthe doorway. She looks down at the JUNK WOMAN triumphantly.\n\nSARAH: Now get out of my way!\n\n68\tEXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT\n\nSARAH runs out of the tent, a look of triumph on her face.\n\nThe JUNK WOMAN pulls something off her own pile and holds it out to\nSARAH.\n\nJUNK WOMAN: Wait, Dearie! Look at this!\n\nShe holds out SARAH's music box, opens it, and the little DANCER\ntwirls inside.\n\nSARAH (grinning): Keep it!\n\nAnd she is off. As SARAH goes the CAMERA LINGERS on the JUNK WOMAN.\nAnd we begin to move around to her other side and even though we had\njust seen her from all sides, we now see something very, very\ndifferent. Where the other side of the woman should be WE SEE a\ncross-section of her, with JARETH inside. His head is beneath the\npile of junk and his hand is inside her head making it laugh. He is\nthe puppeteer operating the JUNK LADY, as indeed, she has been\noperated. JARETH is mad.\n\nJARETH: Damn.\n\n69\tEXT: CASTLE GATE - NIGHT\n\nLUDO and DIDYMUS sit forlornly at the gate. SARAH appears out of the\nnight.\n\nDIDYMUS: My lady!\n\nLUDO leaps to his feet.\n\nLUDO: Sarah ... safe!\n\nSARAH rushes into his arms.\n\nDIDYMUS: Is Hoggle not with you?\n\nSARAH pulls away from LUDO.\n\nSARAH: Hoggle made his choice, he's ... not part of the mission\nanymore.\n\nDIDYMUS (angry): The coward!\n\nLUDO: Hoggle ... good!\n\nSARAH shrugs, and smiles at him.\n\nSARAH: Maybe. But there's no time to discuss it. We've got a baby to\nrescue, remember!\n\nShe leads them through the gates.\n\n70\tEXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT\n\nStreets full of hovels encircle the castle. This is where the GOBLINS\nlive. As SARAH, LUDO and HOGGLE walk through the dark, eerie streets\nthey are met by the slamming of shutters and the extinguishing of\nlights.\n\nDIDYMUS: Methinks they are expecting us, my lady.\n\nA CHILD GOBLIN peers at them from an open doorway. A FEMALE GOBLIN\nsees him and drags him inside and slams the door.\n\nSARAH (grimly): Methinks you're right!\n\n71\tINT: TAVERN - NIGHT\n\nHOGGLE is still at it. He pulls his belt off his body and WE SEE that\nthe only treasure left is SARAH's plastic circlet. He slowly pulls it\noff and stares at it. The BARTENDER approaches, his eyes lighting up\nat the eight of this treasure.\n\nBARTENDER: Another?\n\nHOGGLE hesitates, then hands the circlet over. The BARTENDER bites it\nand his face lights up with glee.\n\nBARTENDER: Plastic!\n\nHe goes to get the drink and HOGGLE puts his face down on the bar and\nsobs.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nAt the other end of the bar sits the WISE ONE. The HAT looks over at\nHOGGLE and shakes his head knowingly.\n\nHAT: Drinkin' to forget, eh, buddy?\n\nHOGGLE looks up.\n\nWISE ONE: To forget, ah yes. To suffer a mental lapse, to obliterate\nfrom one's consciousness, to suffer amnesia, a blank or fugue, to\ndrink the waters of Lethe ...\n\nHOGGLE (drunkenly): What's Lethe ...\n\nWISE ONE: The waters of forgetfulness. They remove from our minds\nwhat is too painful to remember ...\n\nHOGGLE looks thoughtfully at the drink in his hand.\n\nWISE ONE: ... but with the memory goes our wisdom, or knowledge, that\nwhich brings us understanding, also enlightenment ...\n\nBut there is no one to continue benefitting from the WISE ONE's\npearls. HOGGLE is gone.\n\nHAT: You can cool it down there ... he's gone ...\n\nWISE ONE: ... a grasp of things, a depth or profundity of thought ...\n\nThe HAT sighs and looks over at the BARTENDER who is still admiring\nhis plastic treasure.\n\nHAT: Another one over here ... and make it a double ...\n\n72\tEXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT\n\nSARAH, LUDO and DIDYMUS emerge into the vast courtyard outside the\ncastle. It in eerily quiet. Too quiet.\n\nSARAH: We're going to make it!\n\nDIDYMUS sniffs the air.\n\nDIDYMUS: I am less than sure ...\n\nThey are interrupted by a high-pitched shriek as a GOBLIN jumps on\nLUDO's back. Then the courtyard is filled with GOBLINS, what seems\nlike the whole army, coming right at them. DIDYMUS fends off the\nVANGUARD PARTY with his sword and LUDO punches out the ones that get\nby him. DIDYMUS unswords a GOBLIN and his weapon goes flying. SARAH\npicks it up and does some parrying of her own. But there are too many\nof them. The threesome turn and run.\n\n73\tINT: CASTLE - NIGHT\n\nJARETH stands by the window, watching the battle. The WHITE BIRD sits\non his shoulder. JARETH looks over at FREDDIE who stands holding on\nto the side of the cradle. JARETH smiles and turns back to the melee\nbelow. The BIRD flies out the window.\n\n74\tEXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT\n\nSARAH, LUDO and DIDYMUS race down the streets. The GOBLINS are in hot\npursuit.\n\n75\tEXT: STREET - NIGHT\n\nThey come careening around a corner and it seems that they have\nescaped their pursuers. The sound of the GOBLINS seems to be getting\nfarther away.\n\nSARAH: I think we lost them.\n\nThey turn and see that, unfortunately they have come full circle and\nare right back in the courtyard. LUDO climbs part way up a wall and\nlooks over the streets.\n\nDIDYMUS: What do you see, my brother?\n\nLUDO gulps. What he sees is the GOBLIN ARMY coming down every street\nright towards them.\n\nLUDO: Ludo ... see ... trouble!\n\nAnd then the trouble arrives and SARAH and DIDYMUS are heavily into\nswordplay. LUDO tries clumsily to get down and is tormented by\nGOBLINS who prick at him with their spears. SARAH looks up and sees\nhis predicament. She gets an idea.\n\nSARAH: Call the rocks, Ludo! Call the rocks!\n\nLUDO makes a heroic effort and gets to the top of the wall.\n\nHe then throws his head back and bellows.\n\n76\tEXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT\n\nAn enormous rumbling is heard and soon the streets are filled with\nboulders, all careening towards LUDO. They knock GOBLINS out of their\npath like so many bowling pins.\n\n77\tEXT: COURTYARD - NIGHT\n\nSARAH and DIDYMUS fight bravely. LUDO keeps bellowing and throwing\noff the occasional GOBLIN that is stupid enough to jump on him. Soon\nthe rocks reach the courtyard and form a barrier between the\nTHREESOME and their ATTACKERS. LUDO reaches down and lifts SARAH and\nDIDYMUS on to the wall. They jump and disappear into the castle\nenclave.\n\n78\tINT: CASTLE - NIGHT\n\nA door opens in a dark part of the castle. LUDO, SARAH and DIDYMUS\nenter. They look around and quickly tip-toe down a dark corridor.\nThey turn a corner and see some GOBLINS marching their way. They duck\nout of sight.\n\n79\tEXT: CASTLE - NIGHT\n\nThe main entrance to the castle. TWO-GOBLIN GUARDS stand outside the\nlarge wooden doors. The results of the THREESOME's escape can be\nheard in the distance. A FIGURE staggers out of the dark, singing\ndrunkenly. It is HOGGLE.\n\nHOGGLE: \" ... it's so cold in the night with no gold to keep me warm\n... \"\n\nHe trips over his feet as he approaches the GUARD.\n\nGUARD: Who goes there?\n\nHOGGLE \" ... so cold, oh so cold ... \"\n\nGUARD 2: Don't worry about him. He's on Jareth's payroll now.\n\nHOGGLE falls to the ground, then picks himself up.\n\nHOGGLE: Thash right. Jareth owes me sumthin' ... an' I'm here ta\ncollect ...\n\nThey laugh at him, then step aside and let him enter.\n\n80\tINT: CASTLE - NIGHT\n\nA GROUP OF GOBLINS stand in a circle in a corridor. They torment a\ntiny, fuzzy yapping CREATURE with their nipper sticks. The CREATURE\ngets away from them and goes scurrying down the corridor. The GOBLINS\nlaugh. It turns a corner and starts yapping for all it's worth.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH, LUDO and DIDYMUS pressed against the wall, trying to not be\nnoticed. Unfortunately the little CREATURE has no sympathy for their\nplight. It stands at their feet, making a ruckus.\n\nSARAH (whispering): Shut up, you little monster!\n\nLUDO bends down to pet it in the hopes of quieting it.\n\nLUDO: Nice ... thing ...\n\nBut the CREATURE doesn't want a pet. It sinks its teeth into LUDO's\nhand. LUDO howls.\n\nDIDYMUS: I fear that this means trouble.\n\nThe GOBLINS yell and start running down the corridor.\n\nSARAH: Run for it!\n\nThey are off, the CREATURE and the GOBLINS at their heels.\n\n81\tINT: CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\nThe THREE are running for all they're worth. SARAH pulls the watch\nout of her pocket. It is on the 12:30.\n\nSARAH: Only a half hour left! We've got to find Freddie!\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nYet another GROUP OF GOBLINS running right toward them. They stop in\ntheir tracks and start running in the opposite direction.\n\n82\tINT: INNER COURTYARD - NIGHT\n\nThe THREE come careening into the long narrow inner courtyard.\nBalconies look down on it from the floor above. Opposite them is a\nlarge ornate door. They have a lead on the GOBLINS chasing them, but\nnot for long.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nOn one of the balconies a particularly repulsive little GOBLIN laughs\nsadistically. The THREE look up and see the GOBLIN with his hands on\na huge lever. He pushes it down gleefully and the floor opens up in\nfront of the THREESOME. It appears to be a bottomless pit, too wide\nto leap across. Horrified they look behind them and see the GOBLINS\ngaining on them. And they're throwing spears! Suddenly there is a\ntriumphant yell from the balcony opposite the repulsive GOBLIN, and\nthen a FIGURE leaps off it swinging on a rope.\n\nSARAH: Hoggle!\n\nIt certainly is! He wrestles with the hideous GOBLIN and in the\nstruggle it falls screaming into the pit. HOGGLE then grabs the lever\nand it is not a second too soon. The pursuing GOBLINS are entering\nthe courtyard.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nThe floor closes and the THREE run to the door. An enraged PURSUER\naims a spear at HOGGLE. He is hit. SARAH screams as LUDO struggles\nwith the door. It won't budge and he begins to smash his body against\nit.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nA seemingly half-dead HOGGLE staggers to his feet and throws his body\non the lever. He appears to faint from the strain but the weight of\nhis body pushes the lever and the floor opens again.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nThe enraged GOBLINS are stopped in their tracks by the yawning pit.\nThey hurl spears at the THREESOME but it is to no avail. LUDO smashes\ndown the door and they run in.\n\n83\tINT: JARETH'S QUARTERS - NIGHT\n\nSARAH, DIDYMUS, and LUDO carrying HOGGLE enter the room where we have\nseen JARETH and FREDDIE. They lock the door behind them. No one is\nthere and FREDDIE's cradle is rocking, as if someone had removed him\nonly moments before. LUDO places HOGGLE down and SARAH looks\nfeverishly around the room. She spots a door.\n\nSARAH: That's the only way he could have gone!\n\nShe runs to the door and LUDO and DIDYMUS follow.\n\nSARAH: No. I have to face him alone!\n\nDIDYMUS: But, my lady ...\n\nHe is interrupted by the sound of GOBLINS in pursuit. They start\ntrying to smash down the door. LUDO runs to it and presses his body\nagainst it. HOGGLE moans and DIDYMUS and SARAH run to his side.\n\nHOGGLE: I don't expect ya to fergive me, Missy, but ...\n\nShe puts her finger to his lips.\n\nSARAH: Forgive you for what? Saving our lives?\n\nHOGGLE: But, I betrayed ya, I gave ya that damned peach ...\n\nSARAH: Ssh! You did the only thing you could do ...\n\nShe looks down at his empty belt.\n\nSARAH: ... and I see you lost all your treasures in the process.\n\nHOGGLE: I don't care if I never sees another treasure again!\n\nSARAH (smiles): Here. Just in case you change your mind.\n\nShe slips off her mother's ring and presses it into HOGGLE's hand. He\nis overwhelmed and SARAH smiles at his pleasure.\n\nHOGGLE: And Jareth said ya could never love me.\n\nSARAH: Jareth doesn't know everything.\n\nShe leaps to her feet and HOGGLE moans.\n\nSARAH: Take care of him, Didymus.\n\nDIDYMUS: I'll guard the valiant Hoggle with my life!\n\nThe GOBLINS give the door a particularly loud smash and LUDO presses\nagainst the door even harder.\n\nLUDO: Ludo ... too!\n\nShe runs to the other door and stops to look back at them.\n\nSARAH: No maiden could have wished for nobler knights.\n\nAnd she is gone.\n\n84\tESCHER ROTUNDA - NIGHT\n\nSARAH enters an overwhelming room with many staircases, balconies and\ndoorways at different heights and at all kinds of strange angles that\nobviously have no relation to what we know as gravity. Her knees\nbuckling from vertigo. Then she gasps.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nJARETH is sitting on the wall with all the ease of a fly.\n\nJARETH: I've been expecting you.\n\nSARAH stumbles and falls into the room, ending up on the ceiling. She\ntries to adjust to being upside down.\n\nSARAH: Where's Freddie?!!!\n\nShe has to look down and sideways to see JARETH and it is clearly\ngrueling.\n\nJARETH: He's right there.\n\nAnd he points to one of the stairways that juts out at a right angle\nfrom the wall. FREDDIE is climbing up the stairs happily, but from\nSARAH's point of view it looks like he will fall when he gets to the\ntop.\n\nSARAH (screaming): Freddie! No!!!\n\nFREDDIE gets to the top but doesn't fall, instead he ends up crawling\nup the wall. SARAH sighs with relief and closes her eyes. This sends\nher reeling and she ends up in one of the archways. She tries to\norient herself but there is no up, no down, no sideways. And the BABY\nis about to crawl off a balcony! SARAH screams and JARETH laughs. He\nbegins a song that tells SARAH she never really understood what was\ngain on. Nothing is what it appears to be, not even things like \"up\"\nand \"down.\"\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nFREDDIE in the most precarious-looking situation yet, at the top of a\nstaircase. He hesitates to crawl down, and to lure him, JARETH\ncreates a ball out of thin air and throws it to the BABY. Of course,\nit bounces up. And all the while his song is taunting SARAH. She\nturns away from him and looks into the large mirror framed in the\narchway. She sees endless SARAHS. And while she's looking, the first\nreflection runs to the left, the reflection behind that to the right,\nand so on all the way down the line. And SARAH's still standing\nthere! She falls backwards and ends up standing on the floor,\nwatching FREDDIE chase his ball across the ceiling. JARETH dances on\nthe wall now as he is about to finish his song. And there is FREDDIE\non one of the balconies facing out of the rotunda. If he falls off\nthat, he'll really fall! SARAH runs up the opposite wall and finds\nthat there is sheer space between her and the BABY. The only way to\nreach him is to jump. She looks at JARETH who grins at her, then at\nFREDDIE who is teetering on the edge. As JARETH comes to the end of\nthe song there is nothing to do but jump. She looks at JARETH and\ncan't repress a grin of her own.\n\nSARAH: Like the man said, \"nothing is what it appears to be!\"\n\nShe jumps.\n\n85\tINT: JARETH'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT\n\nSARAH falls right on to a magnificent huge bed. Opposite her JARETH\nsits in a chair. FREDDIE, wrapped in a blanket, is gurgling on his\nlap. SARAH reaches into her pocket and pulls out the watch. It is a\nfew minutes before 13. JARETH stands up.\n\nJARETH: There's still time.\n\nHe gestures to a clock on the wall that shows the same time as her\nwatch. He places FREDDIE into a cradle and comes over to the bed. He\nlooks down at her.\n\nJARETH: Besides, I'm no longer interested in having a little goblin\nprince. I've decided I'd much rather have a queen.\n\nHe looks into her eyes for a moment. SARAH doesn't look away.\nInstead, she slowly eases herself off the bed and stands facing him.\n\nSARAH (archly): A queen? Have you chosen anyone I know.\n\nShe glides by him and walks to the window. JARETH chuckles\nappreciatively.\n\nJARETH: You've come a long way, little girl.\n\nSARAH looks out at the labyrinth.\n\nSARAH: I certainly have.\n\nShe turns to face him.\n\nJARETH: Yes, I can see it in your eyes. (he moves closer to her) No\none else has ever made it this far in the labyrinth, no one else has\never been worthy ...\n\nHe takes her hand and brings it to his lips. She smiles\ndown at him.\n\nSARAH: What's your offer.\n\nJARETH stands quickly and looks at her. She certainly has come a long\nway!\n\nJARETH: Why, everything ... you'll rule by my side.\n\nSARAH: Everything? The chance to spend my life surrounded by\nrepulsive goblins ... the chance to torment innocent creatures ...\n\nJARETH (shaking his head): ... the chance to never have a care in the\nworld, to never have to do anything that you don't want to do.\n\nSARAH looks at him.\n\nSARAH: Anything else?\n\nJARETH (smiling): Why, me. Of course.\n\nSARAH surreptitiously eyes the clock. There is about a minute left.\nShe glides away from the window and tries to position herself closer\nto FREDDIE.\n\nSARAH: And what if I'm not interested?\n\nJARETH reacts with surprise for a moment, then shakes his head.\n\nJARETH: Impossible. I know you, I know what you want ...\n\nSARAH: Well, I've got news for you, Jareth.\n\nShe makes a beeline for the cradle.\n\nSARAH: I don't want _you_!\n\nShe's almost at the cradle but JARETH grabs her arm and stops her.\n\nSARAH (shocked, enraged): Why, you miserable creep!\n\nJARETH has hold of her arms but she breaks away and hauls off and\npunches him in the jaw. JARETH steps back, stunned. SARAH scoops up\nthe screaming FREDDIE.\n\nSARAH: How could you do this to an innocent baby?!!\n\nJARETH stands rubbing his jaw, snivelling, stunned.\n\nJARETH: You hit me!\n\nSARAH, FREDDIE in her arms, goes right up to him.\n\nSARAH: And I'd like to do more ... you, you ... !\n\nShe is furious and wants to hit him again badly. Since she has the\nBABY in her arms she makes do with kicking him hard in the shin.\nJARETH howls and grabs his leg.\n\nSARAH: I wouldn't want you if you were the last ... _goblin_ on earth!\n\nThe WHITE BIRD flies through the window and lands on SARAH's\nshoulder. JARETH puts his hands on his ears.\n\nJARETH: Don't say that!\n\nBut it is too late, he starts shrinking.\n\nJARETH: Look at me! (whining) How could you do this to me!\n\nBefore SARAH's eyes JARETH turns into an undersized, ineffective,\nsnivelling little GOBLIN. The features are those of a goblin, but\nstill recognizably JARETH.\n\n86\tINT: CASTLE - NIGHT\n\nJARETH's quarters, where DIDYMUS tends HOGGLE and LUDO still blocks\nthe door.\n\nJARETH (VO) (whiney scream): Why does everything have to happen to me!\n\nThey look at each other and suddenly LUDO realizes that the GOBLINS\nare no longer trying to break down the door. The THREE start to laugh.\n\nHOGGLE (proudly): She did it!\n\nThey cheer.\n\n87\tINT: JARETH'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT\n\nJARETH, the bratty little GOBLIN, is throwing a tantrum.\n\nJARETH: Nobody ever cares about what I want!\n\nThe walls and floor shake so from his pounding fists and feet that a\ncrack opens up right in front of SARAH's feet. She looks at the clock\nand the minute hand moves to the 13. She looks at FREDDIE. There's\nnothing to do but jump into the void. The clock begins to strike.\n\nSARAH: OK, Freddie. Time to go bye-bye!\n\nShe jumps.\n\n88\tEXT: SKY - NIGHT\n\nSARAH and FREDDIE spinning through the dark, starry sky. The striking\nof the clock continues.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nCLOSE ON SARAH AND FREDDIE. SARAH pulls him closer, lovingly. And\nthey go on spinning.\n\n89\tINT: NURSERY - NIGHT\n\nSARAH is lying face down on the floor. She comes to slowly and tries\nto sit up. Groaning, she rubs her head where it bumped on the corner\nof the open drawer. She tries to focus, blinking her eyes.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH'S POV - Her eyes slowly focus on FREDDIE's crib. When she can\nsee, she gasps. FREDDIE's not there! The side of the crib is down and\nthe BABY is nowhere to be seen.\n\nSARAH: Freddie!\n\nShe leaps to her feet woozily. Still rubbing her head she staggers\nout into the hallway.\n\n90\tINT: RAILWAY - NIGHT\n\nSARAH looks down the hallway and suddenly her face breaks out into a\ndelighted grin.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH'S POV - LITTLE FREDDIE is crawling slowly, but determinedly,\ninto SARAH's room. When he gets to her bed he uses all his strength\nto pull himself up on to his feet by holding on to the bedspread. Be\nthen holds his hand out, trying to reach something.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nSARAH makes her way toward her room, delight and wonder on her face.\n\n91\tINT: SARAH'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nSARAH stands in the doorway looking down at FREDDIE.\n\nSARAH (softly): That's quite a journey you took, Freddie.\n\nFREDDIE looks up at her and makes a sound. He continues straining,\nand WE SEE that what he is reaching for is Lancelot, SARAH's bear.\nSARAH smiles, and lifts FREDDIE up. She sits on the bed, FREDDIE on\nher lap, and hands him the bear.\n\nSARAH: Here. It's yours.\n\nFREDDIE takes it happily.\n\nSARAH (smiling): You earned it.\n\nShe kisses his head and rocks him gently. Then she gazes out the\nwindow at the stars.\n\n92\tEXT: HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nThe light shines from SARAH's window. The WHITE BIRD flutters down\nfrom the starry sky. It perches in the tree beside the path.\n\nTHE END\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n\n\n\n\nLabyrinth\nWriters :   Dennis Lee  Jim Henson  Terry Jones  Elaine May\nGenres :   Family  Fantasy  Adventure  Musical\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n"

Suddenly, we\nhear a loud rumble, and see a thick, electronic mist behind\nthe planet... Then, the electronic mist begins to engulf the\nplanet, and we hear the horrible sounds of destruction.\nAlmost like somebody, or something, is eating it.\n\n                                                   PUSH DOWN TO:\n\nEXT. THE NEAR SIDE OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE\n\nStrange robotic creatures scramble around the planet in a\nwild panic. It looks like Pompeii must have looked as\nVesuvius erupted.\n\nANGLE ON ONE OF THE CREATURES - TRACKING\n\nThe creature is KRANIX. We will meet him later on in a very\ndifferent context, but for now, he is running from the ever-\ngrowing mist that threatens to engulf him.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE - THE PANIC\n\nAs Kranix runs, another creature, ARBLUS, calls to him.\n\n                       ARBLUS\n             Transform and flee, Kranix!

FOREST - NIGHT\n\n               Darkness. The sound of battle cries and the clang of metal \n               upon metal. The forest lights up with huge sparks flying \n               from sword and ax as armored knights hack and swing at each \n               other. Mounted knights collide head-on at full gallop, their \n               armor made incandescent in the clash. Sparks eddy in their \n               wakes and float to the ground. The forest catches fire.\n\n               MAIN TITLES on the flames. Out of the sounds of ancient battle \n               grows music, heroic and barbaric, shot through with \n               melancholy.\n\n               Two crazed eyes reflect the fire. The eyes belong to a man \n               without age, at once ancient and boyish, female and male; \n               his eyes are pained from the burden of too much knowledge. \n               So close is he to the flames that a lock of his wild hair \n               sizzles alight. He slaps at the fire as if it were an annoying \n               insect. He wears a cloak of black trimmed with silver. It is \n               Merlin. The wizard weaves a path through the burning forest, \n               dodging the combatants, searching.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Lord Uther! Lord Uther!\n\n               The forest around him weeps softly with the sounds that follow \n               slaughter. Patches of undergrowth are smoldering. Small flames \n               lick bark and branches.\n\n               Smoke floats through the trees and hovers over the bodies of \n               the dying and the dead.\n\n               A huge knight reins up beside Merlin on a lathered horse. \n               His armor is blood spattered. He is weary from battle. He \n               looks down at Merlin, his countenance fierce. The blade of \n               his sword glows with an unnatural aura.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         It's done. A truce.

RIVER, FOREST - DAY\n\n               Waiting on one bank of a small river that flows through the \n               forest is a warlord, the Duke of Cornwall. He is flanked by \n               his armored warriors. Lot of Lowthean prominent among them. \n               They are battle-weary and bloodied, but they look ready to \n               fight. Behind them is an army of lesser knights.\n\n               To the opposite bank come Uther and Merlin, a much smaller \n               force of knights, including Uryens, Lord of Gore, surrounding \n               them.\n\n                                     DUKE OF CORNWALL\n                         I spit on your truce, Uther. If you \n                         want peace, throw down your swords.\n\n               Uther and the Duke of Cornwall glare at each other in silence \n               across the river. Uther strains forward, burning with anger; \n               but Merlin restrains him.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         I should butcher all and every one \n                         of them.

The blade hums disquietingly and \n               leaves a lingering electric hue upon the air. The marvel \n               instills dread in all present.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                              (waxing eloquent)\n                         Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. \n                         Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, \n                         before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf \n                         to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to \n                         Thor himself and that was when the \n                         world was young and there were more \n                         than seven colors in the rainbow.\n                              (and in an aside to \n                              Uther)\n                         Speak the words.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                              (bellowing)\n                         One land, one king! That is my peace!\n\n               The Duke of Cornwall looks around nervously as some of his \n               knights fall to their knees in awe.\n\n                                     DUKE OF CORNWALL\n                         Lord Uther, if I yield to the sword \n                         of power, what will you yield?\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         Me, yield!?\n\n               Merlin urges Uther hard.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                              (a whisper)\n                         He has given.

TINTAGEL CASTLE - HALL - NIGHT\n\n               Drums and wailing flutes fill the banquet hall with a lusty \n               rhythm. Armored warriors watch a lone woman dancing. She is \n               very beautiful, both sensuous and innocent.\n\n               Uther sits at the long table beside the Duke of Cornwall \n               with the barons and dukes of the land, and the lesser knights. \n               The table is stained with wine and littered with bones and \n               half-eaten fruit.\n\n               Uther's eyes burn with lust as he watches the dancer.\n\n                                     DUKE OF CORNWALL\n                         I would wish you such a wife, Lord \n                         Uther, as my Igrayne. So innocent, \n                         but in bed, a furnace...\n\n               The Duke rises and goes to his wife, be-striding the center \n               of the hall and Igrayne weaves circles of dance around him. \n               He gloats with pride.\n\n               The words escape his lips:\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         I must have her.\n\n               Lot spins to face him.\n\n                                     LOT\n                         What?

This castle \n                         commands the sea gate to the kingdom.\n\n               Uther is not one for politics, and Lot's words sail past \n               him. The King lusts for Igrayne.\n\n               A bell is struck not far away. The music ceases and the hall \n               falls silent. The great door creaks open, revealing the dawn \n               light, and a monk steps into the hall and waits by it. Muffled \n               by corridors of stone, a choir of monks can now be heard \n               singing the high, ecstatic harmonies of the Te Deum. Those \n               who have fallen asleep at the table are roused, those drunk, \n               helped up.\n\n               INT. PASSAGEWAY, TINTAGEL CASTLE - DAWN\n\n               The monk leads the party down the hallway of the castle. \n               Thin shafts of dawnlight filter through archers' slits in \n               the thick walls onto stone floors. Otherwise, it is dark. \n               Each person, lady and knight, proceeds alone, head bent, \n               some crossing themselves.\n\n               Uther is among them. He stops in a dark alcove, breathing \n               heavily, waiting.\n\n               As the lovely Igrayne drifts past him, he pulls her out of \n               sight of the others.\n\n               In a shaft of pale light Uther clasps Igrayne to his \n               breastplate, his iron arm wrapped around her frail body. So \n               violent is his embrace that she cannot breathe, her mouth is \n               wide with fear, and her feet do not touch the ground; an \n               impaled butterfly.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         You will be mine. Wife and queen, \n                         bed and crown.\n\n               His face is close to hers, looking as though he would devour \n               her tender whiteness with his kiss. She doesn't answer; she \n               can't. Even Uther understands this and lets her go.\n\n                                     IGRAYNE\n                              (a fierce whisper)\n                         I want no other crown and no other \n                         bed than those I have.\n\n               Her gown and her fragile skin torn on the spikes of his armor, \n               Igrayne backs away and joins the procession.\n\n               Uther trembles with unreleased passion.\n\n               INT. PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE CHAPEL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - DAWN\n\n               Igrayne enters the candlelit chapel from which issues the \n               chant, calling the castle to worship. She rushes to her \n               husband's side, kneeling next to him and whispering. The \n               Duke of Cornwall looks back at Uther, hatred in his eyes.\n\n               EXT. WAR CAMP - BEFORE TINTAGEL CASTLE - DAY\n\n               Uther is in a towering rage. Sword drawn, he stalks among \n               the biers of fallen knights. Squires and clerics keep a \n               healthy distance. The sky is lowering, pregnant with rolling \n               thunder. Beyond his encampment, high on a cliff rising out \n               of the sea stands the impregnable Tintagel Castle, seat of \n               the Duke of Cornwall, now under siege.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                              (bellowing in all \n                              directions)\n                         Merlin! Where are you!?\n\n               Just then a knight rides up and dismounts.

He is taken aback by the sudden \n               appearance of a hideous hag who approaches, rattling a \n               beggar's pan.\n\n                                     HAG\n                         What a hurry you were in this morning, \n                         good sir.

BATTLEMENTS, TINTAGEL CASTLE - EVENING\n\n               The Duke of Cornwall watches a force of armored knights riding \n               forth from Uther's war camp, with banners flying. It passes \n               beneath the castle and on toward a distant cliff.\n\n                                     DUKE OF CORNWALL\n                              (to a lieutenant)\n                         It's Uther and all his best knights. \n                         He leaves behind little more than \n                         fledglings to guard his camp.\n\n               His eyes are as cold and as pale as ice.\n\n               EXT. CLIFF ABOVE THE SEA - TWILIGHT\n\n               Uther and his knights, and Merlin on a mule, ride to the \n               high promontory and dismount. Here, overlooking the sea, is \n               a circle of ancient stones, carved with strange runes and \n               hieroglyphics, and as the wind moves through them it moans \n               and sighs.\n\n               The knights watch as Merlin and Uther, leading his horse, \n               walk toward the stones. Merlin strides into the circle, \n               turning to look at Uther, who hesitates.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Come.\n\n               Uther starts to make the sign of the cross, but Merlin halts \n               him with a gesture. Uther's hand drops, and he enters the \n               circle with his horse.\n\n               Merlin and Uther look out across the sea, to Tintagel Castle \n               high upon the cliff.\n\n               Merlin solemnly raises his arms toward that distant castle, \n               and chants in an ancient language, the sounds of which he \n               marries to the roaring and whining of the wind. The wind \n               becomes stronger, and Merlin's incantations become more \n               intense, and the wind in turn becomes wilder still. Until \n               Merlin is charged with a fierce, nonhuman power, as the wind \n               buffets his slight frame.\n\n               And then, for all to understand:\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         I hold the balance of all things in \n                         my summoning. Arise mists. Come fog.\n\n               EXT. VISTA FROM THE CLIFF - TINTAGLE CASTLE - TWILIGHT\n\n               From the horizon a front of fog advances toward the castle \n               to envelop it, and continues across the gulf to the circle \n               of stones.\n\n               EXT. GATE, TINTAGLE CASTLE - TWILIGHT\n\n               The portal opens and a small force of armored men, led by \n               the Duke of Cornwall, exits. A fog is thickening all around \n               them.\n\n               EXT. CLIFF ABOVE THE SEA - TWILIGHT\n\n               The advancing front envelops Merlin and Uther, eddying around \n               the stones.  All else is obliterated.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Mount your horse.\n\n               The King does.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Ride straight to the castle, across \n                         the sea of fog.\n\n               Uther spurs straight for the edge of the cliff, then reins \n               in his horse abruptly.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         But the cliff, the sea...\n\n               Merlin rages, crazed.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Ride across! Across the bridges of \n                         desire. Your lust will hold you up. \n                         For I have just woven it into the \n                         fabric of the world. This is magic - \n                         making solid what is in the mind, \n                         and unsolid, that which is already \n                         solid.\n\n               He gives the horse a stinging blow with his staff.\n\n               The horse and Uther charge forward into a gallop and stepping \n               off where the hidden edge of the cliff would be, hoofbeats \n               ceasing and the horse dropping for the blink of an eye, they \n               gallop across the fog.\n\n               EXT. MERLIN'S FOG\n\n               Galloping on no visible terrain, Uther and his horse advance \n               through the restless fog, and as they recede rider and animal \n               become a wavering, changeable form within the cloud.\n\n               EXT. GATE, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT\n\n               Horse and rider pull up at the gate.\n\n                                     RIDER\n                              (calling)\n                         Wake up in there. It is I.\n\n               If it was not for the electric blue hue burning in the eyes \n               of the man entering the castle, the same magic hue that \n               Excalibur left upon the air when wielded, the resemblance to \n               the Duke if Cornwall would be perfect.\n\n               After a moment the portal opens.\n\n               INT. INNER GATE, INTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT\n\n               He passes into an inner court, the portal closing behind. \n               Armed men emerge cautiously. Thinking that it is their Duke \n               they help him dismount.\n\n                                     'DUKE' OF CORNWALL\n                         Have the horse ready. I ride out \n                         before sunrise.\n\n               An inner gate opens and the 'Duke' goes through it.\n\n               EXT. UTHER'S WAR CAMP - NIGHT\n\n               The real Duke and his men ride through the fogbound camp, \n               cutting the ropes of the tents, stabbing the men trapped \n               beneath the canvas. When a frightened crow flies squawking \n               into the face of the Duke's horse, which rears. He is unhorsed \n               and falls, and impales himself on a tent stake.\n\n               Dying, the true Lord of Tintagel Castle rises and staggers \n               forward, blood pumping from him.\n\n               INT. CHAMBER, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT\n\n               A little girl of four awakens from a nightmare, a small lone \n               figure in her canopied bed. Her eyes are ice, like her \n               father's.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         Papa...

IGRAYNE'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT\n\n               The 'Duke' enters. The room is empty, but the door to \n               Morgana's room is open.\n\n               INT. MORGANA'S CHAMBER - NIGHT\n\n               The 'Duke' stands in the doorway. Igrayne herself is \n               surprised.\n\n                                     IGRAYNE\n                         Look, here is your father. It was \n                         just a dream, little one.\n\n                                     'DUKE' OF CORNWALL\n                         Come Igrayne.\n\n               Igrayne kisses Morgana, tucks her in and returns to her own \n               room, closing the door. The child doesn't know whether to \n               believe the truth of the dream or the waking truth.\n\n               INT. IGRAYNE'S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT\n\n               In full armor, the 'Duke' bears down on the naked Igrayne on \n               her marriage bed. She stares at him, wondering. But his eyes \n               are closed, and finally he carries her in his wild passion, \n               her white limbs tangling around the lustre of his armor.\n\n               EXT. CLIFF ABOVE THE SEA - NIGHT\n\n               And Merlin is jolted awake from deep within himself, coming \n               out of a trance.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         It is done. The future has found \n                         root in the present.\n\n               He lifts himself up on his staff. He stands in the midst of \n               the ancient stones, bristling with excitement. Uther's mighty \n               knights are asleep, a deep unnatural sleep, huddled together \n               and surrounded by their horses. And then Merlin swoons, \n               collapsing to the ground.\n\n               INT. HALL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - DAWN\n\n               His lieutenants deposit the Duke of Cornwall's bloodless \n               body upon the long table. His eyes are wide open, icy and \n               cunning even in death. The ladies of the castle support and \n               comfort the grief-stricken Igrayne as she approaches the \n               body of her husband. Morgana hangs onto her mother's gown.\n\n                                     IGRAYNE\n                         When did it happen?

He came to me, to his \n                         bed, last night.\n\n                                     LADY\n                         It was his spirit, yearning for you \n                         in his hour of death, that visited \n                         you.\n\n                                     IGRAYNE\n                         His spirit?\n\n               Pale with grief, Igrayne stares at her dead husband in \n               silence.\n\n               Then her hand drifts to her stomach. When she talks again, \n               undone and resolved, it is to all and herself:\n\n                                     IGRAYNE\n                         Tintagel Castle falls to Uther. But \n                         what shall become of me, and the \n                         child I bear?\n\n               Morgana shows no distress. She runs her baby hands across \n               her father's face and closes his eyes. The intensity that \n               was frozen in them is now added to her own pale and cunning \n               eyes.\n\n               EXT. CLIFF ABOVE THE SEA - DAY\n\n               Merlin has been propped up against one of the stones.

Tell me!\n\n               Merlin's eyes open but he sees nothing, and only a puzzling \n               squeal issues from him.\n\n               INT. IGRAYNE'S BEDCHAMBER, TINTAGEL CASTLE- EVENING\n\n               Morgana watches from a corner. The ladies of the castle \n               surround Igrayne who is giving birth.\n\n               Noisy crows alight on the windowsill. Only Morgana notices.\n\n               INT. PASSAGEWAY, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT\n\n               Uther strides to Igrayne's bedchamber, his warrior knights \n               following. He is dirty and his iron dress is blood-spattered.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                              (bellowing)\n                         Three horses died under me, so hard \n                         did I spur them here. Is it born? Is \n                         it alive?\n\n               INT. IGRAYNE'S BEDCHAMBER, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT\n\n               At his approach and entrance the ladies shrink back, and \n               Morgana edges closer to her mother, and seats herself on the \n               bed beside her. Ingrain holds her newborn baby in her arms, \n               the blood of birth still wet upon it.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         Out!\n\n               The ladies slip past him to the door, and he goes up to \n               Igrayne.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         What is it, lady?\n\n               Terrified of him, Igrayne faces him the best she can.\n\n                                     IGRAYNE\n                         A boy, sir. Rest yourself.\n\n               Uther waves away her words but does sit down on the bed, \n               exhausted. He notices Morgana, who stares at him.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         Send the girl away.\n\n                                     IGRAYNE\n                         She is just a child -\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         Out!\n\n               Igrayne draws the child to her and kisses her cheek.\n\n                                     IGRAYNE\n                              (whispering)\n                         Go now. Come back later.\n\n               The child leaves silently, hatred in her eyes.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         She watches me with her father's \n                         eyes.\n\n               He grasps the newborn baby with his iron hand, and pulls it \n               to himself. He looks upon it with wonder, with a gentleness \n               that is unexpected.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         Igrayne, is he mine, or -\n\n               He can't bring himself to say his name. She hesitates on the \n               edge of tears, worried for the infant lying in its iron \n               cradle.\n\n                                     IGRAYNE\n                         The night he died, a man loved me \n                         with great fierceness. He looked \n                         like my husband, spoke like, smelled \n                         like, felt like my own husband. But \n                         it was not he, for he was already \n                         dead. It wasn't his spirit, for this \n                         child, who was conceived that night, \n                         is flesh and blood. I know nothing \n                         more.\n\n               Uther draws a dagger. He lifts it.\n\n                                     IGRAYNE\n                         No--\n\n               But he uses it before Igrayne can move. He severs the leather \n               thongs that bind the iron breastplate to his chest. He casts \n               it to the floor. His chest is smooth and milk-white in \n               striking contrast to his creased, weathered face. And beaming, \n               he holds the baby to it.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         Through him, I will learn to love \n                         them, for I am tired of battle. I \n                         will stay by his side and\n                              (looking shyly at \n                              Igrayne)\n                         his mother's...\n\n               Igrayne's hatred for the man is at the very edge of becoming \n               love. The baby starts to cry.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         Here. It's hungry.\n\n               And his free hand opens her shift, and he holds a swollen \n               breast in his gloved hand, squeezing gently. Milk bubbles \n               from it and he thrusts the baby's mouth onto it.\n\n               Igrayne weeps and Uther watches proudly as the baby suckles.\n\n               Merlin advances from the window, his cape the same iridescent \n               green-black as the feathers of the crows that were perched \n               by the window.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         Merlin!

It takes it's toll. \n                         It took nine moons to get back my \n                         strength.\n\n               Uther avoids looking at him.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Now you must pay me.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         I?\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         The child is mine, Uther. I have \n                         come for him.\n\n               Uther is shaken to his roots. Igrayne watches, trying to \n               understand.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         The oath.

Don't let him \n                         take the child.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         I swore an oath, Igrayne. I made a \n                         pact with Merlin.\n\n               Igrayne suddenly understands. She glares at Uther.\n\n                                     IGRAYNE\n                         It was you?

I thought \n                         once that you were the one to unite \n                         the land under one sword. But it'll \n                         take another, a greater king...\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         You strike me with words as hard as \n                         steel.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         They are not weapons, my friend, but \n                         truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole \n                         his wife and took his castle, now no \n                         one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your \n                         allies will turn against you. Give \n                         me the child, Uther, I will protect \n                         him. Go back to your war tent.\n\n               Uther wrenches the baby from it's mother's breast and hands \n               him to Merlin.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                              (in torment)\n                         By the oath, take the devil child. \n                         Take him!\n\n               With the bawling baby under his cape, Merlin exits. Igrayne \n               pulls herself out of the bed, weak, her legs giving under \n               her. She starts after Merlin.\n\n                                     IGRAYNE\n                         WHY?... Why must he have the baby?\n\n               Uther stops her with his bulk and she claws savagely at his \n               chest to get past him. He weeps as he folds his arms around \n               her.\n\n               INT. PASSAGEWAY, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT\n\n               As Merlin walks through the castle, the baby crying in his \n               arms, the knights and ladies step back, afraid to intervene \n               in royal matters.\n\n               INT. HALL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT.\n\n               Merlin comes across the empty banquet hall, cooing to the \n               baby, strangely pacifying him. Morgana steps out of the \n               shadows in his path, and Merlin stops at the sight of the \n               little girl, her pale eyes glaring at him.\n\n               She speaks haltingly and clearly while far-off Igrayne cries \n               out her distress.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         Merlin, are you now the father, and \n                         the mother, of the baby?\n\n               Staring at her, Merlin shudders and without answering he \n               continues away, faster now, and into an unlit passageway, \n               disappearing from sight a bit sooner than an ordinary mortal \n               would have.\n\n               EXT. FOREST - DAY\n\n               The forest is dark and shiny with rain. An unseen battle \n               rages.\n\n               The first combatant in sight is Uther, who swings the mighty \n               Excalibur, cutting an attacker in half at the waist. Uther \n               and a small force of knights, Ulfius among them, are \n               retreating through the slippery wet forest, completely \n               outnumbered.\n\n               Lord Lot of Lowthean and Lord Uryens of Gore are the leaders \n               of the attack.\n\n                                     URYENS\n                              (to his men)\n                         The King's sword. I must have it.\n\n               Ulfius and his men stand their ground so the King may escape \n               the onslaught. They are hacked down.\n\n               Uther flees alone, severing the limbs of any man and tree \n               that stands in his way.\n\n               EXT. STONE IN THE FOREST - DAY\n\n               Uther has gained on his pursuers. He comes to a small clearing \n               where the spine of a buried boulder rises through the forest \n               floor. He stops upon it, breathing hard, dripping blood. He \n               rages aloud, but his throat is raw and cracked and only a \n               whisper comes out.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         Merlin, where are you? To weave a \n                         mist, to hide us...\n\n               He hears his pursuers closing in.\n\n                                     UTHER\n                         No one shall have the sword. No one \n                         shall wield Excalibur but me.\n\n               He holds it by the hilt with both hands, the blade pointing \n               to the ground of stone. He flexes his knees. He lifts up his \n               hands above his head. And with all the strength that rage \n               and pain can muster, and more, he drives the blade of \n               Excalibur into the stone, nearly to the hilt. His mouth widens \n               in an awful silent scream, and then the foam of saliva pink \n               with blood issues from deep within him, so violent was his \n               effort.\n\n               As the sword cuts into the rock, the earth shudders.\n\n               EXT. FOREST - DAY\n\n               The forest quakes. The knights searching for Uther halt in \n               fear.\n\n               EXT. FIELDS, WOODS - DAY\n\n               And far away, a caped figure is crossing a field toward a \n               wood, when the earth shakes, stirring animals and birds. The \n               man turns. He is Merlin, the two day-old baby peeking from \n               his cape. Merlin is amazed at the phenomenon, he puts his \n               ear to a rock protruding from the earth.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Into the spine of the dragon!\n                              (and then he is \n                              saddened)\n                         Uther... I loved you, mighty child.\n\n               And tears welling, and giggling at the same time, he whisks \n               away into the woods.\n\n               EXT. STONE IN THE FOREST - DAY\n\n               Uther staggers away, colliding with trees, staggering, \n               crashing to the ground. Until the only life left in him is \n               the coursing of his blood, flowing from his gaping mouth \n               onto the leaves on the forest floor.\n\n               The enemy knights advance through the trees. They prod at \n               the fallen leviathan, they roll him over to get at his \n               scabbard. Only then do they see the sword in the stone, and \n               they stop, amazed and afraid. Their captains appear. Uryens \n               sees what they are staring at, and races to the sword and \n               attempts to pull it out.\n\n               He strains with all his might, but it is immovable.\n\n                                     LOT\n                         Let me.\n\n               He shoves Uryens aside, but he can't loosen the sword either, \n               and he rages with frustration.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               LEGEND APPEARS:\n\n               \"Fifteen years passed and the land was without a king.\"\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               EXT. FIELDS - DAY\n\n               Peasants spill over the crest of a hill. They are fleeing a \n               force of armored knights, their plumed helmets forged in the \n               semblance of predatory animals. The knights thunder past the \n               peasants, trampling the ripening crops. Sir Uryens is their \n               leader, his hard face indifferent to the havoc he leaves in \n               his wake.\n\n               The peasants watch in mute anger.\n\n               EXT. FARMYARD - EVENING\n\n               Sir Lot leading another group of mounted knights comes \n               galloping into a small hamlet, panicked chickens and pigs \n               scattering at their approach. The farmers run for their lives \n               as the steel men dismount, leading their horses to water and \n               hay, and searching for vittles. A knight spots a woman who \n               stands frozen with fear, and he drags her into the barn as \n               her crying child watches.\n\n               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT - MOONLIGHT\n\n               A farmhouse is burning nearby, and three mounted figures \n               make their way along a trail at a walking pace - an old knight \n               in leather and mail, a young knight proud in gleaming new \n               armor; and on a farm horse, a squire with baggage and jousting \n               lance. The old knight, Sir Ector, is troubled by what he \n               sees.\n\n                                     SIR ECTOR\n                         It is a dark hour... everywhere \n                         lawlessness and destruction, and no \n                         one to lead us out of it.\n\n               Just then, ten crazed peasants emerge from the darkness, \n               hurling stones and armed with clubs and pronged sticks. They \n               surround the three riders. Sir Ector wheels around and slices \n               the air with his sword to ward off the ambushers.\n\n                                     SIR ECTOR\n                         Listen all. I am Sir Ector of Morven \n                         and these are my sons. You would \n                         wrong me, for I have never stolen \n                         from others, or destroyed the fruit \n                         of the land.\n\n               The peasants edge closer, working up the nerve to rush the \n               horsemen. The sound of thundering hooves cuts through the \n               clamor.\n\n               A cavalcade of riders, armor gleaming in the moonlight, \n               advances across the fields at a gallop. Immediately the \n               peasants scatter. The old knight is on the verge of tears.\n\n                                     SIR ECTOR\n                         The people's anger is just. It is \n                         sad that for our own safety, we will \n                         have to ride to the tournament with \n                         these robber knights.\n\n               EXT. SITE OF THE SWORD IN THE STONE - SUNRISE\n\n               Red with the first light of day, Excalibur rests in the stone \n               as King Uther left it. The field is itched with tents, each \n               flying its heraldic banner. Knights and squires are \n               everywhere, preparing horses and armor for the joust. A burly \n               man in religious robes harangues the crowd, vying for \n               attention.\n\n                                     BISHOP\n                         This is Easter day, when Christ rose \n                         again. Who will find strength in \n                         victory of arms? Who will draw the \n                         sword?\n\n               The Bishop goes among the tents, through the teeming throng, \n               solemnly casting holy water upon man and horse, armor and \n               banner. The knights kneel at the Bishop's transit, but \n               ceremony does not lift the air of grimness that lies over \n               the event.\n\n               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND, SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY\n\n               Their armor ablaze with sunlight, two mounted knights thunder \n               toward each other at full gallop, lowering their long jousting \n               lances. As they meet, the lance of each knight is deflected \n               by the shield of the other. A gasp goes through the crowd, \n               and the two knights charge past each other. They wheel around \n               at the end of the jousting ground and go at each other again \n               from the other direction. Again lances strike, and this time \n               one of the men is hit in the chest and violently unhorsed. \n               The crowd cheers.\n\n               EXT. THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY\n\n               The victor, Leondegrance, rides up to the stone and dismounts. \n               Each great knight with his coterie of lesser knights comes \n               to watch. A charge of expectation is in the air, although \n               most knights are glowering with envy.\n\n               Leondegrance of Camelyarde ascends to the sword, grabs it by \n               the hilt, and begins to tug with all his might. Excalibur is \n               immovable. The moment of tension passes. Leondegrance staggers \n               toward his waiting squires, who lead him away. All the others \n               return to the battle sport.\n\n               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND - DAY\n\n               At the edge of the jousting ground Sir Ector's son Sir Kay \n               is getting ready for a bout. His brother Arthur is buckling \n               the new armor while his father fusses about him, making small \n               adjustments when he notices that Kay's scabbard is empty. He \n               turns to Arthur and grab's him by the ear.\n\n                                     SIR ECTOR\n                         Arthur, where is Kay's sword? A good \n                         squire doesn't forget his knight's \n                         sword.\n\n               The fifteen year-old boy blushes.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         I left it in the tent, sir.\n\n                                     SIR ECTOR\n                         Well hurry then, and get it.\n\n               The boy dashes off as Sir Ector shakes his head, not without \n               affection beneath the sternness.\n\n               EXT. TENTS - DAY\n\n               Arthur runs in search of their tent. He finds it.\n\n               INT. TENT - DAY\n\n               He enters. The saddle trunk has been emptied on the floor, \n               equipment is scattered all over. Arthur is shocked, \n               nonetheless he rummages madly. Finally he stops, on the verge \n               of tears.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         It's been stolen....\n\n               EXT. TENTS - DAY\n\n               He comes out, utterly defeated, and frantic. He stops by two \n               knights who are arguing angrily; and one of them has left \n               his sword in the grass.\n\n               Arthur looks at it. He is tempted to steal it, but he can't. \n               Head down, he wanders off.\n\n               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND - DAY\n\n               Sir Ector and Sir Kay are waiting.\n\n                                     SIR KAY\n                         Father, I'll go and see what's keeping \n                         him.\n\n               EXT. THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY\n\n               Arthur stops at the edge of the dark forest, totally dejected, \n               when he sees the sword in the stone. He walks up to it, his \n               face lighting up, brimming with innocence. He is alone, as \n               everyone has returned to the jousting ground.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         If only Kay could have it...\n\n               He smiles, forgetting his troubles, a boy again living in a \n               fairy tale. He grasps the sword by the hilt and it comes \n               away easily from its stone lock.\n\n               Not expecting it to, he nearly falls. He stares at it, \n               terribly excited and surprised: he tucks it under his arm \n               and rushes back.\n\n               EXT. TENTS - DAY\n\n               He bumps into Kay.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                              (breathless)\n                         Your sword was stolen, Kay, but here \n                         is Excalibur. Is it too late? I \n                         hurried--\n\n               Kay takes it. He cannot believe what he's holding in his \n               hands. He starts to talk but he is so agitated he can only \n               stutter.\n\n               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND - DAY\n\n               Kay, with Arthur in tow, rushes to Sir Ector and shows him \n               the sword; he trembles with excitement.\n\n                                     SIR KAY\n                         Look, Father. Excalibur. Does that \n                         mean that I am to be king?\n\n               Sir Ector is dumbstruck.\n\n                                     SIR ECTOR\n                         Did you free the sword, boy?\n\n                                     SIR KAY\n                         I... did, Father.\n\n               Ector looks at his son amazed, wanting to believe but not \n               able to.\n\n                                     SIR ECTOR\n                         We must go to the stone at once.\n\n               With Excalibur in hand Ector of Morven heads for the stone, \n               Kay following, and Arthur too, the boy flushed with excitement \n               but a little worried, not understanding what is happening.\n\n               The exchange between Sir Ector and Sir Kay has been overheard. \n               Some have seen the sword in Sir Ector's hand. Rumor spreads \n               like wildfire.\n\n               EXT. THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY\n\n               As Sir Ector ascends the stone, from all parts of the jousting \n               ground knights and squires, the Bishop and the clerics, and \n               peasants too, press around.\n\n               Ector lowers the blade into the tight cleft and Excalibur \n               sinks to its original position.\n\n                                     SIR ECTOR\n                         Draw it, son!\n\n               Sir Kay grabs the hilt and pulls without conviction, and the \n               sword doesn't give. Eyes downcast, he lets go.\n\n                                     SIR KAY\n                         Sir, I didn't draw the sword. Arthur \n                         gave it to me.\n\n                                     SIR ECTOR\n                         Arthur ?!\n                              (spinning around to \n                              face him)\n                         How did you get the sword, child?\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                              (frightened)\n                         Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was \n                         stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I \n                         took it.\n\n                                     SIR ECTOR\n                         You freed it, son?\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness.\n\n               He starts to kneel but Ector pulls him up.\n\n                                     SIR ECTOR\n                         Try the sword, Arthur.\n\n               Arthur is about to grasp the hilt when Uryens and Lot, and \n               other nobles, Leondegrance of Camelyarde, and Sir Caradoc \n               and Sir Turquine among the younger, stride up.\n\n                                     URYENS\n                         Stand back, Sir Ector, and take your \n                         children.\n\n                                     LOT\n                         We will try again.\n\n               Uryens, Lot, Leondegrance, Caradoc, Turquine - each in turn \n               grapples with the sword, only to be defeated by its \n               immobility. The crowd around the stone is thickening with \n               common folk.\n\n                                     SIR ECTOR\n                         Let the boy try the sword.\n\n                                     BISHOP\n                         Let the boy try...\n\n               The demand is echoed by peasants and serfs. The great knights \n               remain silent and bitter in their defeat. Sir Ector pushes \n               Arthur to the sword.\n\n                                     SIR ECTOR\n                         Go ahead, boy. Don't be afraid.\n\n               The boy hesitates shyly, and then takes the hilt of Excalibur \n               and pulls out the sword with a great sweep.\n\n               The throng is stunned. Silence falls. Some kneel, following \n               the example of Sir Ector and Sir Kay, of the Bishop and \n               Leondegrance. The other nobles stay back, confused, afraid, \n               angered.\n\n               Arthur stands there, little more than a boy, his cheeks \n               flushed, his soft hair ruffled by the wind, his eyes shining \n               with exultation, awe, and fear. Then, as if gaining confidence \n               from the sword itself, he turns it in arcs above his head.\n\n                                     BISHOP\n                         We have our King, thanks be to God.\n\n               The commoners and some of the knights react with roaring \n               enthusiasm. The others draw closer to Uryens and Lot and \n               their supporters, closing ranks around them.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Please, Father, rise up.

A crow is \n               perched on his shoulder, and it squawks loudly.

They \n               dare to press up against them, fists hammering on their \n               shields as the chant Arthur King over and over. Dark and \n               scowling, full of rebellion, all the lords except Leondegrance \n               begin to withdraw their iron men surrounding them.\n\n               EXT.

He extends his arms halfway \n               up, his fists clenched tightly as if drawing urgently on the \n               power within himself. The sound of wings is heard as he flaps \n               his arms.\n\n               The arrow flies toward Arthur.\n\n               Arthur sees the arrow coming right at him, when a swooping \n               crow plucks it out of the air.\n\n               Arthur watches the crow flapping its wings, climbing swiftly, \n               the arrow in its beak, disappearing over the forest. Only he \n               has noticed.\n\n               When he turns Merlin is no longer at his side; to the \n               puzzlement of all.

Their \n               shields glinting in the moonlight are the dragon's scales, \n               torches its burning eyes.

Lot's and \n               Uryens' people are pushed into the moat. Although the water \n               is only waist-deep, the fallen, weighed down by their armor, \n               drown. The horses of the attackers are brought down, Arthur's \n               among them. He pulls out from under it, limping.

Arthur \n               steps forward alone, and addresses his opponents.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         You are in my hands, to slay or spare. \n                         I need battle lords such as you. \n                         Swear faith to me and you shall have \n                         mercy.\n\n                                     URYENS\n                         Noble knights swear faith to a mere \n                         squire?\n\n               Arthur turns, searching for Merlin.

A \n               serving platter bearing roast rabbit in rampant position is \n               carried across the hall. It is laid on the long raised table \n               before Arthur, who presides in the middle.

She slaps her \n               hands, and a servant sets down a tray of pastries before \n               Arthur.\n\n                                     GUENEVERE\n                         They are only for you, for in them I \n                         mixed things that heal, but not too \n                         quickly; and things that make limbs \n                         sleepy, preventing escape, but keep \n                         one's mind sharp.\n\n               She smiles at Arthur's embarrassment and confusion.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         What's in them?\n\n               She takes a cake and bites into it.\n\n                                     GUENEVERE\n                         It is an ancient mixture, containing \n                         only soft, unborn grains, and flavored \n                         with roses. The rest is secret.\n\n               Guenevere offers one to Arthur, and he hesitates, looking at \n               it.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Looking at the cake is like looking \n                         at the future.

And then, of course, \n                         it will he too late.\n\n               Arthur bites into the cake, and Guenevere looks deep into \n               his eyes.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Too late...\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               A LEGEND APPEARS:\n\n               \"...but for years war kept Arthur from thoughts of marriage.\"\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               EXT. OAK FOREST - DAY\n\n               War tents have been pitched beneath the majestic trees. Near \n               the banner of the Dragon a doe grazes. Arthur is older, in \n               battle-scarred plate armor, pacing and angry. He is watched \n               by his wounded and bruised knights--Kay, Uryens, Lot, \n               Leondegrance, Caradoc, and some new young faces among the \n               ranks. No one talks.\n\n               The harsh clank of its battle trappings announces the arrival \n               of a horse. All eyes watch it walk into the camp. A knight \n               is slouched in the saddle.\n\n               Arthur runs to meet the horse, followed by squires and some \n               of the knights.\n\n               He eases the rider to the ground, unlaces his helmet. It is \n               Sir Ector, and his hauberk is badly dented. Tears burn in \n               Arthur's eyes.\n\n                                     SIR ECTOR\n                         He is the mightiest and fairest of \n                         knights.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         We fought and won battles, and now \n                         one man defeats all my knights? I \n                         will go.\n\n               He pushes past the knights and goes to his horse. Kay steps \n               in front of him.\n\n                                     SIR KAY\n                         A king must not engage in single \n                         contest.

His \n               knights are afraid for him.\n\n               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY\n\n               His countenance grim, Arthur gallops along a trail bordering \n               a plowed field when in it a scarecrow moves. It starts to \n               run as stick-wielding farmers pursue it. It is Merlin. Arthur \n               turns off into the field, and at the sight of an armored \n               knight on a war horse, the farmers turn and flee. Merlin \n               stops to catch his breath.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                              (angry)\n                         I should have left you to fend for \n                         yourself.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         I had to weave a little enchantment \n                         on the bees so I could get some honey, \n                         and I didn't feel up to using any \n                         more magic just yet. Anyway, I was \n                         in less danger than you'll be in \n                         today.\n\n               Arthur's hand is clenched tight around Excalibur's hilt.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         So you were stealing their honey. \n                         They should have killed you.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Come now.

Come witness my \n                         revenge.\n\n               He offers his arm and Merlin hoists himself up behind the \n               King.\n\n               EXT. GORGE THROUGH THE HILLS - DAY\n\n               A waterfall cascades into a pool. The spray casts a rainbow. \n               Beneath it is a colorful confusion of flowers and budding \n               trees, a place dreamlike in its beauty.\n\n               Arthur, with Merlin behind, gallops along the edge of the \n               pool. The trail widens into a field of grass. Arthur reins \n               beside a pile of broken lances and twisted shields. Across \n               the field, pitched upon the trail is a war tent made of \n               diaphanous white silk, a sky blue banner above it. Merlin \n               slides off and Arthur continues.\n\n               From the tent, a knight with jousting lance rides forward to \n               meet him. His armor is so shiny it is a mirror. His eyes, \n               seen through the open visor, seem to laugh. His speech is \n               foreign, from across the sea. He is Lancelot of the Lake.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         Good day to you, sir.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Move aside.

I am the best knight \n                         in the whole of Christiandom, and I \n                         look for the king who is worthy of \n                         my sword's service.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         --That is a wild boast.

You must retreat or prove \n                         your kingship in the test of arms, \n                         under the eyes of God.\n\n               He crosses himself.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Then may He give me the strength to \n                         unhorse you and send you with one \n                         blow back across the sea.\n\n               Arthur wheels away, trembling with anger, and gallops to his \n               edge of the field. He sees that Lancelot has already \n               positioned himself and is waiting, lance down.\n\n               Merlin watches, a spectator, as the two charge at each other. \n               They collide with great force, their spears shattering. Arthur \n               is jolted but stays in the saddle. Lancelot's jousting is \n               impeccable. Arthur draws Excalibur.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         Hold! I offer you another lance.\n\n               Pages come forward with new lances for Arthur and Lancelot.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         You joust well, sir. Battle learnt, \n                         but tournament fancy. You should \n                         ride more forward in the saddle, \n                         though.\n\n               Arthur grabs the spear from the page's hands, and circles \n               back to work the horse up into an all-out gallop. Lancelot \n               spurs forward to meet him. Arthur is neatly unhorsed. He \n               picks himself up from the ground in a rage, drawing Excalibur. \n               Lancelot on his horse weaves circles around him.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         Yield. I have the advantage.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         I will not.\n\n               Arthur charges Lancelot, a raging bull, but cuts and slashes \n               only at the air as Lancelot stays clear of him.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Fight me from your horse or on foot, \n                         but fight me.

Shield and \n               sword and armor against shield and sword and armor. The \n               swordplay is furious, Arthur attacking, slashing, hacking, \n               Lancelot parrying effortlessly, elegantly defensive. Arthur \n               breaks the onslaught to catch his breath. Lancelot lifts his \n               visor. His eyes are calm, laughing.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. \n                         It seems you would fight to the death \n                         against a knight who is not your \n                         enemy, for a length of road you can \n                         ride around.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         So be it, to the death.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         It is you, sir, who knows not the \n                         virtue of humility, as a true king \n                         must.\n\n               Arthur goes forward attacking with terrible blows upon \n               Lancelot's shield, and Lancelot holds his ground, shield \n               high. And in its mirror-like metal Arthur can see his own \n               reflection, a face distorted by uncontrolled passion.\n\n               Arthur discards his own shield, grabs Excalibur with both \n               hands, and with a frightening shout that speaks of all his \n               rage, he swings a terrific blow upon the shield, cutting \n               through his own reflection and the metal. And Excalibur snaps \n               in two.\n\n               A blinding blue-green light explodes from the broken sword. \n               Lancelot, knocked back by the force of the blow, is stunned \n               by the blast and falls to the ground unconscious. Arthur \n               backs away, horrified, half of Excalibur in his hand.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         What horror is this?\n                              (calling)\n                         Merlin!\n\n               Merlin approaches, pale, gripped by dread.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         The sword is broken.

He kneels at the waters edge, and he cries.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         I am nothing.\n\n               Then Arthur sees something that startles him. Beneath the \n               surface, suspended in the blue-green water amid the dancing \n               weeds, he sees Excalibur, intact.\n\n               It is held by a maiden in flowing gown the color of water, \n               her long hair rippling across her face, obscuring it.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Excalibur!

Take \n                         it, quickly!\n\n               Arthur dips his hand under the water and grasps the hilt and \n               the moment he does the vision in the blue-green water fades. \n               He rises with Excalibur in hand, and Merlin speaks before \n               Arthur can ask the question.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         There are infinite worlds within the \n                         infinite coils of the Dragon.

Arthur rushes to his side. He \n               loosens his helmet and removes it, uncovering damp curls. \n               The young knight's eyes open, and his laughing charm once \n               more animates his face.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Thanks to God, you are alive.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                              (sitting up)\n                         I, the best knight in the world, \n                         bested!

ARTHUR'S WAR CAMP - NIGHT\n\n               Converging from different directions parties of mounted \n               knights enter the war camp. Lancelot among them. They \n               dismount, battle-weary and burning with the excitement of \n               victory. They quench their huge thirst from buckets carried \n               by squires. They rip off hunks of meat from carcasses sizzling \n               on spits over a roaring fire. And they join the throng of \n               knights, where stories of deeds of arms of the day are \n               enthusiastically exchanged.\n\n               A great number of knights are packed tightly around King \n               Arthur, each man anxious to tell of his victories. One of \n               them has the King's attention.\n\n                                     KNIGHT\n                         ...We killed every one of them.

The only unarmored man in the \n               crowd, he glares at the excited knights irritably.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Lancelot, how did you fare in the \n                         North?\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         We spared the lives of a few, so \n                         they could sail home and tell their \n                         fellows what fate they met at the \n                         hands of King Arthur's knights...\n\n               Arthur turns toward Uryens.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         And you, Uryens?\n\n                                     URYENS\n                         Victory!\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Lot, and you?\n\n                                     LOT\n                         We drove the invaders into the sea.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         You, Gawain, the East?\n\n                                     GAWAIN\n                         The East is ours again.\n\n               Cheers greet each declaration.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         The war is over. One land, one King. \n                         Peace.\n\n               Amidst the celebration, a fracas is heard. A knight pushing \n               forward to talk to Arthur has entered a shoving match with \n               those in front of him.\n\n                                     KNIGHT\n                         Let me through. I fought the King's \n                         battle too. He must know my story.\n\n               Merlin is brutally jostled. He draws a fistful of powder \n               from his cape and he tosses it into the air above him. He \n               raises his staff into the cloud, cracking it like a whip. \n               The tip of the staff catches fire, and the fire spreads \n               through the powder in the air, stunning all into silence. \n               Merlin shouts and snarls.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Chaos... confusion... brutes... \n                         savages... troglodytes... Stand \n                         back... make space.\n\n               Merlin swings his burning staff into a wide arc. The knights \n               back away, amused at first, then a bit afraid.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         The moon... the sun... the stars... \n                         they spin... they turn... they \n                         circle... around us... us...\n\n               The knights have fallen back. Merlin stalks past each man, \n               and Arthur too, holding the flaming tip of his staff before \n               each pair of eyes, and staring into them with his gimlet \n               gaze.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         You, and you, and you, take up your \n                         place.

They realize this. \n               Awestruck, they whisper in astonishment, looking up at the \n               sky burning with stars. Merlin brims with pride as he waits \n               for Arthur to recognize his handiwork.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Your ancient wisdom and infinite \n                         sight have forged this circle, Merlin. \n                         Hereafter we shall come together in \n                         a circle, to tell and hear of deeds \n                         good and brave.

And a \n                         castle about the hall.\n\n               A cheer rises. Arthur strides into the ring of knights.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         And I will marry.\n\n               Another bout of cheers goes up, and Arthur stops before \n               Leondegrance, resting his hand on the old knight's shoulder.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         And the land will have an heir to \n                         wield Excalibur.\n\n               Leondegrance's eyes fill with tears of joy. A roar of cheers. \n               Arthur draws the sword of power.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Knights of the Round Table, good \n                         friends, brothers in arms.

He unsheathes \n               his sword and swoops it low in salute.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         I swear never to rest twice on the \n                         same pillow till all men live at \n                         peace.\n\n               In quick succession all knights draw their swords, following \n               Lancelot's example.\n\n               Merlin struggles to put out the flame on his staff. He finally \n               does it by smothering it with earth. When he looks up again, \n               he sees the knights galloping off in all directions.\n\n               INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY\n\n               Terrified women, a screaming child, cowering men, old or \n               made old by the hard labor of the fields. Armored men are \n               ransacking a farm, looking for grain, and gold which they \n               find among the votive objects of a little house altar. A \n               woman is dragged away to be raped.\n\n               Through a window, a knight in shining armor is seen emerging \n               from the adjoining woods. The plunderers are all of a sudden \n               apprehensive, and fall silent. One of them grabs the crying \n               child and covers her mouth with his iron hand.\n\n               EXT. FARMYARD - DAY\n\n               The knight is Lancelot, in his mirror-like armor. He rides \n               into the cluster of houses and barns that make up the farm. \n               There are other armored men there, around a cart half-loaded \n               with loot. They smile nervously at Lancelot. The farmers are \n               blank with fear.\n\n               Lancelot stops in the middle of the yard. A knight among the \n               armored men comes forward.\n\n                                     KNIGHT\n                         Good day, sir.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         Good day to you.\n\n               And he also acknowledges with a nod the ashen-faced patriarch \n               of the community.\n\n               Lancelot spurs his horse on, and the knight sighs with relief. \n               But then he reins his horse to a stop. He has sensed \n               something. He turns his head, his hooded eyes on the knight \n               and his men, and they squirm inwardly.\n\n               INT.

He reins in his horse, causing it to rear and \n               break their attack. He slides off, falling on his feet with \n               sword drawn, already fighting. In an extraordinary show of \n               sword play he cuts down six men.\n\n               INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY\n\n               Hearing Lancelot storm in, the man holding the child hands \n               her to a woman and kneels before the altar, just as Lancelot \n               bursts into the room, sword high and already swooping down \n               on the man's neck. Lancelot brings the sword to a halt mid-\n               air, his fury held in check. The repent man is spared. The \n               woman kneels to kiss Lancelot's hand.\n\n               EXT. SITE OF THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY\n\n               The field is pitched with war tents and pavilions decked for \n               holiday. Nobles and knights flank the King and Guenevere, a \n               beautiful vision in white samite, a wreath of flowers around \n               her head. Lancelot leads a long file of prisoners to the \n               King. They fall to their knees, begging forgiveness; among \n               them is the man whom Lancelot had spared before the altar.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         These men repented before God for \n                         their evil deeds. Those who would \n                         not, met their fate at the end of my \n                         sword.\n                              (he kneels)\n                         Accept the fruit of my first quest \n                         as my wedding gift.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me.\n\n               He rises and follows Arthur and Guenevere into the central \n               pavilion. Pages draw its curtains closed as they pass inside.\n\n               INT. PAVILION - DAY\n\n               Guenevere is surrounded by a group of ladies and maids who \n               fuss over her dress and her hair. They eye the great knight \n               and whisper about him, Guenevere laughing with them.\n\n               Arthur sits, excited and happy.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Sit beside me, Lancelot.\n\n               Lancelot sits, stiff and upright.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Your deeds set an example for all \n                         other knights.

She approaches and Lancelot jumps to \n               his feet.\n\n                                     GUENEVERE\n                              (to Arthur)\n                         He must stay for the feasting days \n                         of our wedding, and tell his deeds \n                         himself.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                              (to Lancelot, smiling)\n                         I grant you your wish if you grant \n                         Lady Guenevere hers.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         I will stay Madame.\n\n               Merlin leans close to Arthur.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         The knights of Galys approach the \n                         camp.

She \n               looks at him, lively and amused, and he can't help smiling.\n\n                                     GUENEVERE\n                         Look Lancelot. The maids and ladies \n                         whisper about you. They all dream of \n                         winning you, young and old, fair and \n                         ugly.\n\n               Lancelot blushes.\n\n                                     GUENEVERE\n                         But surely that's no secret to you, \n                         dear Lancelot. You're the bravest \n                         and strongest knight they've ever \n                         seen, and beauty has kissed your \n                         brow.\n\n               He can't look at her.\n\n                                     GUENEVERE\n                         The well-kept secret is whether any \n                         of them has won your heart.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         No.\n\n                                     GUENEVERE\n                         Why?\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         I am a fighting man and I am married \n                         to the quest.

And, in pledging my love to \n                         you, I cannot love any other woman.\n\n               Guenevere smiles, moved by his blunt innocence.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         I will see you in all women, and I \n                         will defend them as I would defend \n                         you.\n\n               He kneels, kisses her thigh, rises and leaves.\n\n               INT. CHAPEL - DAY\n\n               A chorus of children sings. The Bishop waits at the altar \n               with his friars and altar boys. Cornucopias overflowing with \n               vegetables and wildflowers adorn the church, which glows \n               with the light of a thousand candles. Sir Kay is satisfied. \n               He comes back up the petal-strewn aisle.\n\n               EXT. CHAPEL, SITE OF THE SWORD IN THE STONE - DAY\n\n               Arthur and Guenevere are ushered in by Kay. They are flanked \n               by Leondegrance and Sir Ector. Lancelot and Merlin follow, \n               leading the cortege of knights and ladies.\n\n               Merlin is incapable of entering the chapel, as if at the \n               threshold there is an unseen force that repels him.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         Lord Merlin, are you ill?\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         No, no, I need air.\n\n               Strangling a laugh he wrenches himself away. Just then Uryens \n               and a small party of knights rides up through the tents and \n               dismounts in front of the church. Uryens helps a lady off \n               her horse and joins the cortege on foot.\n\n                                     URYENS\n                         Merlin, don't you join the \n                         celebration?\n\n               Merlin, who was slinking away through the throng of \n               bystanders, looks up. What he sees sends a chill through his \n               body.\n\n               At Uryens' side stands a young woman of sinister beauty, \n               with bewitching eyes of ice. Merlin just stares at her, and \n               she smiles back at him faintly.\n\n                                     URYENS\n                         My wife, Merlin. Lady Morgana of \n                         Cornwall.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         I remember you, Merlin. I was a child. \n                         You took my brother away.\n\n               Merlin laughs. Uryens shrugs and continues into the chapel \n               with Morgana. As she enters she glances back, and just then \n               Merlin steals a look, their eyes meet.\n\n               INT. CHAPEL - DAY\n\n               Uryens and Morgana take their places near the altar. Arthur \n               and Guenevere kneel before the Bishop, and Arthur takes her \n               hand. The clatter of armor mingles with the enthusiastic, \n               happy singing of the children, and seems to strengthen their \n               song.\n\n               EXT. SITE OF THE SWORD IN THE STONE - EVENING\n\n               The chorus carries across the field to the dark wall of trees \n               from which issues another chorus, of hoots and squawks and \n               howls. Merlin advances along the edge of the forest. He stops \n               by the stone that once held the sword, his eyes wild. He \n               forgets his inner torment when he sees a plant at the base \n               of the stone. He kneels beside it and plucks it. He admires \n               its strange flowers; he smells them.\n\n               Two feet appear at his side. He rises to be face to face \n               with Morgana. They look deep into each other. Then Merlin \n               breaks the silence.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         You left your husband's side?

CHAPEL - EVENING\n\n               Arthur and Guenevere are radiant with joy, and Lancelot behind \n               them mirrors the ceremony of their joining in his armor; and \n               the sweet voices of the children fill the chapel as the Bishop \n               pours the wine into the chalice, and lifts it up before him, \n               blessing it.\n\n               He turns to the royal couple.\n\n                                     BISHOP\n                         Drink this the blood of Jesus Christ \n                         our Lord.\n\n               The chalice seems to burn with a mystical light; and as the \n               chorus soars:\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               A LEGEND APPEARS:\n\n               \"And Arthur built his castle, Camelot.

FOREST, STREAM - DAY\n\n               It is shadowy and dark; ancient trees creak, unseen animals \n               cry out. A rabbit hops into view and a boy leaps forward, \n               grabbing the animal by the ears before it can move. He--\n               Perceval--is a wild boy of seventeen, dressed in skins with \n               an endearing and childlike smile.\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                              (to the rabbit)\n                         Sorry. Hungry.\n\n               A din is heard to the forest, and it grows. Perceval glances \n               around, panicked. The sound is the rubbing of leather upon \n               leather, of metal on metal, for now a mounted figure in armor \n               hovers over the terrified boy.\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                              (stuttering)\n                         Have I taken too much?\n\n               He lets the rabbit go free. The threatening figure dismounts. \n               And Perceval, cartwheels backward, landing in the stream and \n               scooping a fish out.\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                              (desperately trying \n                              to ingratiate)\n                         I had rabbit yesterday. Today I'll \n                         eat fish... No?\n\n               He returns the fish to the water. The figure steps into a \n               pool of sunlight and a glorious halo streaks from the armor. \n               It is Lancelot.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         Don't be afraid.\n\n               Perceval is overcome with astonishment, and he kneels.\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         You're an angel!

SPARSE FOREST - DAY\n\n               Lancelot is cantering and Perceval is running alongside, \n               shouting in gasps.\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         I'll learn... take me... to the \n                         King...

Lancelot reins \n               to a halt.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         Very well.

The world is that big?\n\n               EXT. OUTSIDE CAMELOT, FOREST - DAY\n\n               Perceval cannot believe his eyes. As Lancelot and Kay talk \n               about him out of earshot, he sees things that he's never \n               seen before; and he gapes like the country bumpkin that he \n               is.\n\n               Dragon-like kites sweep low, maneuvered by children. In a \n               meadow among the trees, knights hone their skills with lance \n               and sword, and ladies watch and their \"bright eyes rain \n               influence and judge the prize.\" And then, there is Camelot \n               itself; the great gate and the drawbridge; the massive walls, \n               and the soaring towers and spires above.\n\n               Perceval rushes up to Lancelot and Kay.\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         Who will give me my sword?\n\n               Kay is not at all pleased; nonetheless he takes the boy by \n               the ear and leads him across the drawbridge and into the \n               castle.\n\n                                     KAY\n                         Kitchen knives and greasy spits will \n                         be your weapons, boy.\n\n               Lancelot smiles to himself, hesitation, lingering before the \n               great gate of Camelot.\n\n               There is a walkway suspended in the trees above, that also \n               leads to the castle, and promenading on it is a group of \n               women, Guenevere and her ladies-in-waiting. The Queen sees \n               Lancelot and hastens toward him.\n\n               Lancelot sees her, and mounts his horse and heads back into \n               the forest. She stops, somewhat ahead of the ladies, and \n               watches wistfully.\n\n               Lancelot turns back and seeing her one last time, draws down \n               his visor and spurs his horse into a canter.\n\n               He passes two commoners who are heading for the castle, one \n               fat and the other thin, and they are locked in hot dispute. \n               Their wives keep them from coming to blows and their children \n               spur them on, enjoying the excitement.\n\n               Lancelot is swallowed by the forest.\n\n               INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE, CAMELOT - DAY\n\n               Guenevere, bearing a bowl of perfect, deep red apples, \n               approaches the Round Table, where Arthur sits and Merlin at \n               his side, attending to the affairs of the kingdom. Quite a \n               few of the knights occupy their seats, talking with each \n               other, drinking and laughing, attended by ladies and pages. \n               Guenevere places the apples at Lancelot's empty place and \n               takes her seat next to Arthur.\n\n               In the archways that lead into the hall, petitioners wait, \n               eating, drinking, talking among themselves. In the din, no \n               one pays attention to the vehement arguing of the fat man \n               and the thin man, which continues even here. The hall is the \n               burgeoning, happy center of the kingdom.\n\n               But Merlin is oblivious to the lively clamor. He gazes like \n               a lovesick puppy across the table at Morgana, who bends over \n               whispering to a knight at the table, the young Sir Gahalt,, \n               while his older brother Sir Gawain listens. Morgana notices \n               Merlin's stare and smiles at him, and then resumes her \n               flirtation with Sir Gahalt, much to Merlin's annoyance.\n\n               Sir Kay ushers the thin man and the fat man into the open \n               space at the center of the table for their audience with the \n               king. They quarrel even as Kay tries to present them, and \n               the attention of the hall gradually focuses on them.\n\n               The two men talk at once, interrupting, overlapping.\n\n                         FAT MAN\n                 I brew ale, sir--from \n                 old shoes--I am an \n                 honest tradesman sir. \n                 I must sell what I \n                 produce. He won't buy \n                 ale and he won't pay. \n                 Pay up! He leans over \n                 the barrel and sucks \n                 in the vapors. The \n                 vapors are mine.\n\n                                                       THIN MAN\n                                               How would you know I, sir, \n                                               have the misfortune to \n                                               live next to this \n                                               criminal... What loss in \n                                               that? Not to me! Pay for \n                                               what? Why?! They are \n                                               floating on the wind. \n\n               Arthur is both amused and exasperated.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Enough!... What is a fair price for \n                         the smell of your ale?\n\n                                     FAT MAN\n                         That's why we have come to you, sir \n                         There's no one else who can tell us.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         What does it cost to get drunk on \n                         your ale?\n\n                                     FAT MAN\n                         At least three shillings, sir.\n\n               Arthur addresses the Thin Man.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Give me three shillings.\n\n               The Thin Man is crestfallen, the smile gone from his face. \n               He reluctantly hands the coins to Kay, who gives them to \n               Arthur. Arthur tosses them in the air and lets them fall on \n               a metal plate. He hands them back to the Thin Man, who is \n               totally confused now, as is everybody else.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         For the smell of your ale, the jingle \n                         of his coins.\n\n               The knights roar with laughter and the Fat Man and the Thin \n               Man look at each other in astonishment. Perceval lets out a \n               raucous laugh that wins him a glance of disapproval from \n               Kay.\n\n               INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE - NIGHT\n\n               The din of the petitioners is replaced by music. It is the \n               hour of the evening feast, and all knights are present, except \n               Lancelot. Whole tree trunks burn in the great fireplace, and \n               lambs roast on spits in the flames. Pages run to and fro \n               with trays of food and wine, Perceval among them.\n\n               Morgana stops beside Merlin.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         What did I see today in the wizard's \n                         eyes? Censure, because I enjoy a few \n                         words with a young handsome knight?\n\n               Merlin is in agony, a bug stuck on a pin.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         No, no, of course not.

I am jealous. I want \n                         to write poems about you with \n                         moonbeams, make the sea sing your \n                         name...\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         A lovestruck page!\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, \n                         please... Morgana.\n\n               She does, laughing and in complete control. His hand \n               immediately slides onto her thigh. She removes it, but holds \n               it in her hand, toying with his fingers.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         A steamy, panting, lovestruck page. \n                         But what good are songs and poems to \n                         me? They are the barter of ordinary \n                         love. A gift that reflected your \n                         greatness is the only one worthy of \n                         your love.\n\n               Merlin looks at her, knowing already, sad yet eager.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         I showed you all my conjuring \n                         tricks...\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         The deepest secrets, the forbidden \n                         formulas...\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Maybe... maybe...\n\n               Merlin's thoughts have carried him far away, when he realizes \n               that Arthur is addressing him.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Merlin, are you counselor to the \n                         King, or to my sister?\n\n               Some knights laugh.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         At your service, sir.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Then answer me this. For years peace \n                         has reigned in the land. Crops grow \n                         in abundance, there is no want. Every \n                         one of my subjects enjoys his portion \n                         of happiness and justice, even those \n                         whose tiresome misunderstandings we \n                         must resolve here each day. Tell me, \n                         Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it \n                         seems?\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Good and evil; there is never one \n                         without the other.\n\n               Arthur is taken aback.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Never where you expect it, that's \n                         all I know.\n\n               He chuckles softly and Arthur is puzzled. A knight speaks \n               out, the young knight with whom Morgana was flirting. His \n               manner is sarcastic.\n\n                                     SIR GAHALT\n                         If we have peace and justice, why is \n                         Lancelot never with us? Why is he \n                         always riding out on his quests? He \n                         must know where this evil is.\n\n                                     SIR GAWAIN\n                         Could there be evil within Lancelot \n                         himself? To live above human folly, \n                         as is his aim, is to be overly proud.\n\n                                     SIR GAHALT\n                         He pays no heed even to the Queens \n                         longing for his company.\n\n               The hall falls silent, all eyes upon the Queen.\n\n                                     GUENEVERE\n                              (lashing out)\n                         What is it you would have your words \n                         mean, Sir Gahalt?\n\n               Frightened, Gahalt doesn't answer.

In the idleness \n                         that comes with peace gossip has \n                         bread its own evil. You merely repeat \n                         it. Please, sir, have one of those \n                         apples that Lancelot loves, and in \n                         that gesture partake of its goodness.\n\n               Morgana picks the bowl up and as she does so, unseen by any \n               and with a magician's dexterity, she thrusts her fingernails \n               deep into the top apple. She gives the bowl to Guenevere, \n               who takes it and sweeps around to where Sir Gahalt sits, \n               followed by Morgana. The young knight jumps to his feet.\n\n                                     GUENEVERE\n                         Take one, Sir Gahalt.\n\n                                     SIR GAHALT\n                         I am most honored, my lady.\n\n               He is too shy to take the shiniest, most beautiful apple on \n               top, and goes for another one. Morgana giggles, and he looks \n               at her. She looks at the apple on top and then smiles \n               encouragingly at him. Sir Gahalt takes it and starts eating \n               as the Queen returns to her seat.\n\n               With the third bite his is unable to breathe. His face goes \n               red and he rises to his feet, attempting to call out.\n\n               He falls, dying immediately. All leap to their feet, and \n               Arthur rushes to the young knight. Merlin is asleep and far \n               from human affairs.\n\n               Arthur and Sir Gawain rise from the body of the young knight. \n               Sir Gawain backs away from Arthur and points at Guenevere, \n               trembling with cold rage.\n\n                                     SIR GAWAIN\n                         Hear me, Lord Arthur, and knights \n                         and chieftains: I charge Guenevere \n                         with the murder of my brother.\n\n               Guenevere, white and with a broken voice, turns to Arthur.\n\n                                     GUENEVERE\n                         I didn't...

Guenevere falls into her seat. Arthur \n               searches the eyes of his knights and they evade him.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Sir Caradoc!

Someone speaks \n               up. It is Perceval, who kneels before the Queen. His voice \n               is unnaturally loud, and his eyes shine with held-back tears; \n               he stutters.\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         I will champion you, my lady.\n\n               He is overwhelmed by his own boldness. He looks around. All \n               eyes are upon him.

He will come!\n\n               Perceval hurries from the hall. Arthur looks away, ashamed, \n               and his eyes fall on Merlin, twitching and mumbling in his \n               sleep.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Boys!... boys will be boys...\n\n               EXT. HOVEL - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY\n\n               In full armor but for his helmet, Lancelot is seated at a \n               small table in the shadow of a tree, eating an apple.\n\n               A young girl is turning a chicken on a spit, and her mother \n               is removing freshly-baked bread from an oven. It is very \n               peaceful and silent until, galloping all out, Perceval \n               arrives. Frantic, out of breath, he leaps from his lathered \n               horse.\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         I have found you. The Queen.

These good \n                         ladies, for whom I intervened once, \n                         will honor me with a meal.

Perceval falls silent, in awe of Lancelot.\n\n               INT. BEDCHAMBER, CAMELOT - NIGHT\n\n               Arthur stands hunched over the fireplace, staring into the \n               flames. Guenevere paces back and forth to a window.\n\n                                     GUENEVERE\n                         Why can't you be my champion?\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         If I am your judge, I cannot be your \n                         champion.

Numb with hurt, she goes to a \n               tall curtained window, and draws it open, and stands there \n               looking out upon the surrounding forest, silent and still \n               beneath the moon.\n\n               EXT. WINDOW - NIGHT\n\n               She cries softly, and she whispers the name of the great \n               knight.\n\n               EXT. EDGE OF THE FOREST, WALLS OF CAMELOT - NIGHT.\n\n               A mounted knight stands motionless at the edge of the forest, \n               his armor gleaming with dark lustre. It is Lancelot. His \n               eyes are raised to the high window, where he sees Guenevere. \n               He watches her in silence. In the high window Guenevere draws \n               the curtain and Lancelot reins back into the forest.\n\n               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT\n\n               Lancelot has unsaddled and tethered his horse in a small \n               clearing. He sits, resting back against a tree. He removes \n               his helmet; he plants his sword before him, like a cross. He \n               loosens the ties of his breastplate. He waits for day, \n               yawning, tired. But his eyes burn, and he closes them and \n               nods off to sleep.\n\n               A knight appears silently hovering over him. Lancelot looks \n               up, and his eyes go wide with fear. The knight towering above \n               him wears armor identical to his, and he raises his sword, \n               and the blade is descending upon Lancelot. Lancelot draws \n               his sword from the ground and rolls away, but the knight's \n               sword slices through his shoulder joint. Lancelot attempts \n               to rise but already the knight, Lancelot's mirror image, is \n               upon him. From the ground, Lancelot parries the blow and \n               slashes at the opponent's knee, cutting through the joint in \n               the armor and severing the leg.\n\n               The knight doesn't fall, doesn't bleed, doesn't cry out. On \n               one leg he comes forward, a horror. Lancelot is paralyzed by \n               fear. As the knight leaps upon Lancelot, Lancelot rises to \n               meet him, impaling himself on the knight's sword below the \n               hauberk. He throws the knight to the ground, and comes down \n               upon him. He rips off the helmet and the breastplate. The \n               armor is empty and Lancelot rolls over on his back, awakening \n               from the nightmare with his own sword deep in his stomach, \n               and in his hand his own helmet and breastplate, while other \n               parts of his armor lie strewn around him.\n\n               Only then does he become conscious of the terrible pain and \n               the shock of the truth. He grabs the hilt of his sword and \n               draws it from his stomach. He curls up in agony, clutching a \n               fistful of leaves to the wound.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         Guenevere, I fight against myself...\n\n               He loses consciousness.\n\n               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND OUTSIDE CAMELOT - DAWN\n\n               The Bishop blesses the field. Guenevere, numb and \n               disbelieving, is being led to the stake, which rises from a \n               bed of straw and wood. Arthur watches, in shock. Other knights \n               and ladies keep their distance, watching darkly, stealing \n               glances at Arthur, mumbling disapproval of his refusing to \n               defend Guenevere. In battle dress, Sir Gawain rides up and \n               down the jousting run on a snorting and powerful horse, \n               practicing. Perceval, in a mail doublet, waits beside a mangy \n               roan, his face burning with anxiety.\n\n               Guenevere is tied to the stake. All eyes watch for the \n               approach of her champion. Arthur goes to Perceval.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Is he coming?\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         He heard Lady Guenevere's request \n                         and he said nothing. That is all.\n\n               Arthur hides his pain behind a rigid mask.\n\n               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND - DAY\n\n               The sun has risen shining cruelly into Guenevere's eyes; the \n               queen is alone at the stake. Sir Gawain rides up to King \n               Arthur, who waits alone, separated from the others.\n\n                                     SIR GAWAIN\n                         My Lord, the sun is upon the field. \n                         The Queen has no champion.

He searches the tree line for a sign \n               of Lancelot. He looks from Guenevere at the stake to his own \n               knights watching him. He draws Excalibur. A gasp goes through \n               the crowd of onlookers.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Boy, kneel.\n\n               Perceval leaps from his horse and bends his knee before the \n               King. Arthur brings the sword down on the boy's shoulder, \n               giving him the three strokes.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         In the name of God, of St. Michael, \n                         and St. George, I make you a knight. \n                         Rise, Sir...\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         ...Perceval!\n\n               Gawain shakes his head disdainfully as Perceval mounts back \n               into the saddle, his eyes burning with fervor.\n\n               Sir Gawain and Perceval ride to opposite ends of the field. \n               The spectators fall silent, all staring blankly, their senses \n               dulled by the tragedy, at the uneven combatants.\n\n               A cry goes up. Lancelot rides out of the forest. He rides up \n               to the King and salutes him. Arthur smiles at his old friend, \n               tears of joy in his eyes. Lancelot bows toward Guenevere and \n               rides on to where Perceval waits.\n\n               Lancelot reaches out to touch Perceval's cheek.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         It's my task to prove the Queen's \n                         innocence.\n\n               Perceval cannot reply, his eyes affixed on the blood that \n               trickles from Lancelot's hauberk. Lancelot raises his lance \n               in salute to Gawain across the field. Gawain salutes in \n               answer.\n\n               The two huge knights charge at each other, each man's spear \n               tip making contact with the other's armor, and in the violent \n               collision both are unhorsed. Lancelot is slower at getting \n               to his feet and drawing his sword.\n\n               He is bleeding below the hauberk from his self-inflicted \n               wound.\n\n               In the first onslaught Lancelot fights defensively, falling \n               back. He has to toss aside his shield and hold his stomach \n               with his shield hand.\n\n               Morgana watches with Merlin. Every terrible blow of sword on \n               sword reverberates through her body pleasurable. Merlin is \n               captivated by her cruel sensuality.\n\n               EXT. JOUSTING GROUND - LATE DAY\n\n               They swing and thrust at each other with slower but bone-\n               crushing force, both unsteady now. Blood seeps from Lancelot's \n               feet, leaving awful footprints on the earth. Finally, with a \n               daring thrust, Lancelot lifts Gawain's visor and the sword \n               tip is before his eyes. Gawain drops his sword and shield, \n               kneels and speaks in a voice hoarse with weariness.\n\n                                     SIR GAWAIN\n                         The Queen is innocent. I yield to \n                         your mercy, Sir Lancelot.\n\n               Lancelot collapses in a dead faint.\n\n               INT. CELL, CAMELOT - EVENING\n\n               Eyes closed, Lancelot lies on a bed, naked but for a cloth \n               across his loins. His minor wounds have been dressed, and \n               Merlin is kneading the huge gash in his stomach, working the \n               severed flesh together. Guenevere stands on one side of the \n               bed, Arthur on the other, both looking down upon Lancelot, \n               relieved and not daring to look at each other.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         Flesh on flesh.

Merlin exits, and draws Arthur away with him.\n\n               Arthur is deeply tormented.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Merlin, tell me.

That \n                         frightens me.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         A king should be afraid, always. The \n                         enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush \n                         in the dark corridors of his castle, \n                         on the deer paths of his forest, or \n                         in the gray and winding paths of a \n                         more tangled forest, in here.\n\n               He taps his skull and smiles.\n\n               INT. CELL - EVENING\n\n               Lancelot is staring into Guenevere's eyes. She opens her \n               shift, baring a breast with the innocence of a mother \n               preparing to suckle a child. She presses her breast to his \n               wound, her face to his chest, her arms enfolding him. She \n               whispers.\n\n                                     GUENEVERE\n                         Flesh on flesh. I will heal you.\n\n               His body trembles and his eyes brim with tears. He is lost.\n\n               INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE, CAMELOT - NIGHT\n\n               The court is assembled, for the evening feast. There is music \n               and heavy drinking. Some knights are slouched across the \n               table. Lancelot, still weak, takes his seat, looking at the \n               drunken and frivolous knights. Arthur catches it, and they \n               smile at each other.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         They miss the battlefield. I think \n                         we do too.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         But one can still keep a sword sharp \n                         riding out in the name of the King's \n                         law.\n\n               Guenevere cannot tear her eyes from Lancelot. He avoids her \n               look. Arthur looks from Guenevere to Lancelot, and speaks \n               softly to him, across her, and with stabbing directness.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         It is not easy for the young ones to \n                         learn knightly virtues without the \n                         hard teaching of war and quest. It \n                         is only your example, Lancelot, that \n                         binds them now.\n\n               Then, addressing the hall:\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Which is the greatest quality of \n                         knighthood? Courage? Compassion? \n                         Loyalty? Humility? What do you say, \n                         Merlin?\n\n               He is bent close to Morgana, whispering. Only when the hall \n               rings with laughter does he look up.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         What?\n                              (then seeing he has \n                              an audience)\n                         The greatest? They blend together \n                         like the metals we mix to make a \n                         good sword.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         I didn't ask for poetry. Which is \n                         it?\n\n               Merlin looks from Arthur to Guenevere to Lancelot to Arthur.\n\n                                     MERLIN\n                         All right. Truth. It must be truth, \n                         above all. When a man lies he murders \n                         some part of the world.\n\n               An uneasy silence falls upon the feast. Guenevere and Lancelot \n               cannot look at each other, and Arthur feels it. Lancelot \n               jumps to his feet.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         Conversation and court life don't \n                         suit me. I must take my rest in the \n                         forest.\n\n               Guenevere stifles her dismay.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         It is deep...\n\n               Arthur is about to rise to embrace him, but checks himself.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         You will be sorely missed. Heal \n                         yourself and come back.\n\n               The exchange has become closely intimate, even though they \n               stand apart and speak before everyone in the large hall. \n               Lancelot leaves. Only Guenevere cannot watch.\n\n               EXT. FOREST GLADE -DAY\n\n               Water gurgles from a rock that is captive in the roots of an \n               ancient oak. Lancelot, in armor, reclines against its trunk, \n               the roots cradling him. He is perfectly still, drawing life \n               from the vibrant, all-enfolding forest.\n\n               Flower petals drift on the breeze. Trees sigh. Fox and rabbit, \n               sparrow and hawk, at peace with each other, watch over the \n               knight.\n\n               EXT. FOREST -DAY\n\n               A horse and rider tear through the thick undergrowth. It is \n               Guenevere. The forest races past her as she gallops toward \n               the glade, brambles tearing at her flesh and clothes.\n\n               EXT. FOREST GLADE - DAY\n\n               Lancelot gets to his feet, tense. Guenevere dismounts and \n               approaches. She is flushed and breathless from the wild race. \n               Her horse, left free, wanders over to his and grazes beside \n               it.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         Why? You will destroy Arthur, and \n                         us...\n\n               She moves closer and he thrusts out his mailed fist to keep \n               her away. She clutches it and presses the metal to her soft \n               tear-streaked cheek.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         The law forbids it.\n\n                                     GUENEVERE\n                         Love demands it.\n\n               Hungry with passion, she embraces the cold unmoving armor, \n               kissing it.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         There are things about love--\n\n                                     GUENEVERE\n                         --Nothing!\n\n               He steps back, drawing his sword. He holds it up by the blade \n               between them.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         By my knight's sword, I swore faith--\n\n               And before he can finish she grabs the blade to push it aside. \n               He holds it fast. Blood streams from her bare hands. He cannot \n               prevail without cutting them deeply. He lets go of the sword, \n               and she lets it fall to the ground.\n\n               She embraces his still and defeated hulk. She kisses the \n               metal, and sensation shoots through him, dizzying him.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         Guenevere...\n\n               He folds her in his arm, and their bodies lock together as \n               though a trap had sprung. Their mouths meet, each devouring \n               the other...\n\n               EXT.

Here I must \n                         stay.\n\n               They embrace. Merlin is on the verge of tears, his face \n               immediately sad and finally ancient. Arthur exits.\n\n               Morgana, who has been watching from the shadows, watching \n               from the shadows, slinks up to Merlin's side.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         Crazy old fool.

I have helped \n                         men--or meddled in their affairs, if \n                         you would have it that way--since \n                         the dawn of time. Now let them live \n                         by their own laws. Let them stand on \n                         their own feet. The gods of once are \n                         gone forever, it is time for men... \n                         Morgana, make a man out of me. Kiss \n                         me.\n\n               He reaches to touch her lips. She cradles his hand in hers \n               and doesn't allow Merlin to kiss her. She kisses his knuckles \n               and stares into his eyes, stoking his desire.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         You know what I want.

FOREST - NIGHT\n\n               Arthur and Sir Kay gallop through the forest, silently. It \n               is not a dream.  Their armor and the hooves of their horses \n               are muffled with pieces of cloth.\n\n               EXT. FOREST GLADE - NIGHT\n\n               Only Nature will ever see their love; the creatures of the \n               air, tree and ground witness the final reality of their \n               passion and sense its unfathomable depths, singing of it in \n               a hundred languages. Lancelot and Guenevere are naked and \n               interlocked, one being, suspended in the darkness in the eye \n               of the forest.\n\n               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT\n\n               Arthur walks soundlessly through the trees, approaching the \n               glade. The forest falls suddenly silent.\n\n               EXT. FOREST GLADE - NIGHT\n\n               All passion spent, locked in each other's arms, Lancelot and \n               Guenevere drift off into sleep.\n\n               Arthur comes upon them. He stands over them. He draws \n               Excalibur. Checking all emotion, he holds it above his head. \n               The ancient steel glows darkly.\n\n               The lovers faces are serene and innocently beautiful. He \n               hesitates, tormented. His mask of anguish gives way to \n               determination and calm. He strikes the sword home, letting \n               go of it.\n\n               He backs away, turns and disappears into the forest.\n\n               EXT. FOREST GLADE - DAWN\n\n               The sky is red; so is the steel of Excalibur. Lancelot awakens \n               and starts at what he sees. His cry stirs Guenevere. They \n               are horrified to see Excalibur impaled in the ground between \n               their entwined bodies. It has pierced their union without \n               grazing their flesh. They leap up and back away, unable to \n               speak at first.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         Why didn't he kill us?\n\n                                     GUENEVERE\n                         He has given up.\n\n               She kneels before the sword, embracing the hilt to her breast.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         The King without his sword, the land \n                         without a king...\n\n                                     GUENEVERE\n                         We are to blame.\n\n               Lancelot stumbles into the forest, berserk with guilt. He \n               rages against a small tree, crying out, and he rips its roots \n               from the ground, the terrible tearing and renting the symbol \n               of his own inner torment.\n\n               Guenevere sinks to the ground next to Lancelot's empty armor \n               and his abandoned sword.\n\n               INT.

CAVE BENEATH CAMELOT\n\n               They pass through jaws of stalactites and stalagmites. Merlin \n               cracks his staff whip-like and a ball of fire billows up \n               from the tip and illuminates a cave wildly veined and \n               filigreed with minerals and crusted with growths of crystals. \n               The light goes out but the malachite and the gold, the quartz, \n               diamond and beryllium burn dully.

Merlin utters a formula and \n               the fog coalesces around them into the shimmering presence \n               of crystal walls, fountains raining jewels, flowers made of \n               scented air, a bed of glass shot with light and covered with \n               skins of animals dead before the time of man, goblets of \n               ruby, tapestries woven of golden hair. She reaches out to \n               touch the wall and her hand plunges through the unmaterialized \n               illusion.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         It's only a semblance.

She turns to watch him asleep in the bed.\n\n               She utters the charm of Summoning learnt from Merlin, and \n               the room melts into an eddying carmine fog. Within it, Merlin \n               struggles to awaken from the torpor of love, alarmed.\n\n               Outside, Morgana utters the charm of Making and the gaseous \n               mass begins to crystallize.\n\n               Inside, Merlin is rising to his feet, breathing the red fog, \n               his movements slowing to a standstill, his mouth opening in \n               a scream of horror.\n\n               The cloud has metamorphosed into a magnificent cluster of \n               red crystals.  Morgana peers into its facets and there she \n               sees, in fragments, Merlin's terror... an eye, the gaping \n               mouth, a clawing hand--as he is entombed in the stone.

He comes upon \n               a knight seducing a lady in a dark corner by the chapel door, \n               his hand under her gown.

Before he \n               can talk she silences him with a tender caress.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         Do you know what Guenevere's maids \n                         have whispered?\n\n               He shakes his head.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         That when the King returned from \n                         battle...\n\n               She begins untying the laces of his metal thigh and shin \n               guards.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         ...Guenevere would unlace his armor \n                         and massage the burns where metal \n                         rubbed on flesh...\n\n               She is stripping his legs naked, gently touching the flesh \n               with her fingertips.

Morgana weeps, embracing his \n               knees. He rests his hand gently upon her head, choked with \n               remembrance, soothing her. But as she weeps, she incants a \n               charm.\n\n               Arthur looks down upon her, and the woman who looks up at \n               him is Guenevere, a Guenevere with cold ice eyes. He is made \n               weak by desire and weakened further by magic. He holds her \n               face adoringly.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Guenevere!

That you, King, and I, your Queen, \n                         beget a son to bond our love and to \n                         strengthen our weak kingdom with a \n                         successor. Come, my lord...\n\n               She draws him to the floor and upon her body, holding him \n               tightly to himself. Arthur trembles with excitement, pathetic \n               in his desperate passion.\n\n               As he takes her, she shudders, losing control of the charm, \n               and her features change till once again \"Guenevere\" is \n               Morgana. She holds him in a tight embrace so that he may not \n               see her. She whispers in his ear.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         The moon flows in my blood to meet \n                         your seed. And already I bear him \n                         who will be King.\n\n               Arthur wrenches himself away so he can see her, her arms \n               still around his neck. He looks down upon her, aghast, \n               incredulous.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         I could easily kill you, brother. \n                         But I want you to live to see our \n                         son be King. In me, the blood of \n                         Cornwall will have its revenge; in \n                         me, the blood of Uther will show its \n                         dark side.\n\n               She presses her thumbs into his neck and he faints.\n\n               EXT. FOREST - CAMELOT - DAY\n\n               Morgana, with a small party, rides away from the castle \n               through the lashing storm, till they are taken from sight in \n               the folds of the forest...\n\n               INT. CHAPEL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT\n\n               Lightening forks across the sky, illuminating the interior. \n               The chapel has been transformed into a place of satanic \n               worship. Held up and surrounded by hooded figures, Morgana \n               lies on the altar, her pregnant belly huge; and her features \n               are fierce with passionate intensity. She writhes in the \n               pangs of childbirth.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         Stand back, all of you.

CHAPEL, CAMELOT - NIGHT\n\n               Arthur enters, pale and haunted. Mass is being celebrated, \n               and some knights are present. Those not asleep whisper to \n               each other about the King. The sound of an approaching storm \n               is heard.\n\n               As the priest raises the chalice to consecrate the wine. \n               Arthur comes down the aisle and steps onto the altar. He \n               reaches out to grasp the chalice from the priest's hands.\n\n               INT. CHAPEL, TINTAGEL CASTLE - NIGHT\n\n               Morgana holds aloft her beautiful newborn baby, his body \n               glistening in a flash of lightening. She is triumphant.\n\n               INT. CHAPEL, CAMELOT - NIGHT.\n\n               A bolt of lightening strikes the chalice, rocking the chapel, \n               and Arthur is knocked back violently.\n\n               Rain lashes in through the shattered window upon the terrified \n               knights. They and the priest back away. Arthur is left alone. \n               He rises and goes to the chalice, which is bent and cracked. \n               He kneels before it.

Many of the knights are in attendance, in \n               full armor.\n\n               Ladies and pages watch from dark corners. Arthur addresses \n               the fellowship.\n\n               He holds the cracked chalice in his hands. He burns with a \n               new-found fervor.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Who will ride the labyrinths of the \n                         forest, to the very root of his soul, \n                         to the very ends of the earth, to \n                         find the secret that will redeem us \n                         from the evil that has fallen upon \n                         us, and make this chalice, and \n                         ourselves, whole again?\n\n               Gawain rises and draws his sword in salute.\n\n                                     SIR GAWAIN\n                         I will ride forth in the name of \n                         that quest, and commit my strength \n                         and my soul to it.\n\n               Perceval, Kay and a few others draw their swords and touch \n               their lips to the blades in oath.

SNOWSCAPE - DAY\n\n               Under a leaden sky, Gawain drives his horse through swirling \n               snow. He comes upon a mounted knight who is frozen in his \n               tracks. He brushes the snow from the man's face. The frozen \n               features belong to Caradoc. He slowly continues on his way.\n\n               EXT. DEAD FOREST - DAY\n\n               Dangling from the branches of a dead tree are a dozen dead \n               knights of the Round Table, crows pecking at the rotting \n               flesh in the chinks of armor. Perceval rides up, cries out \n               in horror, and spurs his horse away.\n\n               EXT. MOORS - DAY\n\n               The rotting carcasses of sheep. The crops blackened and \n               withered on the stalk. Hungry peasants head for a distant \n               hill.\n\n               EXT, HILLSIDE, MOORS - DAY\n\n               A giant head has been carved out of an outcrop of rock, its \n               stone mouth gaping toward the sky.\n\n               People are congregated around the mouth. Peasants and farmers, \n               they are wild with excitement, responding to drums throbbing \n               and bagpipes wailing.\n\n               They watch Morgana, who is surrounded by knights in dark \n               armor. At her side is an angelic boy of eight, his eyes cold \n               as his mother's. Morgana is more beautiful than ever, in \n               flowing druidic robes, the gossamer silk clinging to her \n               sweat-drenched body.\n\n               She is standing by the deep hole which forms the giant's \n               open mouth. It is covered by a tooth-like grating acting as \n               a drain for the blood of human sacrifices made there. Before \n               her is Gawain, chained and struggling against five strong \n               men who hold him. Morgana lifts a dagger and plunges it into \n               Gawain's chest. The fountain of blood that gushes from the \n               great knight's body drives the crowd into a frenzy.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                              (intoning)\n                         The blood of this knight will feed \n                         the god in the earth, he is weak \n                         with hunger, and he will be made \n                         strong by this blood. Then he will \n                         plant his seed, and the land will be \n                         fertile once again.\n\n               Gawain, his blood flowing from him and into the giant's mouth, \n               looks up in anguish. His bellowing voice is echoed and \n               amplified by the hollow beneath the drain.\n\n                                     GAWAIN\n                         Arthur, forgive me. I die without \n                         the secret. I have failed.\n\n               EXT. MOORS - DAY\n\n               Gawain's death cry and the din of the ritual carries to \n               Perceval's ears as he wanders through the wasteland. He draws \n               down his visor and spurs his horse forward.\n\n               EXT. HILLSIDE, MOORS - DAY\n\n               He gallops toward the giant's head. He checks his sword and \n               lowers his lance.\n\n               The knight charging forward on his war horse is an awesome \n               sight, but the crowd around the giant's mouth is strangely \n               unfrightened. Morgana is excited; she turns to the boy.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         Look, Mordred, a true prize for the \n                         giant. The lamb rides into our jaws.\n\n               Perceval is galloping toward them when the ground gives way \n               beneath the horse, and he and the animal plunge into a pit. \n               The cheering crowd rushes to the edge of the trap.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                              (to Mordred)\n                         You must kill him, for this knight \n                         is dear to your father. You must do \n                         it and learn to enjoy your father's \n                         pain.\n\n               Her knights drag Perceval, unarmed, into Morgana's presence.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         Have you found what you search for? \n                         Have you found what Arthur seeks?\n\n               Perceval doesn't answer, defiant and hiding his fear.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         You haven't, or you would be smiling \n                         now in the face of death.

I'll show you the mystery \n                         of life. It's death...\n                              (to Mordred)\n                         Do it, Mordred!\n\n               Holding Perceval by his limbs and hair, the men force him \n               down on the bloody grating, drawing back his head, exposing \n               his throat. Morgana kneels by his head, and draws the boy \n               beside her. She holds the tip of the dagger to Perceval's \n               neck and takes Mordred's hand and wraps it around the handle.  \n               Perceval is choked with fear, his heart pounding in his \n               throat.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         Feel the life through the dagger, \n                         child. It belongs to you.\n\n               The boy looks up at his mother. The vein in Perceval's neck \n               pushes against the dagger's point.\n\n                                     MORDRED\n                         I feel it, Mother. I will give his \n                         blood to the giant.\n\n               The boy raises the dagger, and hesitates just a bit. Perceval \n               resigns himself bravely. He looks the child calmly in the \n               eye. Mordred brings down the blade without strength, just \n               piercing the skin with the tip. He lets go of the dagger, \n               afraid now of his mistake.\n\n               The dagger clatters to the grating and slips away down the \n               drain, before Morgana can retrieve it. She rages against \n               Mordred. In the confusion, Perceval tears loose, the men \n               holding him slipping on the blood-wet stone.\n\n               Perceval runs through the crowd. Immediately, lance lowered, \n               a knight is upon him. Perceval leaps toward him, catching \n               the lance in his hand, and pulling down the rider with it. \n               He jumps the rider and draws the knight's sword. Whirling \n               the lance and cutting the air with the sword, he keeps back \n               the other knights for a moment, giving him time to see his \n               chance. He leaps onto the riderless horse and charges off \n               through the crowd. He reins in abruptly, the horse rearing. \n               He is wary of the ground before him; there could be a hidden \n               pit. But there is no time to think. Knights and men on foot \n               are rushing him. He spurs forward into a gallop, the horse \n               striding mightily And its hind leg sinks into a pit, the \n               animal losing its gait. But the momentum carries the horse \n               forward, and it recovers from the stumble.\n\n               Perceval gallops away.\n\n               Morgana is enraged. She shakes Mordred by the hair.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         You didn't kill him! You didn't kill \n                         him!\n\n               But suddenly she begins kissing him tenderly.\n\n                                     MORGANA\n                         My dear, sweet boy...\n\n               He just stands there emotionless, the dead center of her \n               turbulent passions.\n\n               EXT. DEAD FOREST - DAY\n\n               Perceval gallops down a trail. The black-armored knights of \n               Morgana chase him.\n\n               Perceval reins into deep cover alongside the trail. The \n               pursuers thunder past and the sound of hooves recedes. \n               Perceval checks his newly found sword, slashes the air to \n               feel the weapon's balance. He re-sheathes it. He pats the \n               horse.\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         We'll become good friends.\n\n               He starts off again, into the patchless forest of dead trees.\n\n               He is suddenly set upon by a wildman who, swinging a small \n               uprooted tree, knocks him off his horse. Perceval crashes to \n               the ground and before he can use his sword the wildman has \n               knocked it out of his hand.\n\n               It is Lancelot, demented, who furiously rains battering blows \n               on Perceval's armor, bellowing with rage. All that Perceval \n               can do is attempt to avoid the blows. Lancelot addresses \n               Perceval as if the young knight were Lancelot himself.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         Where are you going, Lancelot, in \n                         your iron tomb? Still trying to save \n                         the world?\n                              (He hammers blows \n                              into Perceval's armor)\n                         The best... the bravest... the \n                         greatest... fool that ever lived. \n                         Now the world rots. Death is king of \n                         the earth. And it is you who make it \n                         so, Lancelot.\n\n               Before Perceval can speak, Lancelot disappears again into \n               the forest, his eyes blank, as though his encounter with the \n               young knight had never happened.\n\n               A knot of pain, Perceval pulls himself up. He tries to rise \n               into the saddle. He is too hurt to do it. He starts off on \n               foot, slowly, leading the horse.\n\n               EXT. DEAD FOREST AND STREAM - NIGHT\n\n               It is very dark and Perceval has to feel his way.\n\n               He comes to the edge of a stream. He kneels to drink, and \n               the horse drinks beside him. Then he rests back on his heels, \n               brooding, too tired to rise.\n\n               He lowers his eyes, staring into the dark water, defeated, \n               empty.\n\n               Before him in the water a long thin bar of light appears. He \n               looks at it amazed. Voices are heard singing very far away. \n               He reaches out to touch the long strip of light but his hand \n               just disturbs the water. It is a reflection. The strip grows \n               wider and the ethereal music is closer.\n\n               Perceval looks up. The strip of light is before him, \n               suspended, thirty feet above. It continues to grow wider. A \n               drawbridge is being slowly lowered, allowing a powerful light \n               to escape from within.\n\n               Perceval is terrified. In pain, he slowly rises into the \n               saddle, ready to gallop off; but fascinated, hypnotized by \n               the sight, he cannot, and he stays and watches.\n\n               The dim outline of a castle becomes visible as the drawbridge \n               is lowered across the water to the ground at his feet. At \n               the center of the blast of light coming from the castle, \n               Perceval can make out a burning chalice. The music swells to \n               a terrifying pitch, searing the forest.\n\n               EXT. ENTRANCE TO CASTLE - NIGHT\n\n               At the sight of the chalice, Perceval masters his fear. Bathed \n               in light and music, he spurs the horse forward onto the \n               drawbridge.\n\n               Once he is on it, the bridge begins to rise. Unsure of its \n               footing and blinded by the light, the horse becomes skittish, \n               and Perceval has to struggle to control it. He dismounts to \n               lead it, but the horse is terrified, rears up and jumps off \n               the bridge, which continues to rise, drawn up by unseen hands.\n\n               Perceval hesitates, then advances down the sloping drawbridge \n               into the castle courtyard. All details are bleached out by \n               the blinding light. The chalice appears suspended in space, \n               and now the figure of a man can be glimpsed standing behind \n               it.\n\n               Enchanting music from unseen singers grows and weaves. \n               Perceval looks back to see the drawbridge slowly closing, \n               trapping him inside.\n\n               He approaches the figure, his courage ebbing. Hands cupping \n               the chalice, it speaks to him.\n\n                                     FIGURE\n                         What is the secret of the chalice? \n                         Who does it serve?\n\n               Perceval doesn't understand. He glances back again. The \n               drawbridge is nearly closed. Terror seizes him.\n\n               Panicked, puzzled, baffled, he backs away. He scrambles up \n               the drawbridge desperate to reach the top before it closes. \n               He claws his way up till his hand grasps the top. He heaves \n               himself through the narrow closing slit which is about to \n               crush him. He screams, and with a final effort he wriggles \n               free and topples over crashing into the water below.\n\n               EXT. DEAD FOREST AND STREAM - NIGHT\n\n               He looks up. The drawbridge thunders shut, the last thin \n               strip of light disappearing; and now he is surrounded only \n               by the silence of the forest.\n\n               Where there was a castle, now there is darkness. Perceval \n               wades through the water. He has crossed the stream and all \n               he can see and feel are tree trunks. The castle has \n               disappeared. He is utterly defeated.\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         The chalice. The secret was in my \n                         grasp. I let it slip, afraid for \n                         myself. A question was asked. I didn't \n                         understand. I didn't try. I failed...\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               A LEGEND APPEARS:\n\n               \"Nine years passed.\"\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               INT. CAVE BENEATH CAMELOT.\n\n               Dripping water is steadily encrusting the crystal with \n               limestone.\n\n               INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE, CAMELOT - DAY\n\n               Dead knights lay on biers. The once glorious seat of power \n               is falling into decay. Few are in attendance around the table. \n               Agitated, Kay enters and goes to Arthur, who is worn and \n               haggard, and aged.\n\n                                     KAY\n                         Your son Mordred is at the gate.\n\n               Arthur comes alive.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         At last...\n\n                                     KAY\n                         Don't recognize him.

Only the \n                         echo of their voices remains in this \n                         empty hall. All I have left is the \n                         memory of their fellowship. Echoes \n                         and memories.

GATE, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE CAMELOT - DAY\n\n               The drawbridge lowers slowly, and Arthur moves away from Kay \n               and the other knights, and advances across it.\n\n               Rooks wheel over the dead trees of the forest that surrounds \n               Camelot. A group of armed men waits at the edge of the forest. \n               One steps forward, a huge knight in black armor, the metal \n               defining and exaggerating the powerful musculature of his \n               body. He is Mordred, a young man of eighteen, and of \n               extraordinary beauty. A page follows ten steps behind him \n               bearing an enormous spear, its points hooded. Arthur stops \n               at the edge of the drawbridge, the huge knight a few steps \n               from him. Kay, ready for anything, moves halfway across the \n               drawbridge.\n\n               Mordred kneels on one knee.\n\n                                     MORDRED\n                         Father...\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Rise, Mordred.\n\n                                     MORDRED\n                         I have come to claim what is mine, \n                         Father.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         I recognize you only as my son, no \n                         more.\n\n                                     MORDRED\n                              (his tone is scathing)\n                         And you are the great King? The lords \n                         have rebelled. Invaders attack the \n                         coasts. Crops don't grow. There is \n                         nothing but plague and hunger in the \n                         land. Only I am feared. I will be \n                         king. You may have lost Excalibur, \n                         but I have found my own weapon of \n                         power. There.\n\n               He points to the huge lance. The page pulls a string and the \n               hood drops, revealing a diabolically sharp spear tip, its \n               metal glinting menacingly.\n\n                                     MORDRED\n                         The very spear that pierced the side \n                         of Christ as he died on the cross.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Your mother told you that?\n\n               Mordred is thrown off by the doubt Arthur has cast.

He is hunched over, broken.\n\n               EXT. BARREN LAND - EVENING\n\n               Asleep in the saddle, Perceval rides across burnt and \n               smoldering fields. The horse walks aimlessly; it is the same \n               animal, mangy and old. A hoard of children in filthy rags \n               closes in on him, begging, pulling at the horse's trappings. \n               He bolts awake and reins away. His eyes are red and feverish.\n\n               Wild hope grips him when he sees a glinting light by a \n               farmhouse. He spurs the horse forward into a gallop.\n\n               EXT. FARM - EVENING\n\n               He leaps from the saddle and a terrified woman backs away. \n               Perceval plunges his hand into the source of light. It is \n               nothing but the reflection of the dying sun in a bucketful \n               of water. Perceval covers his face.\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         Illusions. I will never find it \n                         again...

He has taken this \n                         land. Tell the King that now we must \n                         look to Mordred.\n\n                                     SECOND PEASANT\n                         But we will give you some water...\n\n               At least ten peasants encircle Perceval and he is too \n               exhausted to put up a fight. They grab him and carry him \n               away. Other peasants pull his horse to the ground, and one \n               raises and ax to kill it.\n\n               EXT. STREAM, BARREN LAND - EVENING\n\n               They throw Perceval down an escarpment and he rolls into the \n               fast-moving water. He is swept downstream and thrown \n               ferociously against the rocks in the stream bed, crying out \n               in pain.\n\n               EXT. RIVER AND UNDERWATER - EVENING\n\n               The water is deeper and Perceval is dragged under by the \n               weight of his armor. He struggles desperately to shed it, \n               half drowning.\n\n               Exhausted, he pulls himself up onto the muddy shore beside a \n               rotting sheep carcass, and around him, the daylight dies.\n\n               EXT. RIVER - NIGHT\n\n               Ragged and bruised, lifeless, he stares into space.\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         I have lost my horse, my armor, my \n                         sword. I have lost my way. I have \n                         lost my strength. I have lost \n                         everything... I will not lose hope.\n\n               A light bursting through the trees shines on the mud, \n               wordless, harmonies sound somewhere in the forest. Perceval \n               sets off toward the source.\n\n               The burning light blasts into his face but he doesn't flinch. \n               The chorus builds in power. Before him, a drawbridge lowers.\n\n               EXT. CASTLE GATE - NIGHT\n\n               He steps onto the bridge and walks in. He crosses the \n               courtyard as the drawbridge closes behind him. All details \n               of the castle are bleached out by the searing light.\n\n               EXT. CASTLE GATE - NIGHT\n\n               He steps onto the bridge and walks in. He crosses the \n               courtyard as the drawbridge closes behind him. All details \n               of the castle are bleached out by the searing light.\n\n               INT. CASTLE, VARIOUS\n\n               Heading for the source of the light he ascends what seem to \n               be a staircase. He enters a hall where the chalice stands \n               suspended, burning with light, and the mysterious music swirls \n               and grows.\n\n               Perceval approaches the diaphanous and featureless Figure \n               who stands over the chalice.\n\n                                     FIGURE\n                         Who does it serve?\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         You, my lord.\n\n                                     FIGURE\n                         I have waited long for you.

But \n               they close on nothing, and he draws back. The Figure's hands, \n               although insubstantial, grasp Perceval's and appear to hold \n               his hands around the cup.\n\n                                     FIGURE\n                         But who am I?\n\n               Perceval begins to kneel.\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         You are my lord and King. You are \n                         Arthur.\n\n               The blinding light vanishes, the music drifts away.\n\n               INT. HALL OF THE ROUND TABLE - NIGHT\n\n               Perceval falls to his knees before Arthur and he holds the \n               chalice, now whole again, up to the King. It fills with blood \n               from within and Arthur takes it from Perceval. He drinks. \n               And having done so, he seems to become younger and to grow \n               in strength.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         I didn't know how empty was my soul \n                         until it was filled.\n\n               Sir Kay stands by the vast fireplace where a small fire burns, \n               and only now looks up and is aware of Perceval.\n\n                                     KAY\n                         Perceval, you have returned!\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Ready my knights for battle; they \n                         will ride with their King once more. \n                         I have lived through others far too \n                         long! Lancelot carried my honor and \n                         Guenevere my guilt. My knights have \n                         fought my causes. Mordred carries my \n                         sins. Now, at last, I will rule.\n\n               EXT. WOODS AND FIELDS - NIGHT\n\n               Arthur at the head of a small force of knights, their armor \n               shining beneath the moon, gallops through the land. Where \n               hooves thunder, the ground becomes alive with sprouts and \n               tendrils, and bare trees start to bud, and grasses to blossom, \n               the power of Nature exploding into life.\n\n               INT. CONVENT - DAWN\n\n               An old nun approaches the doors, upon which someone is \n               pounding loudly. She opens the peephole. It is Arthur.\n\n                                     NUN\n                         Go away.

CONVENT COURTYARD - DAWN\n\n               She leads the King, his footsteps ringing in the silent \n               cloister, past the doors to the cells. His armor is wet with \n               dew and it shines with a dull and deep luster. Nuns whisper \n               at his transit. She opens the door to a cell and Arthur steps \n               inside.\n\n               INT. CELL - DAWN\n\n               Candles flicker on a small altar before which a nun is \n               praying. She turns to see who has entered. It is Guenevere, \n               older, thin with self-denial, all the more beautiful. She \n               looks up at the majestic figure who stands before her. She \n               nearly swoons. He helps her to her feet, and words rush from \n               deep within him.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Guenevere, accept my forgiveness, \n                         and put your heart to rest. We have \n                         suffered to long. I have always loved \n                         you, and I still love you.\n\n               She weeps.\n\n                                     GUENEVERE\n                         I loved you much, as King, and \n                         sometimes as husband, but one cannot \n                         gaze too long at the sun in the sky.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I \n                         was not born to live a man's life, \n                         but to be the stuff of future memory. \n                         The fellowship was a brief beginning, \n                         a fair time that cannot be forgotten; \n                         and because it will not be forgotten, \n                         that fair time may come again. Now \n                         once more I must ride with my knights \n                         to defend what was, and the dream of \n                         what could be.\n\n                                     GUENEVERE\n                         I have kept it.\n\n               She draws back the covers of her pallet, and there is \n               Excalibur. Arthur is overwhelmed by emotion; he can barely \n               speak\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         I never dared to hope all these years \n                         that it was in your keeping.\n\n               He kneels before her and kisses her thigh. She gazes off, \n               remembering the life of long ago. He rises and looks off \n               into her eyes, unable to find the words; he finally does.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         I have often thought that in the \n                         hereafter of our lives, when I owe \n                         no more to the future and can be \n                         just a man, that we may meet, and \n                         you will come to me and claim me as \n                         yours, and know that I am your \n                         husband.

He strides \n               forward, Excalibur in hand. He stops and tests its balance, \n               and he draws force from it.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Guenevere...\n\n               EXT.

Kay and Perceval ride at his side. Plumed helmets, \n               shields blazing with armorial colors, pennants flying in the \n               clean wind from their lances; it is a brave sight. The trees \n               are in blossom and dandelion fluff billows up at their \n               passage.\n\n               EXT. PIT, MOORS - DAY\n\n               Arthur's group comes to a halt. Two knights and a few squires \n               galloping from the opposite direction rein in before the \n               King. The knights draw their swords in homage, and the older \n               one addresses Arthur.\n\n                                     KNIGHT\n                         It is only me and my son.

There \n                         are no war tricks that will fool \n                         Mordred. He was weaned on blood.\n\n               He falls on his knees in front of the stone, tired, between \n               thinking and dreaming, and he bangs his mailed fist against \n               it.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         More than I ever did, I need you \n                         now.

CAVE BELOW CAMELOT\n\n               The veins of crystal glow darkly, and the hammering of \n               Arthur's fist upon the stone is dimly echoed here. In the \n               red crystal, fragments of Merlin can be glimpsed, trapped, \n               frozen.\n\n               EXT.

He turns, and is face to \n               face with Merlin, standing over him.

Don't \n                         die.\n\n               He tears off a piece of his tunic and staunches the wound \n               with it.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         My salvation is to die a Knight of \n                         the Round Table.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         You are that and much more. You are \n                         its greatest knight, you are what is \n                         best in men. Now we will be together--\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                         --It is the old wound, that has been \n                         opened. I have always known it would \n                         be the gateway to my death, for it \n                         has never healed. Let my heart do \n                         its job, my King, and pump me empty...\n\n               Arthur takes Lancelot in his arms and rests his lips against \n               the knight's brow.\n\n                                     LANCELOT\n                              (a death whisper)\n                         Guenevere, has she come to you, is \n                         she Queen again?\n\n               He lies, closing his eyes, unable to look at Lancelot.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         She is, Lancelot.\n\n               A boyish smile settles over the features of Lancelot's face, \n               and he dies. Arthur holds him to his breast, his eyes shut \n               tight.\n\n               A strong wind rises. Perceval kneels beside Arthur.\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         The fog is lifting. Only we remain \n                         alive.\n\n               EXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - EVENING\n\n               Arthur and Perceval rise, and as far as they can see across \n               the green hills that roll down to the sea lies the aftermath \n               of the massacre. Hacked bodies, abandoned armor, steaming \n               horse carcasses, everything still. The murmur of the dying \n               is carried on the wind to the soft roar of the sea. The \n               squires have fled the scene of horror.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         But for Mordred. Where is Mordred?\n\n               Elsewhere on the battlefield, Mordred searches the dead, \n               accompanied only by his lieutenant, who turns over the bodies \n               of Arthur's knights.\n\n                                     MORDRED\n                         Where is Arthur?\n\n               One of Arthur's knights reaches out blindly for help. Mordred \n               crushes his skull underfoot. The shaft of his huge lance is \n               caked with blood, as are his hands.\n\n               Arthur and Perceval see Mordred and his lieutenant, and the \n               King restrains Perceval from going forward.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         No, Perceval. Now it is time for me \n                         to raise my sword.\n                              (he bellows out)\n                         Mordred, prepare to meet your death.\n\n               Shield on his left arm, and Excalibur in his right, he starts \n               toward Mordred.\n\n                                     MORDRED\n                         I wait for you, Father.\n\n               Mordred advances forward, the huge spear in both hands and \n               parallel to the ground.\n\n               Arthur goes straight for him, shield ready to receive the \n               blow. Mordred keeps walking, his arms now tensed back and \n               ready to strike.\n\n               Once they are within weapon's reach of each other, Mordred \n               dashes forward and thrusts the spear. It glances off Arthur's \n               shield, slides under his hauberk and penetrates the King's \n               body, and so powerful was the blow that the blade pierces \n               him right through.\n\n               Mortally wounded, Arthur's scream of pain becomes a horrible \n               war cry, and he drives himself forward with all the strength \n               he has along the spear shaft almost to Mordred's hands. \n               Mordred is knocked back and to the ground and Arthur presses \n               down on him, the butt of the spear pinning Mordred. Arthur \n               lifts Excalibur. Mordred attempts to free himself, as the \n               blade of Excalibur descends upon him and cuts through metal, \n               flesh and bone.\n\n               Mordred's head falls to the ground, rolling away.\n\n               Mordred's lieutenant flees. Perceval races to Arthur's side, \n               and supports the King who has fallen on his knees. Arthur \n               speaks through the pain:\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Draw the spear from me. Do it.\n\n               Perceval holds the King tight to himself with one arm, while \n               with the other he draws the shaft through and out of Arthur's \n               body. Arthur sags but doesn't fall. Perceval begins to remove \n               his armor to get at the gaping wounds. The King speaks slowly, \n               softly, from outside his own pain-wracked body.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         There is one thing left to do... \n                         Excalibur... And you must do it, \n                         Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command \n                         you.\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         I cannot--\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         --Take Excalibur. Find a pool of \n                         calm water and throw the sword into \n                         it.\n\n               Perceval, stunned by the command, doesn't move.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         Obey me, Perceval. You must act for \n                         me. It is my last order as your King. \n                         Do it, and be back!\n\n               Perceval picks up the sword, mounts his horse and rides \n               inland. Arthur watches him go, struggling with the pain, \n               still kneeling, and then his head falls to his chest.\n\n               EXT. POOL, MOORS - EVENING\n\n               Perceval steps through tall reeds to the edge of a pool. He \n               cannot bring himself to throw Excalibur into the water. He \n               examines the blade, and it is haloed with a faint iridescence.\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         It is too precious a thing. I can't...\n\n               He backs away from the water and hides the sword in the reeds, \n               and starts back.\n\n               EXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - EVENING\n\n               Perceval dismounts, rushing to kneel at the King's side. \n               Arthur looks up, calm and intense.\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         When you threw it in, what did you \n                         see?\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         ...I saw nothing.\n\n               The King looks at him with piercing power. Perceval blurts \n               it out.\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur \n                         cannot be lost. Other men--\n\n                                     ARTHUR\n                         --By itself it is only a piece of \n                         steel. Its power comes from he who \n                         wields it. For now there is no one. \n                         Do as I have ordered!\n\n               Perceval leaves once more. The daylight is failing, the sun \n               is near the horizon over the sea, bursting through clouds.\n\n               EXT. POOL - EVENING\n\n               He picks up the sword and looks at it for a long time. \n               Finally, with great misgiving, he hurls it into the middle \n               of the pool. As Excalibur is about to touch the water a \n               woman's hand reaches and grasps it by the hilt. It holds the \n               sword aloft for a moment and then draws it under.\n\n               Perceval backs away from the pool stunned by the marvel.\n\n               EXT. MOORS BY THE SEA - SUNSET\n\n               Perceval returns to the King, terribly excited, shouting \n               from his horse:\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         Arthur!\n\n               But Arthur isn't there. Perceval looks around him, he doesn't \n               understand. He sees a trail of blood. He spurs his horse and \n               follows the trail down to the sea.\n\n               EXT. BEACH - SUNSET THEN NIGHT\n\n               There is a trail of blood and prints upon the sand left by a \n               man crawling.\n\n               Perceval follows them toward the sea. He looks around, \n               searching, terribly distraught.\n\n               Where the blood and prints cease, there are many footprints \n               coming from and returning into the sea. Perceval looks out \n               across the waves.\n\n               He sees a sailing vessel rising on the swell. On its deck he \n               can make out the distant figure of Arthur, lying surrounded \n               by women, their gossamer robes rippling in the wind. The sun \n               hovers on the horizon and the ship is heading for it.\n\n               He gallops into the waves until his horse will go no further, \n               calling out with all his strength, a futile attempt:\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         Arthur! Will you return?\n\n               The sun slips below the horizon. Night is falling, and the \n               wind whips the wavecrests. He turns from the sea and wades \n               back.\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         All the knights of the Round Table \n                         are dead. Excalibur is returned. \n                         Arthur is gone. Maybe he lives, maybe \n                         he will return...\n\n               He stops at the edge of the water. In the uncertain light \n               sky and sea become one. He draws the chalice out of a pouch \n               on his saddle, and he holds it up before him.\n\n                                     PERCEVAL\n                         Only I remain, and this...\n\n               The wind swirls and whistles mysteriously in the hollow of \n               the cup. Music grand and melancholic grows from it. The \n               chalice, etched in starlight, is the last thing that is taken \n               from sight in the enfolding darkness.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcalibur\nWriters :   Rospo Pallenberg  John Boorman\nGenres :   Adventure  Drama  Fantasy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n"

The figure gets \nlarger as he approaches. But as yet we cannot tell who he is or \nwhere we are.\n\n\t\t\t\tMALE VOICE (over)\n\t\tThis is the most famous true story\n\t\tof Africa. It happened a hundred\n\t\tyears ago, but even now, when\n\t\tchildren ask about it, you do not\n\t\ttell them at night.\n\t\t\t(The FIGURE continues \n\t\t\tto grow)\n\t\tIt began with the race to build a\n\t\trailroad across Africa.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tBut this is not about building a\n\t\trailroad- it is about Patterson.\n\nAnd now we can tell that the FIGURE is a YOUNG MAN, A LIEUTENANT \nCOLONEL. This is PATTERSON. He is gifted and bright and serious, \nserious about his life, serious about his career. He has been \nsuccessful in everything he's attempted, in part because of his \ntalents, in part because he is willing to outwork anybody.\n\nAND THIS IS WHERE WE ARE: ENGLAND.\n\nMore specifically, in a high-ceilinged corridor of an elegant \nbuilding - lovely woodwork all around. Everything is neat, \neverything is clean and in order.\n\n\t\t\t\tMALE VOICE (over)\n\t\tPatterson was thirty. A brilliant\n\t\tengineer.

Patterson turns, leaves and we\n\nCUT TO\n\nA RAILWAY STATION, IMMEDIATELY AFTER\n\nA train is loading up. A lot of activity, a lot of noise. \nPatterson stands in the midst of it, anxiously looking around.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHELENA PATTERSON, hurrying through the crowd. Early 20s, with the \nkind of serene beauty of Jean Simmons. She is still slim, has not \nbegun to show. She spots him, puts a smile on, goes straight into \nhis arms.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELENA\n\t\tI tried to be late, John- it would\n\t\thave been easier if you'd gone.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(They are nutty about\n\t\t\teach other - he nods)\n\t\tWe're not much good at goodbyes, \n\t\tHelena.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELENA\n\t\t\t(brightly)\n\t\tTell me about Beaumont- does he\n\t\tunderstand how brilliant you are,\n\t\thow lucky he is to have you?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tIt was embarrassing- the man showered\n\t\tme with compliments.\n\nThey start to walk hand in hand along the platform toward a \nquieter place. Patterson is suddenly very serious-\n\n\t\t\t\tHELENA\n\t\tOh dear-\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t-you're geting that downtrodden look\n\t\tagain-\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t-well, it's just...\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t...other men don't abandon their wives\n\t\tat such a time-\n\n\t\t\t\tHELENA\n\t\t\t(not unkindly)\n\t\t-oh please- if I'd been against your\n\t\ttaking this, you would have abandoned\n\t\tme.

Which only means that our\n\t\t\"son\" and I- note my confidence- will\n\t\thave an excuse to come visit.\n\nTHE TRAIN WHISTLE sounds.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELENA\n\t\tGo, now.\n\t\t\t(He kisses her hand)\n\t\tSuch a gentleman.\n\t\t\t(Now he holds her)\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tI am desperate to see Africa- but I\n\t\thate the leaving.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHELENA. She hates it, too.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELENA\n\t\tYou build bridges, John-\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t-you've got to go where the rivers are.\n\nThey hold each other a moment more, then break, then back into \neach other's arms a final time, then-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TRAIN, and thick clouds of steam-\n\n-Patterson runs into the clouds and disappears.\n\nHOLD FOR A MOMENT.\n\nKEEP HOLDING.\n\nPatterson runs out of the steam and we\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nA DIFFERENT TRAIN, A DIFFERENT COUNTRY, A DIFFERENT WORLD.\n\nThis is the train to TSAVO and Patterson is alone on the engine \nseat- a wooden bench in front of the engine used by railroad \ninspectors and visiting VIPs. Behind it is a white circular piece \nof wood used to keep the engine heat from the passengers.\n\nCUT TO\n\nNIGEL STARLING, running as best as he can alongside the train, \ntrying to pull himself up onto the engine seat.\n\nSTARLING is a terribly appealing young man. Clothes do not fit him \nwell, and he is constantly tugging at this sleeve or that \nshirttail, trying to get things right. He wears glasses, tends \nnonetheless to squint at the world. He is, above all, a good man, \nmorally impeccable and very much a product of these Victorian \ntimes.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\t\t(as Patterson helps\n\t\t\thim aboard)\n\t\tMany thanks.\n\t\t\t(squints)\n\t\tYou're Patterson, yes?\n\t\t\t(Patterson nods)\n\t\tNigel Starling- I'll be assisting you\n\t\tat Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must\n\t\thave told you that.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tHe just gave me his \"monster\" speech.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tThat. I know Robert seems dreadful, \n\t\tbut when you truly get to know the man,\n\t\twell, he's much worse.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tAnd I'm one of his defenders.\n\t\t\t(Patterson smiles)\n\t\tForget him for now- it's your first\n\t\tride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it\n\t\tbreathtaking.\n\t\t\t(And on that word-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTARLING coughing like crazy, hands over his face which is caked \nwith dust- he and Patterson stare out at an absolutely dreary \ndesert.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(shouting toward Starling)\n\t\t\"Breathtaking\" doesn't begin to do it\n\t\tjustice.\n\t\t\t(As Starling starts to\n\t\t\tlaugh, his mouth opens\n\t\t\tand sand flies in, and\n\t\t\this coughing fit returns\n\t\t\tand)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DESERT. ENDLESS. LATER IN THE DAY.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TWO OF THEM, bent over, arms covering their faces as the dust \ngets worse- a wind has kicked up.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TRAIN, TRYING TO MAKE IT UP A STEEP GRADE. STILL LATER.\n\nPatterson and Starling are walking beside the train now, helping \nto push it, trudging through the dust. All the other passengers \nspread out behind them, also pushing- the train obviously needs \nall the assistance it can get.\n\nCUT TO\n\nINSIDE A RAILROAD CAR, EARLY EVENING.\n\nPatterson and Starling, filthy, sit together. Starling has nodded \noff. Patterson has a book open in his lap-\n\n-we can tell there are drawings of African animals- not all that \naccurate.\n\nNow Patterson's eyes close and he sleeps.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TRAIN POUNDING THROUGH THE NIGHT.\n\nStokers shovel coal. They are exhausted but they keep at it.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. WAKING IN THE CAR, RUBBING HIS EYES. IT'S DAWN.\n\nHe stares out-\n\n-and from his face it's clear something special has happened. And \nnow, at last-\n\nCUT TO\n\nSOMETHING SPECIAL- and what it is, of course, is Patterson's first \nview of the Africa of his imagination.\n\nBecause the desert has ended, and now there are grasses and trees \nand one more thing-\n\n-bursts of animals. On both sides of the train.\n\nA flock of birds materializes here, a cluster of gazelles doing \nthere amazing leap there.\n\nPatterson is like a kid in a candy store.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND STARLING, back outside in the engine seat again. \nStarling points-\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tAren't they amazing?\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT HE'S POINTING AT: Some giraffes running along, their absurd \nshape suddenly graceful as they eat up the ground in incredibly \nlong strides.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND STARLING, staring out.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tYou know the most amazing thing\n\t\tabout them?- they only sleep five\n\t\tminutes a day.\n\t\t\t(Starling glances at him-\n\t\t\tclearly, he didn't know that)\n\nCUT TO\n\nA FAMILY OF HYENAS. Close by, loping in their scary way.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tDon't much like them.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(nods)\n\t\tThe females are bigger- only animal\n\t\there like that- have to be or they\n\t\twouldn't survive because the males\n\t\teat the young.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTARLING studying Patterson. Clearly, he didn't know that, either.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSOME HIPPOS moving along. Starling turns to Patterson.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tAnything special about them?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tJust that they fart through their\n\t\tmouths.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tMust make kissing something of a\n\t\tgamble.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\tI've lived in Africa a year and I\n\t\tdon't know what you know.

They hold children \nwho wave at the passing train. The children are more impoverished \nlooking than their mothers.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\t\t(suddenly touched)\n\t\tEvery time I see something like that,\n\t\tI know we're right to be here- to\n\t\tbring Christianity into their lives,\n\t\tenrich their souls.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tBeaumont says it's to end slavery.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\t\t(shrugs)\n\t\tWe all have our reasons. Mine is \n\t\tsimply to make them understand \n\t\thappiness, accept salvation, know the \n\t\tserenity that comes-\n\t\t\t(interrupts himself)\n\t\t-best I stop. One of the by-products \n\t\tof my belief is that I can become \n\t\tamazingly boring. But I know God smiles \n\t\ton me.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(They really like each other)\n\t\tHave you got that in writing?\n\t\t\t(Starling, amazingly good\n\t\t\tnatured, laughs. And now-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nA WHITE CLAW.\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nHundreds of white claws.\n\nKEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL\n\nThey aren't claws at all, they're thorns as sharp as claws and \nthey're on a twenty-foot high thorn tree.\n\nAnd there are dozens of those trees, packed together. All mixed in \nwith other trees, low and stunted, and thick underbrush and baked \nred rocks-\n\n-now the train begins to slow.\n\nSmoke drifts across.\n\nA bunch of wildebeest scatter off the tracks.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING (over)\n\t\tWelcome to Tsavo.\n\t\t\t(on the word)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTSAVO.\n\nWe have arrived at the train station area and what we see is a \nplace that is still being built. There are tin shacks; a water \ntower is under construction-\n\n-men are working everywhere, for that's what Tsavo is: a place for \nwork.\n\nTHE TRAIN goes slower still.\n\nNo one stands idly around here.\n\nBut no one looks happy either.\n\nONE MAN is apart from the rest: this is SAMUEL.\n\nAn ageless Masai, tall and slender, he has a smile that can light \nthe world.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND STARLING as they step off the train.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\t\t(indicating Samuel,\n\t\t\twho is approaching)\n\t\tSamuel is camp liaison- absolutely\n\t\tindispensable- the only man here\n\t\teveryone trusts.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(softly)\n\t\tDoes he speak English?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(not softly enough)\n\t\tAnd very poor French.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\t\t(introducing)\n\t\tSamuel- John Patterson.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(as they shake)\n\t\tThe bridgebuilder-\n\t\t\t(gesturing to the \n\t\t\tworking men)\n\t\t-we have been getting ready for \n\t\tyou.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tExcellent. Could I see the bridge\n\t\tsite?\n\t\t\t(Samuel nods)\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tI've got medical supplies to\n\t\tdeliver. Come along to the hospital\n\t\twhen you're done.\n\t\t\t(starting off)\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tI will bring him, Nigel.\n\nWe should realize by now that Samuel's was the voice we heard at \nthe very beginning of the picture.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL, starting to walk. They pass the water tower.\n\nStanding on top of it in a precarious position is an extremely \npowerful INDIAN. He waves to Samuel who waves back. This is SINGH.\n\nWORKERS study Patterson as he moves by. Not smiling. Up ahead, \nsome SIKHS are erecting tents. Not smiling.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tWhy do the workers look unhappy?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tBecause they are here.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tBecause Tsavo is the worst place in\n\t\tthe world.\n\t\t\t(He points ahead)\n\t\tCome, John- to the bridge.\n\t\t\t(And on that-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE RAILROAD TRACKS as the camera pans along.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE RIVER in the distance as they walk toward it.\n\nAnd here is as good a place as any to explain just what the spot \nwhere the movie takes place was like.\n\nThere were five hundred men working for Patterson. And they lived \nin a spread out area. A bunch of Indian coolies who might have \ncome from the same town back in their country might choose to live \nin one cluster of tents. A group of natives might be in another \ncluster.\n\nWhat we have then, as far as living places are concerned, are \ndozens of clusters of tents. (Eventually, as the terror began, \nthese areas all got surrounded, each with its own thorn fence.)\n\nThe places we'll come to know best are, among others, Patterson's \nliving area, the hospital tent area, the area by the river where \nthe bridge is to be built, etc., etc.\n\nAs they move, Samuel points out various camps.\n\nA SECT OF INDIANS is getting ready for prayer.\n\nANOTHER SECT OF INDIANS is eating.\n\nA GROUP OF AFRICANS are cleaning their tent area.\n\nAnyway, you get the idea. Just remember that the place covered a \nwide expanse, maybe a mile square, maybe more.\n\nOkay, back to the story.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(as they pass the INDIAN\n\t\t\ttent area where prayer is\n\t\t\tstarting)\n\t\tIt's all wonderfully under control,\n\t\tSamuel- you've done a splendid job.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tThank you. The truth is this: you\n\t\thave to work at it constantly.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tThe workers don't get on?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tGet on? They detest each other.\n\t\tObviously the Africans hate the\n\t\tIndians. But the Indians also hate\n\t\tthe other Indians. Some of them\n\t\tworship cows, while others eat them.\n\t\t\t(As they move on)\n\nCUT TO\n\nRAILROAD TRACK.\n\nPAN ALONG TO\n\nMORE RAILROAD TRACK.\n\nKEEP PANNING\n\nAnd suddenly the track just stops in mid-air as we\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL standing high above the Tsavo River. The \ntrack has come to the edge of the area above the riverbank- where \nit just stops-\n\n-and picks up on the far side. All that's missing, in other words, \nis the hundred-yard-long bridge that will connect the pieces of \ntrack.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(to the far side)\n\t\tRailhead is across there.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DISTANCE. Nothing can be made out clearly but there are great \nclouds of dust.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tThree thousand men laying track- when\n\t\tthe bridge is done, it all joins up.\n\nPatterson nods, says nothing, but goes to his haunches, staring at \nthe space where the bridge is to be.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tDid it look like this in your mind?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(shakes his head)\n\t\tThis is more difficult-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. CLOSE UP. Excited.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(eyes bright)\n\t\t-but how wonderful that it's \n\t\tdifficult, it should be difficult- \n\t\twhat better job in all the world\n\t\tthan build a bridge?- make things\n\t\tconnect- bring worlds together- and\n\t\tget it right!\n\t\t\t(Now from Patterson-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE HOSPITAL TENT\n\nas Patterson and Samuel walk in. Patterson glances around-\n\n-it's not bad at all. Of course there are some patients, injured \nor with fever. But like the rest of the camp we've just seen, \neverything is working well, everything is under control. Starling \napproaches.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tFinish your tour?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(nods)\n\t\tAnd anxious to get started.\n\t\t\t(indicating the hospital)\n\t\tWhat is this, mostly malaria?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tYes- but their suffering is only\n\t\ttransitory- once they except God\n\t\tinto their hearts, He will vanquish\n\t\tall pain.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN'S VOICE (over)\n\t\tThat's just vomitous talk, Nigel- the\n\t\tpoor bastards will relapse if you keep\n\t\ton that way.\n\t\t\t(As they turn-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nDOCTOR DAVID HAWTHORNE. A tough, middle-aged cockney. And a heavy \ndrinker. A man who hasn't been tactful in twenty years.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWTHORNE\n\t\t\t(to Patterson)\n\t\tI'm David Hawthorne, this is my\n\t\thospital. And my advice to you is,\n\t\t\"don't get sick in front of it.\"\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tThat was meant to be charming, \n\t\tsorry. I seem to have lost the knack.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tYou never had it.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWTHORNE\n\t\tNigel and I don't like each other much.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(breaking the tension)\n\t\tI am also liaison between these two.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(to Hawthorne)\n\t\tClearly you don't agree about building\n\t\tthe railroad?\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWTHORNE\n\t\tThis sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it?\n\t\tIt's only being built to control the\n\t\tivory trade, make men richer.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tThen why do you stay?\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWTHORNE\n\t\tWho else would hire me?\n\t\t\t(to Starling)\n\t\tBeat you to it, didn't I?\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tOh yes, almost forgot- brought you a\n\t\tlittle welcoming gift.\n\t\t\t(Now he gestures and we-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nA NERVOUS ORDERLY who approaches them.

Listening. No emotion on his face.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHAWTHORNE. He's kind of enjoying this. Bearing down.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWTHORNE\n\t\tI know it's your first day and of\n\t\tcourse you must be tired from the\n\t\tjourney-\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t-but what are you going to do about\n\t\tit?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(a long pause, then evenly-)\n\t\tKarim will have to show me where it\n\t\thappened.

And \nthere are half a dozen ORDERLIES.\n\nRight now, Patterson is unpacking, moving in and out of his tent. \nStarling, sipping tea, sits and watches.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tI couldn't believe it when you said\n\t\t\"sort it out.\" As if it were the most\n\t\tnormal thing in the world. \"Ho-hum,\n\t\twhat lovely tea, I think I'll bag a\n\t\tkiller beast this evening, nothing\n\t\tmuch else going on anyway.\"\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tWell, he put me in a spot, didn't he?\n\t\tBut that's all right- after all, I'm\n\t\tresponsible for everything that happens\n\t\there. And it certainly won't do much\n\t\tfor morale if a man-eater's on the prowl.\n\nHe goes into his tent with some books now and we go with him. \nThere is a photo of Helena on a small table. A photo of an ELDERLY \nCOUPLE, clearly his parents. His clothes are stacked with \nprecision.

I know this isn't the time to ask,\n\t\tbut-\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tSince you'd only been here three hours\n\t\twhen we met, are you sure this is how\n\t\tyou hunt lions?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tNot to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse\n\t\tthan you think- I've never even seen one.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTARLING, not pleased with this news. He massages his calf, tries \nto get comfortable, which is impossible. Patterson just stares at \nthe night.\n\nCUT TO\n\nJUST BEFORE DAWN\n\nThe donkey dozes. So does Starling. Patterson has not so much as \nmoved.\n\nNow the bushes behind the donkey shake just a little.\n\nAnd the donkey is suddenly awake and scared-\n\n-and then it all goes crazy- the donkey screams and a lion appears \nfrom the bushes and Patterson fires one shot and the sound \nEXPLODES-\n\n-and Starling topples from the tree to the ground, landing shocked \nbut unhurt-\n\n-he has landed close to the dead lion- he stares at it.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\t\t(amazed)\n\t\t...one shot...\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(even more amazed)\n\t\tSo that's what a lion looks like.\n\t\t\t(Now from the tree-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE HOSPITAL TENT AREA - JUST AFTER DAWN\n\nHOLD for a moment.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL (over)\n\t\tOne shot- one-\n\nKEEP HOLDING\n\nNow Samuel comes walking into the shot, really excited-\n\n-it's the first time we've seen his wonderful smile.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tPatterson has made the nights safe\n\t\tagain.\n\nKEEP HOLDING FOR JUST A MOMENT MORE.\n\nAs he walks on, behind him come THREE COOLIES carrying the body of \nthe lion.

From here, there is a slope down to the \nriver itself.\n\nAlso present is UNGAN SIGNH, who we saw earlier standing \nprecariously atop the water tower. Singh, enormously powerful, is \nanother assistant. Bright, a great worker, another main character \nin what is to follow.\n\nNow Patterson starts to walk down the slope towards the river- \nit's not that easy to do without falling, but that doesn't bother \nhim. He talks and gestures as he explains to the other two who \nmove down with him.\n\nSingh, for all his massive size, moves like a cat. Starling does \nnot, slipping and sliding.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(gesturing)\n\t\tAll right, I'd like to start the\n\t\tembankments today-\n\t\t\t(to Singh)\n\t\t-sufficient supplies on hand?\n\n\t\t\t\tSINGH\n\t\t\t(nods)\n\t\tMore than.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tWith much more on the way-\n\t\t\t(loses balance, falls)\n\t\t-John- we could have had this chat on\n\t\tflatter ground-\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t-true enough- but without the comedy\n\t\trelief.\n\t\t\t(Starling, amazingly good\n\t\t\tnatured, smiles, gets\n\t\t\tback up)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE RIVER as they scramble down to it.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SLOPE they've come down- it's a long way back to the top.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE THREE MEN.

Now, from Starling's perpetually surprised \nface-\n\nCUT TO\n\nSURVEYING EQUIPMENT\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nPATTERSON sighting through it- we are on the far side of the river \nnow. Singh is there, Starling, too.\n\nBehind them: a field of tall grass.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tAll right- thee second embankment\n\t\twill go there.\n\t\t\t(He gestures toward\n\t\t\tthe river)\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tYou do plan to mark it a bit more\n\t\tprecisely than just-\n\t\t\t(imitating Patterson)\n\t\t-\"there.\"\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tIn your honor, Nigel.

He smiles back, starts to reply. But his words stop, his \nsmile dies. He just stares and we-\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT HE'S STARING AT- the surrounding field of tall grass. Nothing \nunusual about it.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. He stares, too.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE FIELD OF TALL GRASS- suddenly it begins to bend and sway in a \nfresh wind.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Silent. As before. Starling follows his glance.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSINGH. Frozen.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE FIELD. And now the field is making odd patterns- as if \nsomething unseen were moving through.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Quiet. Just the wind.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE FIELD. Nothing visible. But the odd pattern seems to be making \nits way across the field.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSINGH AND STARLING. Quiet. Just the wind.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE FIELD. The odd pattern seems to stop. Around it, the wind \nmakes different shapes of the grass.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, as the wind continues to blow. He continues to stare at \nthe spot where the pattern stopped.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSINGH. As before. Except for one thing: suddenly, he begins to \nshiver, as if from cold.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE BUILDING SEQUENCE\n\nAnd what we see are a lot of cuts of a lot of activity.\n\nHuge wooden logs are carried in and hammered to each other and \ndriven deep into the ground- the framework for the embankments.\n\nAnd Singh carries the heaviest loads and leads the workers- and as \nthe structure rises, he is the one darting along the top, high in \nthe air, pulling more logs up, helping here, helping there.\n\nAnd alongside him is his assistant, ABDULLAH, a little man with \nglasses and very bright eyes.\n\nMeanwhile, Starling is leading construction on the embankment that \nis on the far side of the river. And he does his best, tries to \nhelp on the top part as it rises- but alas, he is a bit on the \nclumsy side and balance is a problem for him. But he stays with \nit, does well.\n\nAnd Patterson, in tremendous spirits, helps when needed, but \nmostly he is dealing with other aspects of the bridge- such as the \nplacements of the three stone foundation pillars-\n\n-he wades into the water, climbs the structures, takes it all in- \nand at the start he is still in the uniform he has worn since the \nstart of the story- but it's clumsy for labor-\n\n-so he changes halfway through to civilian clothes-\n\n-which is all he wears from now on.\n\nAnd the workers tire in the heat- but Singh keeps them going, \nworking with the power of three-\n\n-and there are accidents and explosions, injuries and falls- and \nHawthorne appears when needed to help with the wounded-\n\n-it's hard, brutal work-\n\n-but gradually, the wooden structure part is finished- two huge \nskeletons facing each other across the Tsavo River- and now work \non the roadbed is going full blast and in the river, the three \nfoundation pillars are taking shape-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTONS OF RED ROCK- being shoved into the wooden skeleton to \ncomplete the embankments. As this goes on-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL in the river- the foundation pillar work is \ngoing very quickly.\n\nPatterson stops working, looks across the river-\n\n-movement in the grassy area on the far side.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSEVERAL NANDI TRIBESMEN as they rise out of the grass, gesture to \nSamuel who gestures back. The Nandi are a tribe of powerful little \nmen, primitive, with teeth that have been sharpened to points.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL watching them.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tWhat are they looking at?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tYou- they cannot believe you're\n\t\tstill here.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tNonsense.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tYou don't know what Tsavo means, do\n\t\tyou?\n\t\t\t(Patterson doesn't)\n\t\tIt means \"slaughter\"...\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE NANDI TRIBESMEN, staring at Patterson, shaking their heads.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TWO EMBANKMENTS, as more and more red rock is shoved and \npushed into shape.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE THREE FOUNDATION PILLARS- almost finished.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE ROADBED. The same.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE NEAR EMBANKMENT as still more rock is forced in and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE FAR EMBANKMENT done at last-\n\nCUT TO\n\n-and Singh stands on the top of the near one while across the \nriver, Patterson pulls Starling to the top of the other.\n\nAnd they all look at each other- the embankments are both \nfinished- THE THREE OF THEM are flying-\n\n-and what they do is this: hold their hands out toward each other, \nin Singh's gesture. It's kind of become their password.\n\nHOLD. A big moment for them all!\n\nCUT TO\n\nSINGH'S TENT AREA\n\nHe sits around a fire and the man is exhausted. His dinner plate \nis beside him, untouched. He's too tired to eat.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON'S TENT AREA\n\nStarling is there, getting ready for bed. He's wiped out, too.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSINGH, going into his tent, lying down, breathing deep.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTARLING is in his tent, turning out his lamp, half asleep \nalready.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON in his tent, closing his eyes.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSINGH, deep asleep in his tent-\n\n-he shares it with a dozen others and they're all deep asleep. \nThey lie on the floor of the tent, heads together toward the \ncenter pole, feet toward the edges of the tent.\n\nHOLD ON SINGH. It's very dark. HE AND HIS MEN just lie motionless, \nbreathing deeply.\n\nKEEP HOLDING.\n\nNow the CAMERA moves up, high into the center of the tent, looking \ndown at the circle of men.\n\nKEEP HOLDING.\n\nThey don't move, not even an inch. The steady breathing is the \nonly sound.\n\nYES, KEEP HOLDING.\n\nKEEP HOLDING.\n\nNothing is going on down there. Nothing at all.\n\nKEEP HOLDING.\n\nNot a goddamn thing.\n\nKEEP ON HOLDING. KEEP ON HOLDING.\n\nAnd now two things happen at the same time- Singh's eyes go wide-\n\n-and he starts to slide out of the tent, as if being pulled by \nsome giant invisible wire-\n\nCUT TO\n\nSINGH. CLOSE UP. Screaming.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE OTHER MEN IN THE TENT, waking, staring around and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSINGH as he slides out of the tent into the night and his screams \ngrow even louder as we\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE OTHER MEN IN THE TENT and it's like a bomb just went off, they \nrise, spin, cry out, stare-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE NIGHT OUTSIDE AND SINGH'S BODY sliding along the ground. It's \npitch black, and he's going head first now, face upwards and he's \ngoing ast tremendous speed and whatever the hell it is that's \nmaking this happen is something we can't make out- because it's so \ndark and because it's on the far side of the man, and his body is \nin our way and\n\nCUT TO\n\nUP AHEAD, some bushes and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSINGH, his body going faster than before and his cries are \nweakening-\n\n-CUT TO\n\nTHE NIGHT and his body and there is no sound at all coming from \nhim now and there is no sound from whatever it is that is making \nthis happen- all we see, barely, is the limp body of the big man \nas it skims along and-\n\nCUT TO\n\nUP AHEAD NOW, a low clump of bushes.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSINGH'S BODY, coming closer and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE BUSHES and as we get in on them we can tell they are thorn \nbushes and now-\n\nCUT TO\n\nSINGH, suddenly rising magically in the night, his body flying \nover the bushes and gone!\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND STARLING, early morning, their rifles held in front \nof them, racing along, suddenly stopping, staring down and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GROUND. At first we can't make out much. Then we can- a spot \nof red.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND STARLING, hurrying on again.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHORN TREES, and as they force their way through them-\n\nCUT TO\n\nA LARGE VULTURE, wings spread wide as it floats slowly to earth-\n\n-HOLD-\n\n-as it lands we can see A DOZEN OTHER VULTURES are already there, \nsurrounding something-\n\n-but we can't make it out. We are in an area of grass and shadow-\n\n-and specks of blood.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, cries out in shock and fury, fires his rifle, races \nforward.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE VULTURES screeching and screaming, taking off, and as we watch \nthem soar into the morning sky-\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWTHORNE'S VOICE (over)\n\t\tWhat the lion must have done, once \n\t\the'd killed Singh, was lick his skin \n\t\toff so he could drink his blood-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE HOSPITAL\n\nHawthorne is examining Singh's body, trying to be professional, \nbut he's clearly upset- it's awful.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWTHORNE\n\t\t-then he feasted on him, starting\n\t\twith his feet-\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\t\t(evenb more upset)\n\t\t-please- you needn't be so graphic-\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWTHORNE\n\t\tYou intend \"sorting this out\" tonight?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tI'll try- but this feels so different-\n\t\tthat old lion I killed could never\n\t\tcarry off a man Singh's size.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\t\t(maybe a little alarmed)\n\t\tBut you said they were always old.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tThat's what the books say...\n\t\t\t(Now from that-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nFLAMES RISING IN THE DARKENING SKY. NOW-\n\nCUT TO\n\nABDULLAH in tears. Where are we?\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nThis is Singh's funeral pyre.\n\nSingh's body is being burned.\n\nA LOT OF INDIANS are there. We've caught sight of some of them \nbefore- they worked with Singh on the embankment or lived with him \nin his tent.\n\nThere is a terrible sense of shock.\n\nPatterson stands at the rear. He is terribly moved. Now, unseen by \nthe others, he holds his hands out in Singh's gesture one final \ntime.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE FLAMES; they continue to rise...\n\nCUT TO\n\nSINGH'S TENT\n\nNight. The flaps that were open when Singh was alive are now shut \nand tied.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, the middle of the night. He is alone, fifteen feet up \nin a tree near Singh's tent. He holds his rifle, ready for \nanything. He cannot get comfortable.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE AREA- nothing, no movement.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSINGH'S TENT. As before.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE AREA. No sign of movement of any kind. Dead.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE MOON. Lower in the sky. The night is growing to a lose but \nthere is still darkness.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Battling fatigue- but now, for a moment, losing- his \neyes, against his will, start to close, and as they do-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTWO HUGE YELLOW EYES. That's all we see, just the eyes and they \nare near Patterson's tree and they are staring up at him and-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, startled, grabbing his rifle more tightly, staring down \nand-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE HUGE YELLOW EYES- only they're gone.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, blowing on his hands, looking toward the sky.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SUN, RISING, THE NIGHT DONE.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, wrinkled and weary, frustrated and sore, walking back \ntoward his tent area.

They do \nit with care- these are claws-\n\nCUT TO\n\n-STARLING, in charge of another area, and he's not hanging back, \nhe's taking less care than the others, hacking away with his \nmachete, moving in between bushes and\n\nCUT TO\n\nONE OF THE BUSHES, SNAPPING BACK into Starling, and Starling \ntaking the blow with his arms- the claws cut his clothing-\n\n-his arms are starting to bleed-\n\n-he is unmindful, continues to wade into the bushes, chopping at \nthem, cutting them down. He is a good man doing a good thing and \nright now, he is possessed.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, leaving his tent area, lost in thought, going toward \nthe bridge. Up ahead is a grassy area.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GRASSY AREA\n\nFor a moment, nothing. Then there is the same kind of movement we \nsaw with Singh. Something is making the grass move-\n\n-only now there is no wind... HOLD.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Did he see it? We'll never know.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTARLING, in charge of a thorn fence that is halfway finished. His \nclothes are shredded.

They zig-zag this way, that way, \ndodging past each other sometimes they slam into each other, fall, \nget up, run on-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SUN. Falling out of the sky.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE CAMP. The fires rise higher. No one moves... HOLD.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTARLING in the main tent area. He is bathing his bloody hands. \nSamuel is with him.

It's turning into a stunner of a day- \nglorious blue sky broken up by pale clouds.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTARLING. Pauses briefly, listening to the sound of the men.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE MEN WORKING AND SINGING. As before.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GRASSY FIELD. As before-\n\n-except it isn't. Because if you looked carefully, something \nflicked in a 180 degree arc. No telling what it was, it was gone \ntoo quickly.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE MEN WORKING, SINGING ON.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON waist deep in the river, listening to the sound of the \nmen, of the birds.

Now quickly-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON wading out of the river as Samuel comes into view.

Dazed too. He points. Patterson registers, turns and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTARLING, LYING DEAD, his throat ripped open. HOLD briefly on the \nyoung man, then-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE STATION AREA\n\nA train from Mombassa is slowly pulling in. And things are fairly \nchaotic- there is the usual activity of what is ordinarily one of \nthe busier parts in camp-\n\n-but now, something new has been added: Abdullah is there with \nseveral dozen coolies who work under his command. THey are waiting \nfor the train.\n\nPatterson and Samuel are there too- and at the moment, Abdullah \nand Patterson are in the middle of a screamer- first one of them \nwalking away, then coming back, then the other doing the same.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(shouting over the noise\n\t\t\tof the approaching train)\n\t\t-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-\n\t\t\t(gesturing toward the men\n\t\t\twho stand by the train\n\t\t\ttracks)\n\t\t-there's nothing wrong with your men\n\t\tso stop telling me there is-\n\n\t\t\t\tABDULLAH\n\t\t\t(advancing on Patterson now)\n\t\t-you do not call me a liar- you know\n\t\tnothing of their health- consider\n\t\tyourself fortunate I persuaded so \n\t\tmany to stay- consider yourself \n\t\tfortunate I have decided to stay-\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(losing it)\n\t\tYou think you matter?\n\t\t\t(gesturing toward the\n\t\t\ttrain which is close to\n\t\t\tstopping now)\n\t\t-Beaumont is on that train- he \n\t\tmatters-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, moving in on Abdullah now-\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tHe sees this chaos, he'll replace \n\t\tyou all.\n\n\t\t\t\tABDULLAH\n\t\tHe'll replace you, too- that's all \n\t\tyou really care about.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tYou think so?

Listening a moment.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUMONT\n\t\tLovely sound- they seem happy.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tDon't they, though?\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUMONT\n\t\tSo work must be going well?\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON.

Starting to appear more strongly on the horizon.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, running like hell.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE WARRIORS, moving quickly, silently.\n\nCUT TO\n\nA THICK CLUSTER 0F THORN TREES.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, ducking his head, blasting through.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE WARRIORS, starting to cover the entire width of the thicket.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, quickstepping over rocky terrain.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL staying close to Redbeard. The fear is there.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, studying the position of the Warriors, who are almost \nready.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, circling now, racing toward a clearing, picking up \nspeed.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE WARRIORS, spread out. They look to Redbeard.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. Not yet.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, racing into the clearing, glances around- lots of \nanthills.\n\nCUT TO\n\nAN ANTHILL, eight feet high. It casts a long shadow.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Holding Hawthorne's marvelous rifle, he slips silently \ninto the shadow.\n\nHOLD ON PATTERSON- it's almost as if he weren't there.\n\nCUT SHARPLY TO\n\nREDBEARD. CLOSE UP. Suddenly screaming and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, screaming too and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE WHOLE LINE OF WARRIORS, suddenly moving forward, all of them \nshouting and screaming and pounding on their drums and it is loud.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON in the shadow. The noise is faint- but he can hear it.\n\nCUT TO\n\nA DOZEN DRUMMERS, moving forward, banging away.\n\nCUT TO\n\nA DOZEN MORE DRUMMERS, even louder.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, moving forward, his eyes flicking ahead-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE THICKET AHEAD. Nothing. No movement. No lion.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Just the least bit louder now.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE WHOLE LINE OF WARRIORS, screaming and pounding and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL- the fear worse, dogging Redbeard's steps.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. His eyes flicking ahead.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE THICKET AHEAD. Nothing. No movement. No lion.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. It's a lot louder now. He's totally still. And he's \nready.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DENSEST PART OF THE THICKET we've seen yet.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE WARRIORS, slashing their way through, drumming and shouting \nand\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, at their head, eyes, as always, flicking.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE THICKET AHEAD. Nothing. No movement. No lion.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD- starting to suddenly get louder and point-\n\n-because something is there-\n\nCUT BACK TO\n\nTHE THICKET AHEAD, and we didn't see it before, only Redbeard saw \nit before-\n\n-but now something begins to move and\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND THE WARRIORS and it's all going crazy now, and \nthey're starting to move faster and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON IN THE SHADOW.\n\nThe noise has kicked up and all the time it's coming closer and\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND THE WARRIORS and the movement up ahead is more \ndistinct and the Warriors are almost in a frenzy as we\n\nCUT TO\n\nA FLASH OF THE GHOST IN THE THICKET- eyes bright- it starts to \nmove away from the sound-\n\n-and toward where Patterson is waiting.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. Faster, screaming louder and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL and the fear starting to leave and he screams louder too \nand\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON- he fingers the weapon.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, angrily retreating faster from the sound- and now \ninstead of going straight back it begins to veer left and\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, immediately spotting the shift, gesturingto the Warriors \nto get left and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE WARRIORS, shifting over as Redbeard directed, blocking The \nGhost's intended path and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, shifting, trying to go the other way this time and\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD; he spots that too, gestures for the Warriors to shift \nthe other way and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE WARRIORS, racing to thier new positions, blocking the animal's \npath again and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, rattled, upset, and now it starts retreating back in \nthe original direction- toward Patterson and\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND THE WHOLE LONG LINE OF MEN, and it's as if mass \nhysteria has gripped them, because their sound keeps building and \nsure, their throats must ache and yes, their arms must tire, but \nyou couldn't tell that from what they're doing-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Waiting by the anthill. Waiting. Then, at last-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, backing into view, staring back at the sound, unaware \nof Patterson's existence behind him.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Noiselessly he steps away from the anthill into the \nsunlight. He raises Hawthorne's gun.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, backing toward Patterson.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, sighting along the glistening barrel.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, starting to turn.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, ready to fire.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST IN CLOSE UP, CAUGHT IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF THE RIFLE. And \nnow its lips go back as it sees Patterson.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, CLOSE UP, and this is it, this is the moment and as he \nsqueezes the trigger-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND THE GHOST, and a totally unexpected sound- a dull \nsnap- Hawthorne's rifle has misfired.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, unharmed and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON desperately workingthe rifle, trying to make it function \nand\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST. It stares at Patterson.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, and the goddamn gun won't work and he's a dead man and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND THE GHOST-\n\n-and for a moment, they might be frozen in some horrible tableau-\n\n-THEN THE GHOST ROARS-\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD as he hears it, breaking into a wild run-\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tShoot for chrissakes!-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON standing his ground as now THE GHOST takes a step toward \nhim.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, firing, reloading on the move, and up ahead is the \nclearing and as he reaches it-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST. Its great head turns in the direction of Redbeard and\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD's position- anthills block him from getting a clear shot \nat the animal- he curses, races for a better position and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST. One final stare at Patterson-\n\n-then it makes an effortless leap intothe thicket-\n\n-and it's safe and free and gone.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. CLOSE UP. Rocked.\n\nThe low point of his life.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, catching up to Redbeard.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tDid you ever see a lion that size?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tNot even close.\n\t\t\t(Now he moves to\n\t\t\tPatterson)\n\t\tWhat happened?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(a whisper)\n\t\t...misfire... it jammed...\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tHas it ever done that before?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t...don't know...\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tIt's Hawthorne's.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. Trying for control.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tYou exchanged weapons?\n\t\t\t(Patterson nods)\n\t\tYou went into battle with an\n\t\tuntried gun?\n\t\t\t(Patterson nods)\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. CLOSE UP. For a moment it's impossible to tell what he's \ngoing to do. It seems that a Homeric burst of fury is about to \nhappen.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Drained, he epects it. It's very quiet.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREEDBEARD, studying the younger man. And when he finally speaks, \nhis voice is surprisingly quiet.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tThey have an expression in\n\t\tprizefighting: \"everyone has a plan\n\t\tuntil they're hit.\"\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tYou've just been hit...\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t...the getting up is up to you...\n\t\t\t(And he turns, moves\n\t\t\toff and)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE NEW HOSPITAL.\n\nNearly finished. The fence is eight feet high and Hawthorne is \nsupervising men and material that are being transferred.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, checking security in the New Hospital which is close to \nthe center of camp. (The Old Hospital was situated on the \noutskirts, because they wanted to keep the workers away from the \nsick and the wounded.) Late afternoon, now.\n\nPatterson, Samuel and Hawthorne are moving with him. As are TWO \nEXPERIENCED ORDERLIES, both armed with powerful rifles. Patterson \nis silent here, the effects of the misfire still evident on his \nface.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(to the Orderlies)\n\t\tGentlemen, there's no sickness smell\n\t\tat all here, and little blood. When\n\t\twe leave, close the gate securely,\n\t\tdon't open it til morning and keep\n\t\tyour fires high. Any questions, ask\n\t\tthem now.\n\t\t\t(They understand- now\n\t\t\tto Samuel and Hawthorne)\n\t\tYou two will sleep beautifully in\n\t\tyour tents.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tAnd stay there.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tAnd where will you sleep beautifully?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(smile)\n\t\tPatterson and I will be in the old\n\t\thospital- where the enticing smell\n\t\tof sickness still lingers-\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t-and by the time we're done, I\n\t\tpromise you, the odor of blood will\n\t\tbe irresistible.\n\t\t\t(And on that-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE OLD HOSPITAL. STARTING TO GET DARK.\n\nRedbeard and Patterson have buckets which they empty around the \ninside perimeter-\n\n-buckets of blood.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD. Darker. They empty still more full buckets \nof blood. Redbeard seems pleased.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL AND HAWTHORNE, hurrying toward their camp.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, leading Masai cattle into the grounds of \nthe Old Hospital.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE ORDERLIES IN THE NEW HOSPITAL, firmly closing and locking the \ngate.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, just outside the fence of the Old \nHospital- they carry many large chunks of raw meat, drop them as \nthey move.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SUN. Dying... dying...\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD. They slip inside the deserted Old \nHospital, pull the gate securely shut.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE CATTLE. They stand in the center of the Old Hospital, calling \nto each other.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE NEW HOSPITAL. Full. Clean. The men are exhausted. Most are \nalready asleep. The Orderlies sit by a fire, alert for anything.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE OLD HOSPITAL. Patterson and Redbeard stand across from their \nfire, waiting. The cows are quiet.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHAWTHORNE by his fire near his tent with Samuel. Nervously, they \ndrink tea.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE MOON. Higher. An hour has passed. Perhaps more.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. Walking the fence perimeter.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. The cows are edgy. He calms the cows.\n\nCUT TO\n\nOUTSIDE THE OLD HOSPITAL. The large chunks of meat are visible in \nthe moonlight.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE NEW HOSPITAL. The orderlies are calm.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, still walking the perimeter.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON sitting by the fire, staring at the night. Redbeard \nmoves to him, speaks in a whisper.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tThink about something else.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tHave you ever failed?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(sad smile)\n\t\tOnly in life...\n\t\t\t(He walks away.\n\t\t\tPatterson watches.)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE NEW HOSPITAL. The Orderlies tend the sick. Quietly.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE NIGHT AND THE MOON. Lovely.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. Stalking the perimeter. No sound. The night is deadly \nquiet.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. He stalks the perimeter now too, on the far side from \nRedbeard- and suddenly a different and frightening sound- the \nripping of flesh-\n\nCAMERA MOVES UP\n\nNow we can see both Patterson inside and also outside where, in \nshadow, The Ghost and The Darkness are devouring a hunk of meat.\n\nRedbeard moves quickly across the perimeter, gestures for \nPatterson to switch positions with him.\n\nAs he reaches where Patterson was, the eating sound stops.\n\nSilence again.\n\nPatterson reaches the far side of the fence.\n\nNow the eating sound comes again, and again, BOTH LIONS are \noutside, directly across from Patterson.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD looks across the perimeter at Patterson. Whatever's going \non, it's sure as hell odd.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE CATTLE- they are very upset suddenly- one of them kicks out \nviolently against the night- the same gesture the cattle did just \nbefore The Ghost walked through their pen and killed one-\n\n-now a different sound is heard: scratching-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD tracking the sound-\n\n-the main gate is starting to be pushed in. Inside the gate the \nground is covered with blood stains from where they emptied their \nbuckets.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GATE. More pressure against it- it could give way any moment.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON and from the look on Redbeard's face, this \nis it! Patterson seees this, readies his rifle and we-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE CATTLE, going nuts and then-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GATE. All pressure gone.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD. Patterson is furious.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tGoddammit!\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tIt's all right. Stay ready.\n\t\t\t(indicates the blood)\n\t\tThey know it's there.\n\nPatterson takes a few steps away, stares at the moon.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD; he studies Patterson who so clearly craves redemption.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(going to him)\n\t\tMeant to ask you- the railroad car\n\t\ttrap. Your idea?\n\t\t\t(Patterson nods)\n\t\tExcellent notion- I used the same\n\t\tdevice myself once.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tBut of course yours worked.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tIn point of fact it didn't- but I'm\n\t\tconvinced the idea is sound.\n\nHe goes back to walking the perimeter. Patterson watches him- and \nfor the first time since the misfire, Patterson's mood begins to \nlift.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE NEW HOSPITAL\n\nand an ORDERLY, blood pouring from his throat as he lies by the \nfire and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SECOND ORDERLY rounding a corner, seeing the violence; before \nhe can scream-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS suddenly beside him, and their giant \npaws slap out so fast we can't follow and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SECOND ORDERLY, dropping to the ground, and now we're starting \nto spin into madness and these next cuts go like lightning.\n\nCUT TO\n\nA TENT FULL OF SICK MEN with malaria and\n\nCUT TO\n\nA PAW flashing and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, lips pulling back and\n\nCUT TO\n\nA SICK MAN, falling from his bed, blood pouring from his slashed \nface and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTWO MORE SICK MEN, trying to rise and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, leaping on them and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, eyes narrow and brilliant and\n\nCUT TO\n\nA SICK COOLIE, and he's terrified and he tries to scream-\n\n-the sound barely escapes him, but even so, it's the first cry \nwe've heard and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE ENTIRE CAMP, NIGHT, WITH ALL THE FIRES BURNING- AND \nPATTERSON'S TENT AREA IS CLOSE BY-\n\n-but the New Hospital is on the other end, a good distance away.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, rifles ready- but no sound reaches them.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHAWTHORNE, out of his tent, because he's close by and he heard it \nand he lights a torch, starts for the gate of the camp as Samuel \ndoes his best to stop him-\n\n-but Hawthorne rips free and we\n\nCUT TO\n\nA SECOND TENT, as it starts to collapse and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE MEDICINE TENT, as The Ghost and The Darkness enter and\n\nCUT TO\n\nMEDICINE, flying across the tent and\n\nCUT TO\n\nGLASS, shattering and more medicine is destroyed and\n\nCUT TO\n\nA BLIZZARD OF CUTS, of lions' claws and lions' teeth and those \nterrible bright blazing eyes and\n\nCUT TO\n\nA TENT POLE, being pulled out of the ground and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS and what they are doing is this: \ndestroying the New Hospital and\n\nCUT TO\n\nMORE TENTS collapsing and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS. CLOSE UP. Eyes crazed.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHAWTHORNE ALONE IN THE NIGHT, scared shitless as he runs.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSHADOWS, moving, as Hawthorne's torch lights the surroundings and\n\nCUT TO\n\nHAWTHORNE, heart pounding, looking around and then he gasps as we\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE AREA NEARBY- TWO LARGE EYES are staring at him.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHAWTHORNE, panicked, stumbling, falling, getting up, staring \naround-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE AREA AROUND HIM- the eys are gone-\n\n-and now there are loud shrieks in the night coming from the New \nHospital and the instant they are heard\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON, grabbing torches, throwing the gate open \nand they're off as we\n\nCUT TO\n\nHAWTHORNE, running toward the New Hospital just up ahead now.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, tearing through the night.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE NEW HOSPITAL. (We see all this next through Hawthorne's eyes.) \nThe tents are all down. The place is devastated.\n\nCUT TO\n\nINSIDE THE FIRST TENT. Filled with the dead and the dying.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHAWTHORNE. Ashen. Moving on.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPAN ALONG THE TENT\n\nDead. Blood. Pain.\n\nPAN TO THE SECOND TENT\n\nMore dead.\n\nMore dying.\n\nIt's a slaughterhouse.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHAWTHORNE. He's crushed. His body sags. He takes a breath, his \nlast.\n\nTHE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS are on him, roaring.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD as the roar reverberates- they glance at \neach other-\n\n-then they slow.\n\nBecause the New Hospital has come into view.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, CLOSE UP, staring at the disaster.\n\nAnd this terrible crosses his face. For a moment, you think he's \ngoing to fall. His body seems drained of all its power. He stands \nthere. Just stands there. Unable to move.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. And he does move. Slowly. Carefully. Into the chaos.\n\nHe stares around- the dead and the dying are everywhere. \nHawthorne, his face clawed almost unrecognizably, lies alone.\n\nAll that's left now is this: the sound of pain.\n\nHOLD.\n\nDust rises. It covers everything. Only the sound remains.\n\nNow different sounds take over-\n\n-an incredible babble of human voices.\n\nAND A RAILROAD TRAIN.\n\nPatterson walks through the dust. Samuel, a worried look on his \nface, is a few steps behind.\n\nWe are at the STATION AREA and it is jammed. A train has pulled \ninto the station-\n\n-only you almost can't tell it's a train: all you can see are \nworkers climbing up, and the inside is full so the workers clamber \nup onto the roofs of the cars-\n\n-covering the cars-\n\n-everyone is leaving-\n\n-Patterson can only watch.\n\nAbdullah stands on one of the cars-\n\n-the train begins to pull out of the station.\n\nMore and more workers chase after it, get pulled on.\n\nNow the station area is empty, the flat car roofs full.\n\nPatterson still watches, eyes vacant.\n\nAbdullah sees him, looks away.\n\nThe train gathers speed.\n\nRounds a corner...\n\n...gone...\n\nPatterson turns from the scene, begins to walk. Samuel stays close \nbehind him, the worried look still there.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE OLD HOSPITAL.\n\nA FEW AFRICAN ORDERLIES do the best they can. Patterson watches \nonly a moment, walks on. Samuel still behind him.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE CAMP as Patterson walks through. A ghost town now. Only \nAfricans remain.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE CONTRAPTION where the coolies missed The Darkness. Patterson \nlooks at it a moment, walks on.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE ANTHILL IN THE CLEARING where Patterson misfired. Patterson \nlooks at it a moment, walks on. And now, at last-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON'S TENT AREA. One or two Africans. Samuel darts into his \ntent, emerges with something, holds it out to Patterson.\n\nIT'S A NECKLACE OF LION CLAWS.\n\nPatterson makes an almost courtly bow of thanks, puts it on- he \nnever takes it off again. He walks on alone now until at last-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE BRIDGE.\n\nIt stops abruptly, halfway done; the foundations are in place, a \nlot of the scaffolding, but it's useless. Late afternoon. \nDesolate.\n\nRedbeard sits alone, high on one of the foundations. He looks as \nhe did the night before.\n\nPatterson walks to the top of the near embankment. He is unshaven, \nwrinkled, he fingers the lion claw necklace.\n\nFor a moment, neither says a word. Then-\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(out of the blue)\n\t\tIt would have been a beautiful \n\t\tbridge, John. I never noticed \n\t\tbefore, occupied with other \n\t\tbusiness, I\tsuppose...\n\t\t\t(He's rambling)\n\t\t...never really pay much attention\n\t\tto that kind of thing but I've had\n\t\tthe time today, nothing else on,\n\t\tand this... it's graceful and the\n\t\tplacement couldn't be prettier...\n\t\tand...\n\t\t\t(He goes silent now,\n\t\t\tstares off)\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tYou just got hit.\n\t\t\t(Redbeard nods)\n\t\tThe getting up is up to you- but\n\t\tthey're only lions-\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t-and I'm going after them crack\n\t\tof dawn...\n\t\t\t(And on that-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nA LONG SHOT OF A HIGH ROCKY CLIFF-\n\n-we haven't seen anything like it before- it's hundreds of feet \ntall- gorgeous early morning light.\n\nAs we watch, we realize there are two dots on the side of the \ncliff.\n\nAs we watch a moment more, we realize the dots are moving.\n\nCAMERA MOVES CLOSER.\n\nTHE DOTS are Patterson and Redbeard, working their way along the \nrock face. Patterson is much more nimble. It's dangerous, of \ncourse, but neither of them seems to have that uppermost in mind. \nThey travel lightly- small knapsacks and their weapons.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TWO OF THEM as they make it over the cliff face. They stand, \nstare out.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THEY SEE: the world. They move on.\n\nCUT TO\n\nA RAVINE. They are moving along the edge. It's tricky going- if \nyou fell you wouldn't much like it. They are both concentrating on \ntheir movements, paying no attention to each other as Redbeard \nstarts to speak. They don't stop moving.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tIn my town, when I was little,\n\t\tthere was a brute, a bully who\n\t\tterrorized the place.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tBut he was not the problem. He\n\t\thad a brother who was worse than\n\t\the. But the brother was not the\n\t\tproblem.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tOne or the other of them was\n\t\tusually in jail. The problem came\n\t\twhen they were both free togther.\n\t\tThe two became different from\n\t\teither alone.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tAlone they were only brutes.\n\t\tTogether they became lethal,\n\t\ttogether they killed.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tWhat happened to them?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tI got big.\n\t\t\t(They move on)\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD working their way up a steep ravine. It's \nhard going. They help each other.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving along the edge of the ravine now. \nSlow. Silent. Redbeard stops, points-\n\nCUT TO\n\nA TANGLE IN THE BUSHES AND THORNS with one odd thing about it: \nthere is a clearly defined archway, as if a buffalo or rhino used \nit as a regular passage.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TWO OF THEM at the archway. They look at each other, without a \nword move through it.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE OTHER SIDE. A small clearing. And at the end of the clearing: \na cave.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE CAVE MOUTH. Dark.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON. They each check their guns, move toward \nit.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE CAVE MOUTH. Closer. Suddenly it's getting eerie.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, moving slowly, Patterson right with him.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE CAVE MOUTH. They're by it- Redbeard squints inside.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT HE SEES: it's dark and dangerous and there is a long low \ntunnel you have to half-crawl through.\n\nWithout a word, they start inside.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON, crouched low, moving through the tunnel. \nAhead there is light. They move on.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE END OF THE TUNNEL- they can see the cave beyond.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON. They glance down. Nothing much there- just \na copper bracelet, the kind a native might wear.\n\nNow they move past it and as the tunnel ends, they stand up.\n\nCUT TO\n\nINSIDE THE CAVE - IT'S BIG.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving deeper into the cave. It's scary- \ndark with shafts of light coming from cracks in the rock. It's \ndank. It all feels as at any moment, the world could end.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. CLOSE UP. Thunderstruck-\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tDear God-\n\t\t\t(And on those words-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE FLOOR OF THE CAVE. More copper bracelets. And still more-\n\n-and now bones-\n\n-the floor of the place is littered with human bones-\n\n-eyeless skulls peer up at them from all around.\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nThe rest of the cave. We are looking at a carpet of bones.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tTheir den?\n\t\t\t(Redbeard nods)\n\t\tHave you ever seen anything like\n\t\tthis?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tNobody's seen anything like this.\n\t\tLions don't have caves like this-\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t-they're doing it for pleasure.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSEVERAL TUNNELS, dark and ominous, leading from the cave-\n\n-and now there is a sound from one of the tunnels-\n\n-something is coming close and coming fast and\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON as Redbeard fires into the tunnel and the \nsound explodes-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TUNNEL-\n\n-shrieks-\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON. What the hell is it?\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TUNNEL- and here they come, screeching and angry-\n\n-bats-\n\n-swarms of them- hundreds of them-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, diving to the ground, lying there amidst \nthe bangles and the bones and the skulls-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE BATS. Circling above them. Screeching louder.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, lying very still, eyeless skulls all \naround, staring.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE BATS. For a moment, it seems as if they might attack.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTRSON AND REDBEARD. Waiting, waiting. Then-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE BATS  back into the tunnel and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, scrambling to their feet.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tOne of my chief attributes is that\n\t\tI'm always calm.\n\nAnd then without warning, from behind them, a roar-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD spin around, start back toward the entrance \nof the cave-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE LOW ENTRANCE TUNNEL as they scramble half-crawling through it.\n\nCUT TO\n\nOUTSIDE as they make it, stand straight, look around-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHICK BUSH beyond- another roar and sudden movement and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, entering the thick bush- but carefully, \nbecause they are vulnerable now and an attack could come from \nanywhere- there is the sound of water-\n\n-slashes of light hit their eyes, making it hard to see- and \nthey're totally vulnerable now but it doesn't stop them- the water \nsound gets stronger- and as they burst clear-\n\nCUT TO\n\nAN AMAZING PLACE- AN AREA OF FLAT ROCK SPLIT UP AHEAD BY A WIDE \nFAST-RUNNING WATERFALL.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD. They look around. Nothing is there. But \nthe spot is wide open, exposed.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(The words pour out)\n\t\tWhere could it have gone? How\n\t\tcould it get across the water?\n\t\t\t(looks at Redbeard)\n\t\tThey're only lions, yes?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(shakes his head; he\n\t\t\tdoesn't know)\n\t\tDon't they have to be?...\n\nThey look around a moment more. Nothing to see-\n\n-they turn, leave, re-enter the thick bush. And now-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS- who knows where it is but it's there-\n\n-watching Patterson.\n\nHOLD BRIEFLY on The Darkness, then-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON'S TENT AREA. JUST BEFORE DAWN-\n\n-outside the fence a dreadful sound- the crunching of bones.\n\nPatterson, Redbeard, and Samuel emerge from tents, listen. \nPatterson is on one side of the area, Redbeard and Samuel on the \nother.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(pointing)\n\t\tBoth of them over there.\n\nHe is pointing to Patterson's area. Patterson goes to Redbeard.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tEver have to use a machan?\n\t\t\t(Redbeard hasn't)\n\t\tI did once. In India. We will \n\t\ttonight.\n\t\t\t(Now from that-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nA CLEARING. LATER IN THE DAY.\n\nPatterson leads the few remaining men in constructing an odd \nlooking structure: four slender poles lashed together, slanting \ninward with a plank tied on top, a dozen feet up in the air. \nRedbeard and Samuel approach.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tThey're used to people in trees,\n\t\tnot in a clearing.\n\t\t\t(indicating the plank)\n\t\tIt may be tight.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tNot for me- I'm too bulky and it's\n\t\tyour idea, you go up there.\n\t\t\t(to Samuel)\n\t\tTake the others to the water tower\n\t\tfor the night.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tI'll be bait alone?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tYes. And I'll be in some distant\n\t\ttree where I can provide no\n\t\tassistance whatsoever.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tCan you control your fear?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tI'll have to.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tI can't control mine- I'd be lost\n\t\twithout the shame factor driving me.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tWas that supposed to make me feel\n\t\tbetter?\n\t\t\t(Redbeard doesn't\n\t\t\treply. Now-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nA DONKEY BEING LED IN. LATER.\n\nTHE MEN start to tie it down, across the clearing from the machan.\n\nPatterson takes a long look at the machan. He tests the support \npoles- they're rickety.\n\nCUT TO\n\nDUSK. The sun quickly beginning its quick fall.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE WATER TOWER IN THE STATION AREA. Samuel is with the remaining \nmen who clamber up to the platform on top.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DONKEY IN THE CLEARING. Quiet.\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nRedbeard, holding a wooden ladder that is propped against the \nplank. Patterson climbs his slow way up. It's dangerous.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE PLANK as Patterson makes it, clambers off the ladder, manages \nto sit.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE VIEW. Nothing is around the machan. He is totally vulnerable.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, taking the ladder down. Patterson tries to get \ncomfortable. He can't.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(glancing around)\n\t\tIt's certainly the best chance\n\t\tthey've had to kill you.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tYou think they'll come then?\n\t\t\t(Redbeard does)\n\t\tWhy?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(not answering)\n\t\tGood luck.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tWhy?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tBecause I think they're after you.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. This registers. Finally, he nods. Redbeard starts to \nleave.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tHow many do you think they've \n\t\tkilled?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(reluctantly)\n\t\tThe most of any lions... a \n\t\thundred...?\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tProbably more.\n\t\t\t(Now Redbeard looks\n\t\t\tup at the younger man)\n\t\tJohnny...?\n\nThey study each other in the gathering darkness. They've been \nthrough a lot together, these two. They're not what they were when \nthey first met. An emotional moment clearly is at hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tDon't fuck up.\n\t\t\t(And he turns, never\n\t\t\tlooks back, just goes)\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. He is alone now.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSHADOWS. Growing longer.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL. On top of the water tower. The remaining men are with him.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DONKEY. It peers around.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. His fingers move slowly along his rifle barrel-\n\n-there is no noise- but you have the sense that, at any second, \nthe world could explode.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE EDGE OF THE CLEARING, a good distance away. A bunch of trees. \nNothing unusual.\n\nMOVE IN CLOSER:\n\nRedbeard, motionless, rifle in hand, is high in the branches.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SUN. About to die.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, trying to get comfortable. It's not possible.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DONKEY, tethered, but able to move.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, testing the machan- not a good idea- it trembles. He \nstops, stares out at the setting sun, the light hitting his skin, \ngiving it color.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SUN and here's the thing about Africa- the sun doesn't just \nset, it literally drops out of the sky. Suddenly it's bright and \nin a blink it isn't. As it drops-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. CLOSE UP. It's madness that he's up here. And he knows \nit. And that shows.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SKY. No moon. Just thick cloud.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DONKEY. Quiet.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. On his precarious perch. He scans constantly ahead of \nhim past the donkey.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE THICK BUSH BEYOND THE DONKEY. Nothing moves-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. He swallows, moistening his throat. He stares down at \nthe donkey.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DONKEY. LATER. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. DARK.\n\nAnd now, just the beginning of a mist.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SKY. THICKER AND THICKER CLOUDS. LATER STILL. GETTING TOWARD \nMORNING.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON sitting there twelve feet up as the silence extends, \nlistening for something, anything-\n\n-but all there is is silence.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DONKEY. It lies still and quiet.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, looking around- you get the feeling he'd like to \nscream.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE BUSHES AROUND HIM. The mist is getting stronger.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD in his tree, cursing, trying to see through the growing \nmist.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, listening, listening-\n\n-and then there is a sound and it's so quiet you can barely hear \nit but to Patterson it might as well be thunder-\n\n-from behind the donkey there has come this: the snapping of a \ntwig.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DONKEY, and it's eyes widen-\n\nHOLD ON THE DONKEY.\n\nBecause now something happens that hasn't happened before: \nsuddenly there are no colors, only tones-\n\n-because lions can't see colors, only tones, and that's what's \nhappening- we are looking at the donkey from the point of view of \nthe lion-\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nTHE EYES OF THE GHOST. Watching the donkey.\n\nAnd from now on, when we are using PATTERSON'S POINT OF VIEW, \neverything is clouded and thick with mist, and sounds are muted.\n\nWhen we are using THE GHOST'S POINT OF VIEW, everything is totally \nclear- and sounds are thunderous.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT PATTERSON SEES: just mist and vaguely, bushes.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: The donkey. And CAMERA begins to move closer \nas The Ghost moves, just the barest few steps closer.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Still no sound- but beyond the donkey there seems to be \nsome movement in the bushes.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: The donkey, very, very close-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Squinting desperately at the area beyond the donkey but \nthe mist is so thick, he can't make certain of anything.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: THE DONKEY.\n\nHOLD.\n\nNow there is something else visible, something behind the donkey: \nthe four legs of the platform.\n\nHOLD.\n\nNow we travel up the platform- the four legs grow closer together.\n\nHOLD AS THE GHOST AT LAST SEES PATTERSON.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE EYES OF THE GHOST. NARROWING.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Involuntarily, a shiver.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, but the angle shifts-\n\n-what's happening of course is this: The Ghost is circling around \nthe platform in the safety of the bushes and the mist.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, following the whispered sound of the bushes moving. He \nhalf turns the other way quickly, making sure that nothing is \nbehind him.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON shifting as the angle continues to \nchange.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON as the realization hits: the beast doesn't care about \nthe donkey anymore, it's stalking him.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. In the tree. The mist obscures everything.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Still circling, still closer.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, and it's scary now, this thing circling and circling, \nalways closer, never visible and his throat is dry and you know \nhe's just dying to blast it with his weapon or scream for it to do \nanything but this constantly circling movement. (In truth, the \nlion circled him for two hours, always coming closer, never quite \nseen.)\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, always the circling around.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, trying to turn on his shaky plank, trying to never to \nlet the animal's position out of his sight.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer...\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, staring, staring at the goddamn mist, about to come \napart now with the tension as it builds and builds and builds and\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, gripping his weapon tightly as his head keeps on \nturning.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, suddenly yelling out loud as an owl lands on him- \nthat's right, a goddamn owl landed on him, thinking he was a tree, \nalmost knocking him off the plank and\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, starting to slip off the platform \nand\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, fighting the owl away, but his balance is going and \nhe's trying not to fall and\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, beginning to topple off and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, helpless, balance going, going-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, starting to charge forward and Christ he can move and \nas he starts his leap-\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, racing from the tree to the edge of the clearing, firing \nhis rifle, firing again and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, as this incredible roar comes from him, and he spins, \nlands, and sure, he's been hit but he's gone, back into the bushes \nand the night has him and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSUDDEN DAWN AND PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, running, stopping, staring \nat the ground-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GROUND. Blood.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving quickly forward again-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GROUND. More blood and...\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TWO OF THEM, starting to slow-\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTRANGE TERRAIN- huge anthills all over, the tallest we've seen, \nsome of them fifteen feet high, some even higher.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD. They separate, take different paths \nthrough the anthills.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. Alert. One step at a time.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. The same. One step at at time.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST. Crouched high up behind one of the biggest anthills, \nstaring down at them both.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. He gestures for them to stop. They do. For a moment they \nmight be statues.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE ROCKY GROUND. Spots of blood. Redbeard kneels to examine them \nand as he does-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, launched in mid-air and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, whirling, falling, firing and as the sound detonates-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, in mid-air, body twisted and-\n\n-and FREEZE.\n\nFreeze on The Ghost silhouetted against the morning sky.\n\nHOLD. THen-\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, WALKING INTO THE SHOT-\n\n-we're by the river and this is a repeat of the earlier moment \nwhen the three men brought the old man-eater into camp-\n\n-only now eight men appear, carrying The Ghost- eight is the \nactual number of men that it took, and as they lower the dead \nanimal to the ground-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST- and now there's a flash of light as we\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nBEAUMONT, kneeling by the dead animal. He is smiling beautifully, \nand there is no questioning the look of triumph on his face.\n\nCUT TO\n\nA PHOTOGRAPHER; loads of bulky equipment. Patterson and Redbeard \nstand behind him, watching him. We're in a lovely spot by the \nriver. Patterson and Redbeard have definitely been drinking.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUMONT\n\t\tI think another for posterity-\n\t\tthis is an important moment in\n\t\tmy life.\n\nHe strikes another pose- the Photographer goes to work.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUMONT\n\t\tUnderstand, I had help-\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t-not a time for modesty, Bob-\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t-undeniably your triumph.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUMONT\n\t\tOh surely there's enough credit\n\t\tfor us all- let's not forget, you\n\t\tdid the actual shooting. Of course,\n\t\tI hired you, I was the general who\n\t\tput the team together. And generals\n\t\tare the ones who tend to be\n\t\tremembered.\n\n\t\t\t\tPHOTOGRAPHER\n\t\tPerhaps you might put your head in\n\t\tits mouth, sir- could be a corker.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUMONT\n\t\tClever idea, I like it.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE MOUTH OF THE GHOST- it is huge-\n\n-Beaumont manages to get it open- puts his head between the \nenormous set of teeth- he's nervous, tries to hide it when we\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD suddenly giving a loud imitation of a lion roaring and\n\nCUT TO\n\nBEAUMONT, surprised and frightened-\n\n-he jerks his head away-\n\n-there is the sound of laughter, Patterson's and Redbeard's-\n\n-Beaumont tries for his smile, can't bring it off, looks around, \nhumiliated, and as the laughter builds-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TENT AREA. NIGHT.\n\nPatterson and Redbeard flank a fire. It's a sweet moment for them, \ntheir first, no fear in the vicinity.\n\nIt should be noted that they both are drinking from bottles of \nchampagne.\n\nIt should also be noted that the Patterson we see is a world away \nfrom the young man who went to meet Beaumont. He's unshaven, his \neyes have seen terrible things, he is weary, he has known failure- \nhe is more at ease with the world.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(drunk)\n\t\tI never thought I'd say this, but\n\t\tI'm glad you came.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(drunk)\n\t\tUnderstood- you realize now you\n\t\tcould never have done it without\n\t\tme.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tActually, I could have done it\n\t\tmuch more easily without you, but\n\t\tfor whatever reason, I'm glad you\n\t\tcame.\n\t\t\t(They toast each other)\n\nSamuel, with his own bottle of champagne has wandered over, joins \nthem.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(drunk)\n\t\tWhere do you go next?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tSome Russian princes want to hunt\n\t\tthe Himalayas.

Then-\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tThree years I've worked for the\n\t\trailroad. Now I don't know why. It\n\t\tseemed a good idea once.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tI feel the same about the bridge.\n\t\tThis country certainly didn't ask\n\t\tfor it, doesn't need it.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tToo soon to tell.\n\nThey look at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tMy life was shaped because someone\n\t\tinvented gunpowder. Our lives have\n\t\tcrossed because two lions went mad.\n\t\tBut what if in the future the three\n\t\tof us do something grand for\n\t\thumanity? Was that worth all the\n\t\tlives? Too soon to tell.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(drinks)\n\t\tSome mysteries should not have \n\t\tsolutions.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(finishes his bottle,\n\t\t\trises, looks at Patterson)\n\t\tHold your son high.\n\t\t\t(And he turns, goes\n\t\t\tto his tent)\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(beat- quietly)\n\t\tHe has children?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(beat- quietly)\n\t\tOnce...\n\t\t\t(HOLD on the two\n\t\t\tin the firelight. Then-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE STATION MASTER AT TSAVO STATION, WORKING IN HIS OFFICE. THE \nNEXT DAY.\n\n\t\t\t\tFEMALE VOICE (over)\n\t\tI'd like to see John Patterson,\n\t\tplease.\n\t\t\t(As he looks up-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nHELENA standing there in Tsavo; she looks weary from travel, but \nstill lovely. She holds their son in her arms. The kid is \nadorable.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELENA\n\t\tCould you tell him that his wife-\n\t\t\t(catches herself, smiles)\n\t\t-that his family has come to see him.\n\t\t\t(On that-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AT THE BRIDGE- Samuel hurries to him with the news- \nPatterson takes off running and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTSAVO STATION and Helena; she holds the sleeping child, walks back \nand forth along the shaded front of the building, no sound at all \nbut her heels.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, running like crazy and up ahead now is the station \narea.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHELENA- and now, in the distance, she sees him and she leaves the \nbuilding, walks out into the open, smiling and waving excitedly \nand\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, excitedly waving back and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, moving out of the grassy area behind Helena and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, suddenly screaming \"Get back- back-\"\n\nCUT TO\n\nHELENA, and she's too far away- his words are lost on the wind- \nshe smiles again, waves again and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, screaming now, all he has, \"GET BACK\" and\n\nCUT TO\n\nHELENA, and she still can't make out what he's saying but just the \nsame, she stops and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, stalking silently, closing on the mother and child.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHELENA, and the baby wakes, smiles and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, starting to run and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON and now it shows on his face- he's not going to get \nthere, he's never going to get there-\n\nCUT TO\n\nHELENA, and at last she knows something is terribly wrong and she \nturns-\n\n-but too late, too late as we\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, flying toward her now and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, in agony.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, leaping on them, taking them to the ground and as \nHelena cries out helplessly-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, crying out helplessly and\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nPATTERSON IN HIS TENT,\n\ncontinuing to cry out until he realized the nightmare he just had \nis over-\n\n-he staggers to his tent opening, goes outside.\n\nCUT TO\n\nOUTSIDE. It's dawn. Patterson, shaken, tries to rid himself of the \ndream. He looks around.\n\nRedbeard's tent is ripped- Patterson runs to it-\n\nCUT TO\n\nINSIDE THE TENT. It's empty. Patterson stares around-\n\n-there is blood on the tent floor and quickly-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SUN. RISING.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON running wildly, rifle in hand and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, carrying a weapon, hurrying to keep up and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, flying across rough terrain and as he and Samuel splash \nacross a small river, he gestures for them to split and they do, \nwidening the area of search and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, veering off and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHORN TREES, as Patterson rips through them, unmindful of the \ndamage to his clothes or his skin and\n\nCUT TO\n\nMORE THORNS- he plunges wildly ahead and\n\nCUT TO\n\nA LARGE ANTHILL- it seems to be casting an unusual shadow- \nPatterson slows, rifle ready, takes a breath, moves around it-\n\n-nothing at all- just his imagination which has been working \novertime and is only getting worse-\n\nPatterson stands there a moment, unsure where to go, what to do-\n\n-and then SAMUEL'S VOICE on the wind- calling to him-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, tracking the sound- Samuel's voice cries out again, \nlouder-\n\n-Patterson starts to run and run, and as he rounds a bend-\n\nCUT TO\n\nA FIELD OF WHITE GRASS. So lovely.\n\nWith one patch in the middle that is blood red.\n\nSomething is moving in the blood red area.\n\nPatterson has his rifle ready-\n\n-and then Samuel rises from the blood red patch.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL. In shock, in despair, call it what you want- he has seen \nsomething beyond imagination.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, rushing across the field of white grass, rushing to \nwhere Samuel stands in the patch of blood red grass- he looks down \ninto the grass-\n\n-clearly, Redbeard is there and clearly he is dead. Patterson and \nSamuel stare mute at one another-\n\n-and now, from frighteningly near them, comes the triumphant roar \nof The Darkness. They don't even react.\n\nCUT TO\n\nFLAMES RISING IN THE LATE AFTERNOON.\n\nWe should already have a sense of where we are; we've done this \nbefore.\n\nSTART PULLING BACK.\n\nSamuel stands there, trying to hold it together.\n\nKEEP PULLING BACK.\n\nPatterson stands there too, trying to hold it together.\n\nKEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL\n\nREDBEARD'S FUNERAL PYRE. Flames consume the body.\n\nJust Patterson and Samuel. No one else is there.\n\nThe flames lick at the sky...\n\nHOLD...\n\nCUT TO\n\nA LARGE BABOON. ONE LEG IS TIED TO THE END OF THE BRIDGE. GETTING \nDARK NOW.\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL, both armed, climbing the crane tower in use \nat the bridge, not far from the baboon.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tYou're positive lions hate baboons?\n\t\t\t(Samuel is)\n\t\tPebbles?\n\t\t\t(Samuel holds up a bag)\n\t\tLet's get it over with.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL as they reach the crane tower platform, \nfifteen feet from the baboon.\n\nThey help each other into position. Almost night.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE LARGE BABOON, baring its enormous teeth, shrieking out into \nthe darkness.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL on the platform. Samuel tosses a pebble \ntoward the baboon and the baboon cries out again, not in pain but \nirritation-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE PLATFORM. PATTERSON AND SAMUEL ARE FLOODED BY MOONLIGHT. IT'S \nTHE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.\n\nThey're both tired. Samuel throws another pebble. The baboon cries \nout.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, TENSE, ON THE PLATFORM. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.\n\nHe's tossing pebbles now as Samuel dozes. Paterson looks wild; \nonly nervous energy is keeping him going now.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SKY. The moon. Peaceful- then it turns bright yellow and \nfrightening black clouds gather and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, blinking, coming hard back to reality because the sky \nis not yellow nor were there black clouds- he's starting to \nhallucinate.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL ON THE PLATFORM.\n\nSamuel is awake now. Patterson stares at the river which is calm.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE RIVER, raging and black and lethal.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, hallucinating again.\n\nCUT TO\n\nJUST BEFORE DAWN\n\nand The Darkness suddenly is there, creeping across the bridge \ntoward the shrieking baboon and the instant it appears-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Firing-\n\nCUT TO\n\n-THE DARKNESS, and it's hit and it roars and goes down and-\n\nCUT TO\n\n-PATTERSON, turning, reaching for Samuel's rifle, grabbing it, \nturning back, ready to fire again-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS- gone.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL, blinking, looking around.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tWhere is it?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(pointing down)\n\t\tUnderneath.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tSomewhere.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHERE HE'S POINTING. The superstructure for the bridge- it goes \nseveral levels beneath the level where the railroad will run.\n\nThey look at each other- not good news and we find out why when we\n\nCUT TO\n\nEARLY MORNING LIGHT.\n\nPatterson and Samuel climb carefully down from their platform to \nthe railroad level. They reach the railroad level. PAtterson \nreleases the baboon which races away.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHERE THEY ARE. At the end of the bridge where they began \nconstruction. The bridge, two thirds finished, stretches away \nbefore them.\n\nCUT TO\n\nThey begin to walk the incomplete bridge... carefully...\n\n..as they go the look down through the crevices of their level, \nmaking sure they miss nothing.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL. Terrified. Holding his rifle extremely tightly.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Ready for anything.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE BRIDGE up ahead of them. There are some holes.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL slowing.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE HOLES. The nearest one is the largest.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. He goes on tiptoe, trying to see what's in the hole.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE HOLE. It seems empty.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL. One step forward. Another. They hold their \nbreaths.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE HOLE. It seems empty.\n\nCUT TO\n\nA SHOT FROM BELOW BRIDGE LEVEL- The Darkness is there.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, firing.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, going down through another level of scaffolding.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTRSON AND SAMUEL, trying to track it.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SCAFFOLDING. Nothing is visible.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL- Frozen. They listen-\n\n-nothing but their breathing.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, looking around everywhere.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE HOLE. Nothing.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE FIRST LEVEL of scaffolding. Nothing.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SECOND LEVEL of scaffolding. Nothing.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, looking this way, that way.\n\nSHOCK CUT TO\n\nTHE HOLE AS THE DARKNESS JUST FUCKING FLIES OUT OF IT- Patterson \nfalls back and fires and The Darkness is hit and goes down but it \ngets up and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, turning for Samuel's rifle-\n\n-only Samuel isn't there-\n\n-he's taken off for the trees at the end of the bridge and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS ROARING AND\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON and he turns, starts running too, running across the \nnarrow half-completed bridge and it's a bitch to do it without \nslipping or falling and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, wounded, sure, but the mother can still run and it \ntakes off after Patterson and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, making it to the end of the bridge and jumping for the \nnearest tree and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON running for his life across the bridge and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, closing the gap and ordinarily Patterson would be a \ndead man but even though The Darkness hasn't got its ordinary \nspeed, it's still faster than Patterson and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, and he's never gone this fast in his life and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TREE HE'S HEADED FOR, a different one from Samuel's and it's \njust up ahead and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, closing and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TREE, and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, springing into the air now and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, diving for the lowest branch, grabbing hold with both \nhands, swinging his body up as we\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, barely missing as Patterson gets his body onto the \nbranch and now comes this insane roar and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL with his rifle, as he climbs higher into his tree.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON in the next tree, climbing higher, until he's fifteen \nfeet up.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, on the ground, circling the trunk of Patterson's \ntree, raging with frustration.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, exhausted but it's okay now, he's safe, and as he looks \nacross at the next tree not far away where Samuel is-\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(embarrassed)\n\t\tAfraid of lions.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tIt's all right, Samuel- we all\n\t\tget hit-\n\t\t\t(Now he shuts up \n\t\t\tfast and-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, as it does this incredible thing- it starts to climb \nthe tree after Patterson. Lions are cats and when they want to \nclimb, up they go and that's what The Darkness is doing now, going \nup and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, and it's terrifying- he reaches for the branch above, \nclimbing higher and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, climbing higher too and the tree is sturdy but there \nis a four hundred pound thing rocking it now and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, going still higher but the branches are getting thinner \nand the tree is shaking, and he could fall-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, climbing on, nothing can stop it-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND THE DARKNESS, together in the tree, and there's no \nfurther Patterson can go and it's harder for The Darkness too, but \nslowly it moves in and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, calling out-\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tSamuel!\n\t\t\t(And he gestures for\n\t\t\tthe rifle and the\n\t\t\tinstant he does-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, and he takes the rifle between his two hands and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, steadily moving in and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, tossing the rifle with great care and Patterson's less \nthan fifteen feet away and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, hands out to catch it and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE RIFLE in mid-air and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, both hands ready and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE RIFLE as it strikes a tree branch, spins away to the ground.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, almost on Patterson now and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, suddenly leaping out of the tree, and yes it's a long \nway and sure it's going to damage him but sometimes there aren't a \nlot of choices in this world and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, staring as Patterson falls and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, crashing hard to earth, stunned, hurt, ribs broken, leg \nbroken and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, and it's so big it's hard for it to get room to turn \nbut it does and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON crawling for the rifle, and he's in terrible pain but he \nreaches the weapon, grabs for it and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, skittering down the tree and as it reaches the \nground\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, forcing himself to his feet and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, a dozen feet away as with a roar it starts its \ncharge.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, aims, fires and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, hit again and down it goes again but up it comes \nagain and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, firing the final shot and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, hit again and it has to stop, it just has to-\n\n-but it doesn't.\n\nIt roars and roars and moves slowly toward Patterson.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON; all bullets gone, no place to hide.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS. Still moving forward.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. He takes a step backward, falls backwards over a \nbranch, lands hard and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, framed between Patterson's legs. Six feet away, now \nfour, now-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, helpless on the ground.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, and the eyes glow-\n\n-a branch is on the ground in front of it- it buries its huge \nteeth into the branch-\n\n-now a long dying sigh... and it goes to the ground.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Can't breathe.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, dead, its teeth still buried in the tree branch.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. CLOSE UP. And suddenly he just empties and tears pour \ndown his face and he begins to cry out loud, his body wracked with \nsobs. He manages to get to his knees, moves next to the animal-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND THE DARKNESS. Just the sound of Patterson's tears...\n\nHOLD.\n\nKEEP HOLDING.\n\nCAMERA BEGINS TO RISE-\n\n-WE ARE LOOKING AT THE BRIDGE NOW- AND IT'S FINISHED!\n\n-hundreds of people are watching as the first train goes oer it-\n\n-Samuel is there- lighting up the world with his smile-\n\n-and Patterson's there, too.

They put her \n               down in the sand along with FIVE JEWEL ENCRUSTED JARS.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         Her body was mummified, her vital \n                         organs removed and placed in sacred \n                         canopic jars.\n\n               Imhotep, filled with dread, reads from a OBOOKO made out of \n               pure GOLD. THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE LIVING.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         The Book of The Living contained \n                         sacred incantations that would send \n                         the evil dead on a journey into the \n                         dark underworld.\n\n               Strange LIGHT suddenly FLASHES across the faces of the slaves \n               and the EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS. Suddenly, everyone's fear-filled \n               eyes all rise, as if watching Anck-su-namun's body rising.\n\n               Then one last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, \n               and it's over. Anck-su-namun's body now lies twisted on the \n               ground.\n\n               Imhotep's Priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus.\n\n               The Nubian slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand. \n               Imhotep then signals to the Soldiers, who throw their spears \n               at the Nubians. Killing them.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         The slaves were killed...\n\n               Imhotep's knife-wielding Priests attack the now unarmed \n               Soldiers, hacking at them in the flickering darkness as \n               Imhotep and the Mumia solemnly watches.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         ...and the soldiers who killed them \n                         were also slain, so that no unholy \n                         person should ever know the exact \n                         location of the burial site.\n\n               The Mumia walk off across the sand and then, one by one, the \n               Priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the \n               vanishing Mumia. As the last Mumia disappears over a distant \n               dune, Imhotep nods, and the Priests leap onto Anck-su-namun's \n               grave and begin digging it back up with their hands.\n\n               EXT. SAHARA DESERT - NIGHT\n\n               CHARIOTS race out into the moonlit desert. Imhotep leads the \n               way. A \"hearse\" carries Anck-su-namun's mummy. THE MAP OF \n               ANCIENT EGYPT FADES UP. The chariots race across the map.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         But there was another book, The Book \n                         Of The Dead, which was never to be \n                         opened, never to be read, for it \n                         contained the incantations that could \n                         bring a dead body back to life a \n                         most unholy thing.\n\n               The chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic. \n               They race up the stone ramp and in through the city gates.\n\n               SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS:\n\n                              HAMUNAPTRA - City of the Dead\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         It was hidden at Hamunaptra, City of \n                         the Dead, inside the statue of Anubis, \n                         so that no such sacrilege might ever \n                         disgrace Egypt.\n\n               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - ANUBIS SITE - NIGHT\n\n               Imhotep pulls an ORNATE CHEST out of a SECRET COMPARTMENT \n               inside the giant STATUE OF ANUBIS. He opens the chest and \n               lifts out THE BOOK OF THE DEAD, made of black stone.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         But for my love of Anck-su-namun I \n                         was willing to defy the gods.\n\n               INT. UNDERGROUND NECROPOLIS - NIGHT\n\n               Big hairy RATS scurry through the mausoleums and over the \n               headstones of this very large, scary, UNDERGROUND CEMETERY.\n\n               A DETRITUS MOAT surrounds the cemetery, -- muck made out of \n               filthy water and human remains. Skulls bob in the goop. The \n               Priests have gathered in a circle. Their hooded, lifeless \n               eyes seem dead to this world. Their bald heads rock back and \n               forth as they CHANT, a quiet eerie HUM. Heinous creatures.\n\n               In the middle of the circle is a strange, twisted ALTAR.\n\n               Imhotep has unwrapped Anck-su-namun's gorgeous, lifeless \n               body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         Anck-su-namun's vital organs were \n                         still fresh, so a human sacrifice \n                         would not need be made.\n\n               As Imhotep begins to read from The Book of The Dead, a large \n               SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog. Several \n               Priests look over at it, frightened, then quickly look back \n               down and resume CHANTING. A strange MIST wafts up out of the \n               swirling hole and over to the jars, it passes through them \n               and into Anck-su-namun's body. One of the jars SHUDDERS, the \n               heart inside begins to BEAT. The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING \n               HOLE, WAFTING MIST, BEATING HEART and IMHOTEP'S READINGS are \n               reaching a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's EYES suddenly FLY OPEN.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         Anck-su-namun soul had come back \n                         from the dead! Now all that was \n                         needed, was to return her organs to \n                         their rightful place within her body.\n\n               Imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above Anck-su-namun's \n               breast, about to plunge it down. The CHANTING, SWIRLING and \n               BEATING heart CLIMAX. And that's when the Mumia BURST IN and \n               storm through the startled Priests. The HEAD MUMIA SMASHES \n               the jar with the beating heart. The MIST instantly sucks \n               back out of Anck-su-namun's body and IMPLODES back into the \n               swirling hole.\n\n               Anck-su-namun's eyes close. Dying once again. Imhotep SCREAMS \n               in rage. The Mumia grab him and his Priests.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         My Priests were condemned to be \n                         mummified alive.\n\n               INT. EMBALMING CHAMBER (NECROPOLIS RE-VAMP) - NIGHT\n\n               Inside a TORCH-LIT CHAMBER, Imhotep is held by Anubis-headed \n               EMBALMERS. He cringes at the flickering, impressionistic \n               glimpses of his Priests being embalmed and mummified alive.\n\n               The horrid-looking Embalmers, using knives, needles and \n               thread, calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the SCREAMING \n               Priests, who are going insane from the procedure.\n\n               A red hot POKER is pulled out of a pit of burning coals.\n\n               A Priest's head is wedged between two strong boards. His \n               eyes widen in terror as an Embalmer moves to insert the red \n               hot poker up his nose.\n\n               But just before he does, WE QUICKLY CUT TO IMHOTEP'S FACE, \n               horrified, as OFF CAMERA, the Priest SCREAMS.\n\n               WE GO WIDE on the chamber. All twenty-one of Imhotep's Priests \n               squirm inside their wrappings. Imhotep is forced to his knees.\n\n               His arms are held back. His mouth is pried open.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         As for me, I was condemned to endure \n                         the HOM-DAI. The worst of all ancient \n                         curses. One so horrible, it had never \n                         before been bestowed.\n\n               Using a pair of tongs, an Embalmer slowly pulls Imhotep's \n               TONGUE out of his mouth, then places a very sharp knife on \n               top of it. WE GO TIGHT on IMHOTEP'S EYES as his tongue is \n               apparently cut out. The Embalmer flings Imhotep's tongue \n               onto the floor. The Mumia's dogs attack and quickly eat it.\n\n               Imhotep is WRAPPED ALIVE. Only his mouth, nostrils and \n               fearfilled eyes are left free of the slimy bandages. Detritus \n               muck boils inside a black cauldron. Embalmers scoop out the \n               fetid muck and apply it to Imhotep's wrappings as he squirms.\n\n               He's then laid in a wooden COFFIN inside a stone SARCOPHAGUS.\n\n               An Embalmer with a BUCKET steps up and looks into the coffin.\n\n               Imhotep's wild eyes stare back. The Embalmer empties the \n               bucket over Imhotep's chest: dozens of SCARABS, disgusting \n               dung beetles. They scurry across Imhotep's SCREAMING face.\n\n               Some vanish into his tongue-less mouth and up his nostrils.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         By eating the sacred scarabs, I would \n                         be cursed to stay alive forever. And \n                         by eating me, they were cursed just \n                         the same.\n\n               The lid to the coffin is SLAMMED SHUT. Then, using a strange \n               four-sided KEY, the Head Mumia locks the coffin lid tight.\n\n               The heavy sarcophagus lid is shoved into place and with a \n               loud WHOOSH seals itself airtight. Once again, the Head Mumia \n               uses the strange key, locking the sarcophagus lid tight.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         I was to remain sealed inside my \n                         sarcophagus, the undead for all of \n                         eternity.\n\n               The blue-skinned, strangely tattooed man carefully collapses \n               the sides of the key, -- turning it into a little puzzle \n               BOX.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         They would never allow me to be \n                         released. For I would arise a walking \n                         disease, a plague upon mankind, an \n                         unholy flesh-eater, with the strength \n                         of ages, power over the sands, and \n                         the glory of invincibility.\n\n               Imhotep's sarcophagus is dropped into a DETRITUS PIT. The \n               disgusting muck SPLASHES up, drools down it-s sides, and \n               then is mysteriously sucked into It's seams, vanishing clean.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         And if I could raise my beloved Anck-\n                         su-namun from her place in hell, \n                         together, we would be an unstoppable \n                         infection upon this world. The \n                         Apocalypse. The End.\n\n               Imhotep's horrifying tongue-less SCREAMS can be heard coming \n               from inside his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt \n               onto it.

It stares at us. Then begins \n               to DECAY before our very eyes, aging 4,159 years in only \n               seconds. And then we find ourselves and the decrepit, half-\n               buried statue of Anubis out in the middle of the desert.\n\n               EXT. SAHARA - HAMANAPTRA RUINS (1925) - DAY\n\n               Imhotep's horrifying SCREAMS become the SCREAMS of a TUAREG \n               HORSEMAN.\n\n               Racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior \n               brethren.

O'Connell and Beni run through the ruins.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         How'd a guy like you end up in the \n                         Legion anyways?\n\n                                     BENI\n                         I got caught robbing a synagogue. \n                         Lots of good stuff in them holy \n                         places; churches, temples, mosques, \n                         and who's guarding them?\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Altar boys?\n\n                                     BENI\n                         Exactly! I speak seven languages, \n                         including Hebrew, so my specialty \n                         was synagogues. How about you? Kill \n                         somebody?\n\n               Beni trips and accidentally tackles O'Connell to the ground.\n\n               O'Connell gives him a nasty look.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         No, but I'm considering it.\n\n               They get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp\n\n                                     BENI\n                         What then? Robbery? Extortion? \n                         Kidnapping!\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         None of the above, thank you.\n\n                                     BENI\n                         Then what the hell are you doing \n                         here!?\n\n               They both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the \n               horde of warriors. The SOUND of CHARGING HORSES is deafening.\n\n               O'Connell gives Beni a big cheesy smile.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         I was just looking for a good time.\n\n               And that's when the cowardly Legionnaire Colonel suddenly \n               panics, cuts and runs. O'Connell instantly stiffens.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Oh shit. Steady!\n\n               Gives the men around him courage. But onward comes the horde \n               Hoofs pounding the sand. Several more Legionnaires take off.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         STEADY!\n                              (to himself)\n                         What the hell am I sayin'?\n\n               The Tuaregs let loose with those horrifying oooo-loo-loog \n               SCREAMS. More Legionnaires haul-ass. Beni is one of them.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         STEADY!!\n                              (to himself)\n                         What the hell am I doin'?\n\n               The Tuaregs set their rifles and take aim. O'Connell steels \n               himself, cocks and locks. The cartridge in his mouth suddenly \n               snaps, he spits it into the sand. Another BEAT. And then --\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         FIRE!\n\n               The Legionnaires on the ground FIRE. The rifles report with \n               a CRASH. The BLAST blows dozens of Tuaregs clean off their \n               mounts. The prone Legionnaires quickly begin to reload.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         FIRE!\n\n               The kneeling Legionnaires FIRE. More Tuaregs bite the sand.\n\n               The remaining warriors OPEN FIRE. THUNDER and SMOKE rip the \n               hot air. A third of the Legionnaires are killed instantly.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         FIRE!\n\n               The remaining standing Legionnaires FIRE. Tuaregs spin off \n               their mounts. Crash to the sand. And then the entire Tuareg \n               force plows into the ruins and through the Legionnaires.\n\n               O'Connell grabs the barrel of his rifle and starts CLUBBING \n               riders off their steeds, fighting like a man possessed.\n\n               Beni on the other hand, is bellycrawling across the sand, \n               whimpering in full retreat as Legionnaires fall dead all \n               around him. He crawls through the front gate.\n\n               O'Connell throws his rifle down and goes for his guns. He \n               cross-draws, gun in each hand, starts blowing riders off \n               their mounts.\n\n               Beni crawls faster, and then he spots an open TEMPLE DOORWAY \n               amongst the rocks. He gets up and sprints for the door as \n               the last of the Legionnaires are shot off their feet behind \n               him. O'Connell's guns go empty.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Son-of-a-bitch.\n\n               He turns and runs like hell, right through the front gate.\n\n               Four Tuareg warriors on massive Arabians haul-ass after him.\n\n               O'Connell hurdles a stone column, hits the ground running.\n\n               He spots Beni inside the Temple doorway, trying to close the \n               heavy sandstone door.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Hey! Beni! Wait up!\n\n               Beni has no intention of waiting up, he pushes harder.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         What are ya doing?! Wait up!\n\n               O'Connell runs faster. Beni pushes harder. The four Horsemen \n               LEAP the big column and CHARGE after him. HOOFS POUNDING.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Don't you close that door! DON'T YOU \n                         CLOSE THAT DOOR!\n\n               Beni closes the door just as O'Connell reaches it. O'Connell \n               SLAMS his body into the door. It doesn't budge.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         I'm gonna get you for this!\n\n               He turns and bolts off around the rocks. Running for his \n               life, weaving through the ruins. The Arabians getting closer \n               and closer. The POUNDING hoofs getting LOUDER and LOUDER.\n\n               O'Connell finally spins around and faces his attackers. The \n               four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him. The \n               vicious Tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off.\n\n               O'Connell just stands there, exhausted and beaten, then he \n               slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird.\n\n               And that's when the horses go ape-shit. All four of them \n               REAR UP. Two of the Riders are THROWN to the ground. The \n               horses SCREECH and BELLOW and SNORT in fear, then buck like \n               fury and haul-ass away as if the devil himself had scared \n               them. The thrown Riders get up and race off after their \n               mounts.\n\n               O'Connell just stands there, stunned, then he lifts his right \n               hand and checks out his middle finger. And then he feels the \n               evil himself, and turns around. -- The shattered, decrepit \n               statue of Anubis stares back at him.\n\n               Suddenly, the sand begins to shift under O'Connell's feet.\n\n               He starts to back away, keeping his eyes on the transforming \n               sand, it looks like huge snakes are wiggling and writhing \n               beneath it, forming lines and shapes, -- drawing a picture.\n\n               O'Connell quickly turns and runs off through the ruins. The \n               sand stops moving, and we can now see that, drawn in the \n               sand, is a picture of IMHOTEP'S SCREAMING FACE.\n\n               EXT. RIDGE - DAY\n\n               Up on a ridge, A GROUP OF RIDERS watch O'Connell stumble \n               clear of the decrepit city. O'Connell feels their presence \n               and looks up. Very different from the Tuaregs, they have \n               BLUE TINTED SKIN and faces covered in strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS.\n\n               The Mumia. Still watching Imhotep's grave after all this \n               time.\n\n               The MUMIA LEADER is a huge, fierce Man in black robes, with \n               dual scimitars across his waist. His face is both handsome \n               and horrible, blue and tattooed. Meet ARDETH RAY. His dark \n               eyes watch O'Connell stagger off into the open desert...\n\n               EXT. CAIRO - DAY\n\n               Cairo, a city so old the stars have actually changed their \n               positions in the sky since it's birth. A city teeming with \n               every form of life. A strange, mysterious, wonderful city.\n\n               WE SUPERIMPOSE it's name across the SCREEN:\n\n                                          CAIRO\n\n               INT. CAIRO MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY\n\n               Deep in the bowels of the museum lie the STACKS. Rows upon \n               rows of towering bookshelves. Filled with literature on the \n               Antiquities. Standing at the top of a tall ladder between \n               two of these rows and leaning against one of the bookshelves, \n               is a rather uninteresting British GIRL: eye-glasses, hair-in- \n               a-bun, long boring dress, your typical prudish nightmare.\n\n               This is EVELYN CARNARVON. We're going to fall in love with \n               her.\n\n               Evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm, blows \n               the dust off it, then places it on a shelf with other books \n               whose titles all begin with the letter \"O\". Then she grabs \n               another book out from under her arm and reads the title.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Tuthmosis?... Now how did you get up \n                         here?\n\n               Carefully, so as not to lose her balance, she looks over her \n               shoulder to the bookshelf behind her, where all the titles \n               begin with the letter \"T\". Then she looks down. It's a long \n               way to the bottom. Evelyn gently sets the other books down \n               on the top shelf, then turns and gingerly starts to reach \n               across the aisle with the Tuthmosis book. It's a little too \n               far, so she stretches, reaching, holding the top of the ladder \n               with her fingertips, she's almost got it, closer now closer.\n\n               And that's when the ladder pulls away from the shelf. Evelyn \n               YELPS, flings the Tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the \n               ladder, which stands straight up. Evelyn holds her breath, \n               swaying precariously, a long BEAT, and then she loses her \n               balance, the ladder swings around and Evelyn starts \n               stiltwalking down the aisle.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         OHEIUGM!! AHHHHHH!\n\n               The ladder crosses the aisle, does an about face and heads \n               back the way it came. Evelyn clings to the top, struggling \n               for balance. The ladder teeters out into the main aisle and \n               picks up speed. Evelyn SCREAMS as it does a 180, spins into \n               another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a \n               bookshelf. Evelyn holds her breath, then SIGHS HEAVILY.\n\n               And that's when the bookshelf falls away from her and CRASHES \n               into the next bookshelf.\n\n               Evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor. She \n               looks up just as the domino effect kicks-in: each bookshelf \n               crashing into the next. And onward it goes. Bookshelf after \n               bookshelf. Thousands of volumes flinging off shelves and \n               scattering across the floor. It finally ends as the last \n               shelf CRASHES into a wall. Evelyn's eyes are closed. She \n               opens one eye. Looks left. Then right. Then opens the other \n               eye and stares at the huge mess.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Oops.\n\n               The Egyptian CURATOR storms in.\n\n                                     CURATOR\n                         Look at this! Sons of the Messiah! \n                         Give me frogs, flies, locusts, \n                         anything but this! Compared to you, \n                         the other plagues were a joy!\n\n               Evelyn quickly gets up and starts gathering books.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         I'm sorry, it was an accident.\n\n                                     CURATOR\n                         When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it \n                         was an accident. You are a \n                         catastrophe! Why do I put up with \n                         you?\n\n               Evelyn turns to him, trying to contain herself.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         You put up with me, because I can \n                         read and write ancient Egyptian, \n                         decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, \n                         and I'm the only person within a \n                         thousand miles who knows how to \n                         properly code and catalogue this \n                         library.\n\n                                     CURATOR\n                         Who needs smart women? I put up with \n                         you because your mother and father \n                         were our finest patrons, Allah rest \n                         their souls. Now straighten up this \n                         mess!\n\n               The Curator storms out. Evelyn just stands there, steaming.\n\n               And then she hears a NOISE and quickly turns around. A BEAT.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Hello?\n\n               Quiet. Eerie. And then she hears it again, like feet, slowly \n               shuffling across the floor, coming from a nearby gallery.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Abdul? Mohammed? Bob?\n\n               Evelyn walks through the stacks and enters --\n\n               INT. THE RAMESSEUM\n\n               Filled with treasures and plunder from the Middle Kingdom. \n               It's very dark and quiet in here, the only LIGHT is from \n               FLICKERING TORCHES at either end of the spooky gallery.\n\n               The NOISE again! From the far side of the room. Feet, slowly \n               shuffling, plodding across the floor. Evelyn grabs a torch.\n\n               Looks around, at a statue of Anubis, another of Horus, they \n               stare down at Evelyn, who is starting to get scared now. She \n               walks down the aisle. Past a closed sarcophagus. Past cases \n               of ancient artifacts. Past another sarcophagus, -- only this \n               one is OPEN! Evelyn freezes, swallows hard, nervously looks \n               around to see who could have opened it. Then she slowly leans \n               forward with the torch, and peers inside.\n\n               -- A hideous rotted MUMMY sits up and SCREECHES at her!\n\n               Evelyn SCREAMS, drops the torch and backs away, scared out \n               of her wits. And then, coming from inside the sarcophagus, \n               she hears a Man LAUGHING. Her eyes narrow as a foppish cad \n               crawls out from behind the Mummy, laughing his ass off, half \n               drunk.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         You...! YOU...!\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please \n                         call me something original.\n\n               Meet JONATHAN CARNARVON. As he crawls out of the sarcophagus, \n               Evelyn pulls a cigarette out of the mummy's mouth.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Have you no respect for the dead?\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Right now, I only wish to join them.\n\n               He grins drunkenly. Evelyn punches him hard in the chest.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather \n                         than later, before you ruin my career \n                         the way you've ruined yours.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll \n                         have you know, that at this moment \n                         my career is on a high note.\n\n               He BELCHES, then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         High note? Ha! For five years you've \n                         been scrounging around Egypt, and \n                         what have you to show for it? Nothing.\n\n               Jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his jacket.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Oh yes I do! I have something right \n                         here!\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Oh no, not another worthless trinket, \n                         Jonathan, if I bring one more piece \n                         of junk to the Curator to try and \n                         sell for you.\n\n               Jonathan pulls out a small, ancient BOX; the collapsed KEY \n               to Imhotep's sarcophagus and coffin. Evelyn is instantly \n               curious, she grabs the box out of his hand.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Where did you get this?\n\n               Jonathan knows her weaknesses, gives her a mischievous smile.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         On a dig, down in Thebes.\n\n               Evelyn rolls the box around in her hands, mumbling to herself \n               as she translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs covering it.\n\n               Jonathan licks his lips in anticipation.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         My whole life I've never found \n                         anything, Evy. Tell me I've found \n                         something.\n\n               Evelyn's fingers play with the various little slats on the \n               box, shifting them this way and that way, it's like a puzzle \n               box. Then suddenly, it UNFOLDS ITSELF, almost-mechanically, \n               turning itself into the KEY. Sitting inside the open key/box \n               is a folded piece of GOLDEN PAPYRUS. An ANCIENT MAP.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Jonathan?\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Yes?\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         I think you found something.\n\n               INT. CURATOR'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               The Curator sits at his desk, staring through a jeweler's \n               eyepiece at the key/box. Evelyn hovers behind him, excited.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         See the cartouche there, it's the \n                         official royal seal of Seti the First, \n                         I'm sure of it.\n\n                                     CURATOR\n                         Perhaps.\n\n               Jonathan leans in from across the desk.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Two questions. Who the hell is Seti \n                         the First? And was he rich?\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         He was the last Pharaoh of the Old \n                         Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest \n                         Pharaoh of them all.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Alright, good, that's good. I like \n                         this fellow, like him very much.\n\n               The Curator picks up the MAP. It's actually the exact same \n               map that we established in the opening scenes of the movie.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         I've already dated it, this map is \n                         almost four thousand years old. And \n                         the hieratics over here...\n                              (Inhales deeply)\n                         It's Hamunaptra.\n\n               The Curator freezes, suddenly very nervous, then he recovers.\n\n                                     CURATOR\n                         My dear girl, don't be ridiculous, \n                         we are scholars, not treasure hunters. \n                         Hamunaptra is a myth.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Are we talking about the Hamunaptra?\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the \n                         early Pharaohs were said to have \n                         hidden the wealth of Egypt.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Right, right, in a big underground \n                         treasure chamber. Everybody knows \n                         the story. The entire necropolis was \n                         rigged to sink into the sand. On \n                         Pharaoh's command, a flick of the \n                         switch! And the whole place could \n                         disappear beneath the dunes.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         All we know is that the city \n                         mysteriously vanished around 2,134 \n                         B.C.\n\n               The Curator holds the map closer to the burning CANDLE-LAMP.\n\n                                     CURATOR\n                         As the Americans would say: it's all \n                         fairy tales and hokum.\n\n               The map 'accidentally,' CATCHES ON FIRE. The Curator throws \n               it to the floor. Jonathan drops to his knees and quickly \n               puts it out. Lifts it up. The left third of the map is now \n               missing.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         You burned it! You burned off the \n                         part with the lost city!\n\n                                     CURATOR\n                         It's for the best, I'm sure. Many \n                         men have wasted their lives in the \n                         foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra, no \n                         one has ever found it, most have \n                         never returned.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                              (devastated)\n                         You killed my map.\n\n                                     CURATOR\n                         I'm sure it was a fake, anyway, I'm \n                         surprised at you, Miss Carnarvon, to \n                         be so fooled.\n\n               The Curator reaches for the key/box. Evelyn quickly snatches \n               it off the desk and gives him a very angry, suspicious look.\n\n               EXT. CAIRO PRISON - GALLOWS COURTYARD - DAY\n\n               Cairo prison. One of the worst hell holes on earth. Every \n               low-life form of scumbag can be found here. The WARDEN, a \n               first rate scumbag himself, escorts Evelyn and Jonathan across \n               the gallows courtyard.

VISITOR'S PEN - DAY\n\n               The Warden ushers Evelyn and Jonathan into the holding pen.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         And what is he in prison for?\n\n                                     WARDEN\n                         I did not know, so when I heard you \n                         were coming, I asked him that myself.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         And what did he say?\n\n                                     WARDEN\n                         He said... he was just looking for a \n                         good time.\n\n               The interior cell door BURSTS OPEN. O'Connell is in chains, \n               dragged by FOUR GUARDS, they shove him up to the cell bars.\n\n               From the looks of it, he's been here awhile; his face is \n               half hidden by long hair, a scraggly beard and many new \n               bruises. Evelyn looks at him, disgusted by his appearance.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         But he's just a filthy criminal?\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                              (cringing)\n                         Way to go, Evy.\n\n               O'Connell gives Evelyn the once over, then looks at Jonathan.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         So who's the broad?\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Broad?!\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         She's my sister, actually.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a \n                         total loss.\n\n               Evelyn is stunned and furious. The Warden heads out the door.\n\n                                     WARDEN\n                         I'll be back in a moment.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                              (sarcastic)\n                         I tremble with anticipation.\n\n               A Guard CLUBS O'Connell across the head, O'Connell's face \n               bounces off the metal bars. He shows no pain, but just looks \n               back and gives the Guard a nasty look. Evelyn steps closer.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         We uh,... found... your puzzle box, \n                         and we've come to ask you about it.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         No.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         No?\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         No... You came to ask me about \n                         Hamunaptra.\n\n               Evelyn and Jonathan quickly look around, hoping the guards \n               didn't hear him. They step closer.

A Guard CLUBS him, his face bounces off \n               the bars again, but before he can react the Guards GRAB him, \n               YANKS him away from the bars and DRAG him out of the room.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Where are they taking him?\n\n                                     WARDEN\n                         To be hanged.\n\n               Evelyn is shocked.

Evelyn follows the warden \n               onto a balcony above the gallows.

Evelyn is suitably impressed.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Oh... um,... hello.\n\n               Jonathan grabs O'Connell's arm and shakes his hand.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Smashing day for the start of an \n                         adventure, eh, O'Connell?\n\n               O'Connell quickly checks his pockets.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Yeah, sure, smashing.\n\n               He finds his wallet and relaxes. DIRECTLY ABOVE HIM: on the \n               bow of the barge, Burns wipes his bifocals and turns to Beni.\n\n                                     BURNS\n                         You're sure Hamunaptra is out there?\n\n                                     BENI\n                         Along with the scorched bones of my \n                         entire garrison, sahib.\n\n               And that's when Beni spots O'Connell. Beni shakes his head, \n               as if seeing a mirage, then starts backing away from the \n               men.\n\n                                     BENI\n                         A thousand pardons, my good sahibs \n                         but there is much work to be done.\n\n               Beni quickly scurries off, vanishing down into the hold.\n\n               BACK DOWN WITH: Evelyn, recovering, she clears her throat.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Mister O'Connell, can you look me in \n                         the eye, and guarantee me this is \n                         not some sort of flimflam? Because \n                         if it is, I'm warning you --\n\n               O'Connell steps up close to Evelyn, invading her space looks \n               her straight in the eye. Evelyn doesn't back away.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         All I can tell you, miss, is that my \n                         Colonel found that map in an ancient \n                         fortress, and the whole damn garrison \n                         believed in it so much, that without \n                         orders, we marched halfway across \n                         Libya and into Egypt to find that \n                         city. Like I told ya, all I saw was \n                         sand. Everybody else was wiped out \n                         by Tuareg warriors. I'll take your \n                         bags.\n\n               O'Connell takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto \n               the same passenger barge that Beni and the Americans are on.\n\n               Evelyn's eyes follow him, a bit wistfully. Jonathan sees it.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Yes, yes, you're right, filthy, rude, \n                         a complete scoundrel, nothing to \n                         like there at all.\n\n               Evelyn gives him a look. Jonathan just grins. And that's \n               when the warden suddenly brushes past, tipping his raggedy \n               hat.\n\n                                     WARDEN\n                         A bright good morning to all.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         What are you doing here?\n\n                                     WARDEN\n                         I have come to protect my investment, \n                         thank you very much.\n\n               And up the plank he goes. Evelyn and Jonathan share a look.\n\n               WE GO WIDE AGAIN: as the barge pulls out and heads down the \n               Nile. WE TILT UP: to the SUN, which then DISSOLVES into --\n\n               EXT. RIVER NILE - NIGHT\n\n               The MOON, shining down on the desert. The THREE VICIOUS MUMIA \n               quietly glide a narrow skiff out onto the river. The one \n               with the hook sits in the middle of the skiff, the other two \n               row, heading for the PASSENGER BARGE coming their way.\n\n               EXT. THE BAR AT THE BOW - NIGHT\n\n               Jonathan and the three Americans are playing poker. O'Connell \n               comes out a door carrying a GUNNY-SACK.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we \n                         could use another good player.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         I only gamble with my life, never my \n                         money.\n\n                                     DANIELS\n                         Never? What if I were to wager five \n                         hundred dollars says we get to \n                         Hamunaptra before you?\n\n               O'Connell returns Daniel's cocky look.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Yer on.\n\n               Burns slips on his dirty bifocals.\n\n                                     BURNS\n                         What makes you so confident, sir?\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         What makes you?\n\n               Henderson spits a wad of chew into a spittoon.\n\n                                     HENDERSON\n                         We got us a man who's actually been \n                         there.\n\n               O'Connell's poker face drops, perplexed. Same with Jonathan.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         I say, what a coincidence, why --\n\n               O'Connell 'accidentally' hits him in the ribs with the \n               gunnysack, shutting him up. Jonathan quickly covers.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         -- whose deal is it? Is it my deal? \n                         I thought I just dealt?\n\n               EXT. BARGE - NIGHT\n\n               Evelyn sits on a table, staring out over the passing river.\n\n               The gunny-sack DROPS onto the table, startling her.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         The only thing that scares me, Mister \n                         O'Connell, are your manners.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         If you call that a kiss.\n\n               O'Connell reaches into the gunny-sack and starts pulling out \n               revolvers, pistols, hunting knives, a massive elephant gun, \n               and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Did I miss something? Are we going \n                         into battle?\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         The last time I was at that place \n                         everybody I was with died.\n\n               This takes the smile off Evelyn's face. O'Connell starts \n               dismantling and cleaning the guns.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         There's something out there, you \n                         know, something under that sand.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain \n                         artifact, a book, actually, my brother \n                         thinks there's treasure. What do you \n                         think is out there?\n\n               O'Connell looks into Evelyn's eyes.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin \n                         believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, \n                         they call it, \"the doorway to hell.\"\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Ahmar is Ossirion. \"Passageway to \n                         the underworld\", actually.\n\n               She gives him a know-it-all grin.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         I don't believe in fairy tales and \n                         hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do \n                         believe that one of the most famous \n                         books in history is buried out there, \n                         The Book Of The Living. It's what \n                         first interested me in Egypt as a \n                         child. It's why I came here, sort of \n                         a life's pursuit.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         And the fact that they say it's made \n                         out of pure gold, makes no nevermind \n                         to you, right?\n\n               Evelyn is surprised by his knowledge.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         You know your history.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         I know my treasure.\n\n               Evelyn gets up to go, then she hesitates, nervous, she turns \n               back to O'Connell, and as matter-of-fact as possible says:\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         By the way,... why did you kiss me?\n\n               O'Connell, cleaning his guns, just shrugs his shoulders.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         I was about to be hanged, seemed \n                         like a good idea at the time.\n\n               Evelyn's eyes widen, furious, she turns and storms off.\n\n               O'Connell looks up, watching her leave, a bit perplexed.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         What?... Wha'd I say?\n\n               Then he hears someone SNICKERING under the table. He quickly \n               reaches down, grabs that someone and lifts him up. It's Beni.\n\n                                     BENI\n                         My very good friend! What a surprise.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Why if it ain't my little buddy, \n                         Beni. I oughta kill you.\n\n               O'Connell sticks a knife under Beni's throat. Beni swallows \n               hard, then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin.\n\n                                     BENI\n                         You never were any good with the \n                         ladies, O'Connell.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         So you're the one leading the \n                         Americans, I shoulda figured. So \n                         what's the scam? You get 'em out in \n                         the middle of the desert then leave \n                         'em to rot?\n\n                                     BENI\n                         Unfortunately no, these Americans \n                         are smart, they pay me only half \n                         now, half when I get them back to \n                         Cairo, so I must go all the way.\n\n               O'Connell pulls the knife away. Beni relaxes, rubs his neck.\n\n                                     BENI\n                         You never believed in Hamunaptra, \n                         O'Connell. Why are you going back? \n                         The devil himself lives out there.\n\n               They look as they hear Evelyn YELP. A single CAMEL in the \n               HORSE PADDOCK takes another bite at her. She YELPS again and \n               backs away. O'Connell grins as Evelyn flees down the deck.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         The girl saved my life, figured it \n                         was the least I could do, keep her \n                         out of trouble.\n\n                                     BENI\n                         You always did have more balls than \n                         brains.\n\n               O'Connell's eyes narrow at the insult, he looks back at Beni.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Let's make us even, shall we?\n\n                                     BENI\n                         Even?\n\n               O'Connell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the barge.\n\n               Beni SPLASHES into the river. O'Connell takes his gunny-sack \n               and starts walking off down the deck.\n\n                                     BENI (O.S.)\n                         O'Connell! I am going to kill you \n                         for this!\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Sounds familiar.\n\n               And that's when he spots THREE SETS OF WET FOOTPRINTS, coming \n               up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck.\n\n               O'Connell quickly looks around, immediately on the alert.\n\n               INT. EVELYN'S CABIN - NIGHT\n\n               Evelyn, wearing a nightgown, stands in front of a mirror.\n\n               She gives her head a good shake, letting her hair fall loose \n               over her bare shoulders. Then she turns around, RIGHT THERE \n               IS ONE OF THE HIDEOUS MUMIA! It's Hook. He slams his hand \n               over her mouth and lifts up his hook, ready to strike.\n\n                                     HOOK\n                         Where is the map?\n\n               Evelyn's terrified eyes glance down. Hook looks over, sees \n               the map lying next to a flickering candle on a nearby table.\n\n                                     HOOK\n                         And the key? Where is the key?\n\n               Evelyn's eyes look confused. She shakes her head. Hook grins.\n\n                                     HOOK\n                         Then I'll find it myself.\n\n               He cocks his hook, about to kill her. And that's when the \n               door is KICKED OPEN. O'Connell BURSTS IN, gun in each hand.\n\n               Hook spins Evelyn around and holds her out in front of him.\n\n               O'Connell looks at her.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Friend of yours?\n\n               Evelyn's eyes widen. And that's when the candle on the table \n               FLICKERS. Everything happens at once, READ FAST: O'Connell \n               spins around just as a window BURSTS OPEN. A Mumia leans in.\n\n               FIRES A GUN. Woodchips BLAST OFF the wall next to O'Connell's \n               head. He returns FIRE. Kills the Mumia. The Mumia falls back.\n\n               FIRING BLINDLY. A LANTERN in the room is BLASTED. Kerosene \n               SPLASHES across the wall. BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Evelyn grabs \n               the candle on the table and JAMS IT back over her shoulder, \n               right into Hook's EYE. He SCREECHES in pain and lets her go.\n\n               O'Connell grabs her and YANKS her out of the FLAMING ROOM.\n\n               HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n               O'Connell pulls Evelyn down the hall, she tries to jerk free.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         The map! We need the map!\n\n               He shoves her up against a wall.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Relax! I'm the map!\n                              (taps his forehead)\n                         It's all up here.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Oh that's comforting.\n\n               O'Connell gives her a look, then pulls her forward.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         C'mon, there's still one more of \n                         those guys around here somewhere.\n\n               EVELYN'S FLAMING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Hot melted wax covers Hook's face as he holds his sore eye \n               and struggles to the door. Then he notices the key/box on \n               the floor. He bends over to pick it up. And that's when the \n               door is KICKED OPEN again, it hits him in the ass and knocks \n               him into the fire. Jonathan leans in. Sees nothing but flames.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         EVY!!\n\n               Then he sees the key/box on the floor and picks it up. A \n               HAND suddenly snatches the key/box away from him.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Hey that's mine --\n\n               It's Hook. His backside is now ON FIRE. He lifts his pistol.\n\n               Jonathan quickly backpedals out the door as Hook OPENS FIRE.\n\n               EXT. CAMEL PADDOCK - NIGHT\n\n               O'Connell and Evelyn race out onto the deck near the horse \n               paddock. People are SCREAMING and SHOUTING, lots of panic.\n\n               BLAM! A chunk of the wall is BLOWN OFF next to Evelyn's head.\n\n               O'Connell pivots and FIRES BACK. It's the last Mumia, on the \n               other side of the paddock. He and O'Connell exchange GUNFIRE.\n\n               Another LANTERN BURSTS INTO FLAMES. O'Connell SHOOTS OFF the \n               paddock lock. The horses go nuts. O'Connell FIRES over their \n               heads. They CHARGE FORWARD and CRASH through the door. The \n               Mumia SCREAMS as the horses STAMPEDE over him. FLAMES sweep \n               up the walls and race across the roof. Half the barge is now \n               ON FIRE. O'Connell throws the gunny-sack over his shoulder.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Can you swim?\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Well of course I can swim, if the \n                         occasion calls for it.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Trust me.\n\n               He picks her up and throws her over the side.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         The occasion calls for it.\n\n               Evelyn SPLASHES into the water. O'Connell dives in after \n               her.\n\n               EXT. BARGE BOW - NIGHT\n\n               Jonathan runs out onto the bow, sees the three Americans, \n               guns in every hand, fanning their pistols, SHOOTING everything \n               in sight. Jonathan just shakes his head.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Americans.\n\n               Hook suddenly stumbles up behind him, -- now a FLAMING TORCH.\n\n               Jonathan turns around, Hook grabs him by the throat with his \n               FLAMING ARM and pins him to the cabin wall. Jonathan's eyes \n               widen as he sees a hook rising up inside the FLAMES about to \n               strike him. The Americans pivot and OPEN FIRE. Blows Hook \n               over the railing. Jonathan turns to the Americans and smiles.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         I say! Good show!\n\n               Then he points his thumb at himself\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         And did I panic?\n\n               He lifts up his other hand, -- he has the key/box back.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         I think not.\n\n               And that's when the horses STAMPEDE onto the bow. Jonathan \n               dives over one side, the three Americans dive over the other.\n\n               NILE RIVERBANK - NIGHT\n\n               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden wade out of the \n               water. Evelyn's nightgown clings tight to her body as she \n               wrings it out. She looks good. O'Connell notices.\n\n               Everybody else, including the horses, is getting out on the \n               far shore O'Connell spots Beni running up to the Americans.\n\n                                     BENI\n                         Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I \n                         got all the horses!\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on \n                         the wrong side of the river!\n\n               Beni looks up at the stars, then angrily KICKS the sand \n               CURSING. The FLAMING barge drifts off, slowly sinking...\n\n               BEDOUIN TRADING POST - DAY\n\n               O'Connell barters in ARABIC with a CAMEL TRADER at a trading \n               post. Jonathan forks over some cash. The Trader hands them \n               the reins of four ugly old camels.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         I can't believe the price of these \n                         fleabags.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         We coulda had 'em for free, all we \n                         had to do was give 'em your sister.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Awfully.\n\n               And that's when Evelyn steps out of a trading tent. She's \n               changed into a gorgeous, tightly fitted, Bedouin dress.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Then again...\n\n               SAHARA DESERT SAND DUNES - DAY\n\n               O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the warden are on camels in \n               the middle of the frying pan; the endless, sunbaked Sahara.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Never did like camels. Filthy buggers. \n                         They smell, they bite, they spit. \n                         Disgusting.\n\n               The warden savagely attacks a chicken wing with his vile \n               green teeth. Flies buzz around his head. He sucks at his \n               gums, then spits out some gristle. O'Connell watches him.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Yeah, disgusting.\n\n               Evelyn is having the time of her life on top of her camel.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Well I think they're cute.\n\n               WE DO SEVERAL TIME DISSOLVES: showing the majesty of the \n               desert, and our heroes getting deeper and deeper into it.\n\n               FRYING PAN - NIGHT\n\n               The MOON shines down an four lone camel rider's trekking \n               across the vast wasteland.\n\n               Jonathan is sound asleep, his head bobbing comically to the \n               rhythm of his camel. On the camel next to him, the Warden \n               SNORES LOUDLY. Up in front of them, Evelyn slowly starts to \n               slide off her saddle. O'Connell reaches over and stops her, \n               then gently pushes her back up onto her saddle, never waking \n               her. For a long moment, his eyes watch Evelyn, and then he \n               looks up at a distant ridge --\n\n               -- where Ardeth Ray and a group of MUMIA RIDERS are pacing \n               them.\n\n               EXT. GIANT SAND DUNE - ENDLESS HORIZON - DAY\n\n               The dawning sun hasn't yet crested the distant horizon as \n               Jonathan and the Warden ride alongside a giant sand dune.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         And you snore!\n\n                                     WARDEN\n                         I do not snore!\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         All night you snored!\n\n                                     WARDEN\n                         I have never snored!\n\n               Up in front of them, O'Connell looks at Evelyn.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         We're almost there.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Are you sure?\n\n               O'Connell looks down at the ground.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Pretty sure.\n\n               The others look down and see DOZENS OF SKELETONS sticking \n               out of the ground. Bleached and eaten away. Some of the \n               skeletons look like they're trying to crawl up out of the \n               desert floor.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         What in bloody hell is this?\n\n               The Warden shivers in fear.\n\n                                     WARDEN\n                         Other seekers of Hamunaptra.\n\n               The American Expedition rides out from behind the far end of \n               the dune. The Americans are accompanied by TWO DOZEN NATIVE \n               DIGGERS and an Arab EGYPTOLOGIST. Beni rides lead on a camel, \n               the rest ride horses.\n\n                                     BENI\n                         Good morning, my friend!\n\n               O'Connell just nods. The two parties come to a stop a hundred \n               feet apart. O'Connell turns and stares out across the endless \n               horizon. Beni does likewise. The Americans look puzzled.\n\n                                     DANIELS\n                         Well, what the hell we doin'?\n\n                                     BENI\n                         Patience, my good sahib, patience.\n\n               Henderson looks over at O'Connell.\n\n                                     HENDERSON\n                         First one to the city, O'Connell! \n                         Five hundred! Cash bucks!\n\n               O'Connell and Beni just stare out at the flat nothingness.\n\n               Evelyn and Jonathan share a look. And then, the SUN starts \n               to rise in the distance, breaking the flat horizon.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Get ready.\n\n               Evelyn can feel the suspense and the majesty of the moment.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         For what?\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         We're about to be shown the way.\n\n               Far off to the right, a HUGE SHAPE begins to rise with the \n               sun. A VOLCANO. O'Connell and Beni watch it, expressionless.\n\n               Daniels, Henderson and Burns share a look, and then --\n\n                                     DANIELS/HENDERSON/BURNS\n                         HEYA!\n\n               The Americans take off. Racing towards the rising volcano.\n\n                                     DANIELS\n                         SEE YA THERE, O'CONNELL!\n\n               Evelyn and Jonathan give O'Connell anxious, sarcastic looks.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't \n                         we be going?\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         After all, you rode us night and day \n                         to win that bet.\n\n               O'Connell doesn't say a word, staring hard.

The strange sound getting louder and \n               louder. And then it stops. Evelyn holds her breath. Jonathan \n               licks his lips. O'Connell cocks his pistol.

You're \n                         dead when they do this\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Still...\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         You two are worse than a couple of \n                         schoolboys.\n\n               And that's when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly GIVES OUT.\n\n               O'Connell GRABS Evelyn and JERKS her clear. Jonathan DIVES \n               for the far wall. A MASSIVE STONE CASEMENT DROPS OUT OF THE \n               CEILING AND CRASHES to the floor. DUST FLIES. Fills the room.\n\n               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER\n\n               Having heard the crash, Beni and the Americans have their \n               guns pointed at the floor. The Egyptologist could care less, \n               he looks at the Diggers, gripping their crowbars, and YELLS --\n\n                                     EGYPTOLOGIST\n                         FENI!\n\n               The three Diggers PULL HARD. The ancient seams start to give, \n               The Egyptologist YELLS again. The Diggers PULL HARDER. The \n               compartment starts to loosen. Again he YELLS. The Diggers \n               give one final pull and --\n\n               -- AN INTENSE BURST OF LIQUID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM. HITS \n               THE THREE DIGGERS. MELTS THEIR SKIN CLEAN OFF. They SCREAM.\n\n               Dying horribly. HALF SKELETAL by the time they hit the \n               ground...\n\n               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY\n\n               The dust is starting to clear. O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan \n               slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement.\n\n               We immediately recognize it as IMHOTEP'S SARCOPHAGUS.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks \n                         like a sarcophagus.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Why would they bury somebody in the \n                         ceiling?\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         They didn't, they buried him at the \n                         foot of Anubis. He was either someone \n                         of great importance. Or he did \n                         something very naughty.\n\n               INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY\n\n               The warden drops an amethyst-scarab into his pouch, then \n               greedily starts prying away at another. It rips off, he drops \n               it into his pouch, -- only he misses, and this scarab quietly \n               falls to the sandy floor without the Warden noticing.\n\n               CLOSE ON: the scarab on the floor. It begins to TRANSFORM.\n\n               The amethyst starts to glow. Something inside starts to \n               WIGGLE; as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon.\n\n               Then it splits open and a real live hideous SCARAB BEETLE \n               scurries out. It races over to the warden's shoe, quickly \n               burrows into the leather and vanishes inside.\n\n               The Warden's eyes FLY OPEN. He starts to SCREAM, drops his \n               knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg, \n               higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a \n               large, hideous LUMP, BURROWING UNDER HIS SKIN. IT BURROWS \n               IT'S WAY UP HIS FAT BELLY AND ACROSS HIS HAIRY CHEST. The \n               Warden claws and scratches at it, trying to stop it. The \n               lump BURROWS UP HIS NECK. The Warden starts GAGGING and \n               COUGHING.\n\n               And then the scarab-lump VANISHES INTO HIS HEAD.\n\n               INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY\n\n               Our Heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus, \n               revealing a single, ominous hieroglyph. Evelyn stares at it \n               Jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Well?... Who is it?\n\n               Evelyn stares at the hieroglyph, confused and concerned.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         'He that shall not be named.'\n\n               O'Connell dusts off the huge LOCK\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         There's some sort of lock here. You \n                         say these thing's are made of granite \n                         with a steel interior?\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting \n                         out.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         No kiddin', without a key, it'll \n                         take us a month to crack this thing,\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         A key! That's it! That's what he was \n                         talking about.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Who was talking about what?\n\n               Evelyn starts rummaging through the pack on Jonathan's back.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         The man on the barge. The one with \n                         the hook, he was looking for a key.\n\n               Evelyn pulls out the key/box. Jonathan tries to take it back.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Hey that's mine!\n\n               Evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box, -- it's \n               now shaped exactly like the LOCK'S KEYHOLE. Evelyn smiles.\n\n               And that's when they hear the Warden's SCREAMS echoing through \n               the labyrinth. All three of them turn and take-off running.\n\n               INT. LABYRINTH - DAY\n\n               The Warden is SCREAMING and dancing insanely around the \n               labyrinth, totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head.\n\n               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan run up just as the Warden \n               starts RIPPING his own hair out of his head. O'Connell and \n               Jonathan grab at the Warden's hands, but he's far too crazed, \n               he shoves them aside, runs full bore down the length of the \n               labyrinth and SLAMS his head straight into a rock wall. The \n               Warden drops to the ground. Dead as lead. Eyes wide open.\n\n               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan just stand there staring, \n               breathing hard, wide-eyed themselves...\n\n               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT\n\n               Evelyn and Jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         What do you suppose killed him?\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Did you ever see him eat?\n\n               O'Connell comes up over some rocks.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Seems the Americans had a little \n                         misadventure of their own today, \n                         three of their diggers were killed.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         How?\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. \n                         Some sort of ancient booby-trap.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Maybe this place really is cursed.\n\n               A GUST OF WIND blows through the camp.\n\n               The campfire FLICKERS O'Connell and Jonathan share a nervous \n               look. Evelyn laughs.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         You two!\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         You don't believe in curses, huh?\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         No. I believe if I can see it and I \n                         can touch it, then it's real. That's \n                         what I believe.\n\n               O'Connell cocks his rifle, KA-CHANK! Gives her a big grin.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         I believe in being prepared.\n\n               Jonathan opens the Warden's POUCH, the one that held the \n               scarabs. He reaches in, starts scrounging around. WE SLOWLY \n               PUSH IN. Waiting for the attack. THE MUSIC BUILDS. And then, --\n               Jonathan SCREAMS in pain and RIPS his hand back out of the \n               pouch. O'Connell and Evelyn both jump.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL/EVELYN\n                         WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!\n\n               Jonathan sucks his finger, then reaches back into the pouch \n               and pulls out a LIQUOR BOTTLE, the top has been chipped off.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Seagrams!\n\n               Jonathan smiles at the bottle, then turns the pouch inside \n               out and shakes it, nothing but SAND is inside it.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Well, he may have been a stinky \n                         fellow,... but he had good taste.\n\n               Jonathan takes a swig. O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, guiltily \n               And then O'Connell suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear \n               to the sand. Evelyn and Jonathan watch him. A BEAT. And then \n               a BARAGE OF GUNFIRE IS HEARD coming from the American camp.\n\n               O'Connell jumps up and throws the elephant gun to Evelyn.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Stay here!\n\n               He takes off running through the ruins. Evelyn immediately \n               gets up and runs after him. Jonathan grabs a gun, holds the \n               bottle of Seagrams; tight and dashes after her.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Evy! Excuse me! But didn't the man \n                         just say -- !\n\n               EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - NIGHT\n\n               The American camp is under siege. Two dozen MUMIA RIDERS \n               gallop through. FIRING RIFLES. Several Diggers are killed as \n               they run. The Americans leap out of their tents FIRING. Kill \n               multiple Riders. Daniels is shot, spins and falls, keeps \n               SHOOTING. Henderson and Burns run to his aid, BLASTING AWAY.\n\n               O'Connell races through the ruins and SLAMS right into Beni, \n               who is obviously trying to high-tail-it out of there.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Goin' somewhere?\n\n                                     BENI\n                         Just looking for you, O'Connell! I \n                         wanted to be with my friend!\n\n               O'Connell drags him back towards the American camp.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         C'mon, friend.\n\n                                     BENI\n                              (struggling)\n                         Why do you like to fight so much?\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         'Cause I look good doin, it.\n\n               Ardeth Ray gallops through the camp, cutting Diggers down \n               with his scimitar. O'Connell runs up on top of some rocks, \n               LEAPS OUT and TACKLES him off his horse. The two men SLAM to \n               the ground. O'Connell spins up onto one knee and FIRES, point \n               blank. Blows the scimitar out of Ardeth Ray's hand. O'Connell \n               is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them.\n\n               A scimitar swoops down, almost takes O'Connell's head off, \n               misses him by an inch. O'Connell leaps up and blows the Rider \n               off his mount. The horse BOLTS. -- But Ardeth Ray is gone.\n\n               Evelyn hides behind some rocks, watching the scene, suddenly, \n               she hears something coming up behind her and spins around.\n\n               A vicious tattooed Mumia Rider races at her. Evelyn quickly \n               backpedals over the rocks, terrified. The Mumia Rider raises \n               his scimitar, about to strike.\n\n               Evelyn SCREAMS, trips over a rock and FIRES the elephant \n               gun, -- BLAM! Blows the Rider off his mount and CATAPULTS \n               him twenty feet back into some ruins.\n\n               At the same time, the kick blows Evelyn off her feet and \n               over a ridge. She FLAILS through the air and lands in a sand \n               dune.\n\n               Jonathan and some Diggers are holding their own near the \n               temple door. Four Riders come CHARGING right at them.\n\n               Jonathan takes a swig off the Seagrams.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Let 'em have it, boys!\n\n               Jonathan and the Diggers OPEN FIRE. When the smoke clears, \n               the Riders are either dead or gone. Jonathan grins.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         I say, bloody good show.\n\n               And then several more Mumia leap off the temple and land \n               behind them. Jonathan and the remaining Diggers spin around \n               and suddenly find themselves in hand-to-hand combat.\n\n               O'Connell is quickly loading his pistol. He hears something \n               THUNDERING UP behind him. He spins around just as Ardeth Ray \n               on a horse swings his scimitar. O'Connell instinctively raises \n               his hands to protect his face, the scimitar STRIKES!\n\n               Hits his gun, -- CHING! O'Connell's gun flips away. Disarmed, \n               O'Connell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick \n               of dynamite in his hand. He shoves the fuse into a fire. It \n               IGNITES. He faces Ardeth Ray, towering above him. The two \n               men lock eyes. The fuse continues to burn down. Ardeth Ray \n               points his scimitar at O'Connell's head.\n\n                                     ARDETH RAY\n                         LEAVE THIS PLACE!... LEAVE THIS PLACE \n                         OR DIE!\n\n               Ardeth Ray GALLOPS OFF. The remaining Mumia Riders race after \n               him, vanishing into the night. O'Connell watches them leave, \n               then turns to the burning fuse,... and blows it out. Evelyn \n               staggers up, looking very shaken. O'Connell gently takes her \n               and holds her close.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         You alright?\n\n               Evelyn looks up into his strong eyes. It's the first time \n               he's shown genuine concern for her. And she likes it. He's \n               also holding her a little too close. And she likes that too.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Yes,... fine,... thank you.\n\n               Beni crawls out from under some pillars as Henderson and \n               Burns help Daniels to his feet.\n\n                                     DANIELS\n                         See!

And then his eyes close \n               and his mouth widens into a goofy smile. Shit-faced drunk.\n\n               O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, both half-in-the-bag themselves, \n               the bottle of Seagrams is almost gone. O'Connell offers the \n               bottle to Evelyn, she waves it away, slurring badly --\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Unlike my brother, sir, I know when \n                         to say no.\n\n               O'Connell polishes off the bottle and chucks it away.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Unlike your brother, Miss, you I \n                         don't get.

He leans forward and KISSES \n               HER. Evelyn's eyes slowly close. And then she passes out, \n               slumping into his arms.

Evelyn's face drops, \n               appalled and embarrassed. And that's when the lid FALLS OFF \n               and LOUDLY CRASHES to the ground.

ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY\n\n               The vapor is settling. The Americans have their guns aimed \n               at the chest. The Egyptologist slowly steps up, reaches \n               inside, and lifts out a heavy burlap bag. Everyone's eyes \n               widen in excitement as he sticks his hand into the bag and \n               slowly pulls out the black BOOK OF THE DEAD, the same book \n               Imhotep used in his attempt to bring Anck-su-namun back to \n               life.\n\n                                     EGYPTOLOGIST\n                         I have heard told of this book, but \n                         I never truly believed it existed. \n                         This, good gentlemen, is a most \n                         priceless treasure.\n\n               Henderson kicks the sandy floor in anger.\n\n                                     HENDERSON\n                         I wouldn't trade ya for a brass \n                         spittoon!\n\n                                     DANIELS\n                         Yeah!

BASE CAMP - NIGHT\n\n               The two camps have now joined together. O'Connell and Beni \n               are roasting chunks of hairy meat over a fire.

CAMP - LATER THAT NIGHT\n\n               Having just freshened up for bed, Evelyn exits the temple \n               and steps past the sleeping Diggers. She spots the \n               Egyptologist, his jeweled canopic jar snug under one arm, \n               the Book Of The Dead laying loose under the other. Evelyn \n               stares at the Book, nervously biting her lip, then she sneaks \n               over, carefully steals it, and quickly tip-toes away.\n\n               Lying on some blankets by the campfire, O'Connell rolls over \n               and sees Evelyn, sitting wide-eyed, staring at the Book.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         You sure you outta be playin, around \n                         with that?\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         It's just a book, no harm ever came \n                         from a book.\n\n               Evelyn opens the cover. THE FIRE FLICKERS. She and O'Connell \n               share a nervous look, then Evelyn shrugs and starts reading.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Ahm kum Ra.

IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - NIGHT\n\n               Evelyn's VOICE is OVERLAID as WE START WIDE on Imhotep's \n               chamber and SLOWLY PUSH IN on his sarcophagus. WE PUSH IN \n               over the lip of the coffin, then closer and closer towards \n               Imhotep's rotten, twisted head, until his putrid face fills \n               FRAME, -- and then suddenly his crusty eyelids Pop OPEN!\n\n               Revealing EMPTY SOCKETS. -- BIG SCARY MUSIC STING.\n\n               EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT\n\n               The Egyptologist sits bolt upright. Quickly looks around, \n               sees Evelyn reading the Book.

O'Connell and the others all \n               leap to their feet. The Americans run out of their tents.\n\n               The SOUND gets LOUDER and CLOSER. And then from out of the \n               darkness a HUGE WALL OF LOCUSTS SWIRLS into camp and envelops \n               everyone. O'Connell grabs Evelyn, and with Jonathan at their \n               side they race for the crevice, trying to fend off the horrid \n               vermin as they go. Beni and the Americans run for the temple.\n\n               The Egyptologist is covered in locusts.

The horrible herd of vicious scarabs \n               scurries between them, their ear-piercing CHITTERS send \n               shivers up Evelyn's spine. She leans back. THE WALL MOVES.\n\n               Evelyn falls backwards through an opening. O'Connell and \n               Jonathan watch the scarabs vanish up the staircase. Then \n               they look across the way. Evelyn is gone.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         EVY!?\n\n               SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT\n\n               Evelyn sits up, shakes the sand out of her hair, fearfully \n               looks around. It's almost PITCH BLACK. She gets up and feels \n               her way along the dark walls. She rounds a corner. A shaft \n               of MOONLIGHT filters in through a crack in the ceiling. A \n               MAN stands in the middle of the room. Evelyn walks towards \n               him.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Oh thank goodness, you're one of the \n                         Americans, aren't you?\n\n               Just as she reaches him he turns around. It's Burns. BOTH OF \n               HIS EYES ARE MISSING. He stares at her with vacant sockets.\n\n               Evelyn SCREAMS in horror and backs away, hyperventilating, \n               she bumps into something. She SCREAMS again and spins around \n               It's Imhotep. With two fresh EYEBALLS in his sockets.\n\n               Evelyn SCREAMS again and backs away into a wall. Her hair is \n               down, her face is dirty and sweaty, her blouse is ripped, \n               her dress is torn, she's never looked sexier. Imhotep SQUINTS.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         Anck-su-namun?\n\n               LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT\n\n               O'Connell is feeling his way around inside the grotto\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Damn-it! Must be a trap door around \n                         here or somethin'.\n\n               And then they heat MEN SCREAMING, and suddenly, Henderson, \n               Daniels and one of the Diggers come running down the stairs.\n\n                                     HENDERSON\n                         RUN, YOU SONS-A-BITCHES! RUUUUN!\n\n               O'Connell and Jonathan join them as they hear the herd of \n               CHITTERING scarabs coming their way. The Digger suddenly \n               trips and falls. O'Connell slows down, about to go back and \n               help him. But it's too late. The Digger SCREAMS in horror as \n               the herd of scarabs run over him, eating straight through \n               him, leaving behind the Digger's half eaten skeleton. Daniels \n               Henderson and Jonathan react in horror. O'Connell's already \n               running, races right past them. The others turn and haul \n               ass.\n\n               SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT\n\n               Imhotep steps forward, -- the sand around him seems to \n               MAGNETIZE, swirling and dancing around his flaking skeletal \n               legs. Evelyn starts backing away, horrified, looks at Burns\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Help me,... please,... help me.\n\n               Burns opens his mouth, but can only GURGLE and MOAN because \n               HIS TONGUE IS MISSING. Imhotep grabs him, throws him to the \n               ground and sets his skeletal foot on Burns' chest, like a \n               big game hunter standing on his kill. Imhotep then parts his \n               fetid lips, -- A FRESH TONGUE FLAPS BETWEEN HIS ROTTED TEETH.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         Kadeesh pharos Anck-su-namun!\n\n               Evelyn shivers in fear. Suddenly, O'Connell comes flying \n               around the corner and runs right up to her.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Would you quit playin, around! Let's \n                         get outta here already!\n\n               O'Connell sees the look in her eyes and turns around, -- at \n               the sight of Imhotep, O'Connell jumps back in fright.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         WHOA!\n\n               O'Connell and Evelyn start backing away down the wall.\n\n               Imhotep glides sideways with them, like a tiger cornering \n               his prey, the sand around him SWIRLS and DANCES. Burns starts \n               to crawl away, whimpering as he goes. Imhotep suddenly stops \n               and UNHINGES his skeletal jaw, his skinless mouth stretches \n               to an inhuman size, and he lets out a horrific, primordial \n               SHRIEK.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!\n\n               Evelyn SCREAMS. O'Connell shudders, then, embarrassed by his \n               fear, he opens his own mouth and ROARS right back at him --\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Ahhhhhhhh!!\n\n               Then BLASTS him with the elephant gun, --BLAM! Through the \n               SMOKE AND FLAMMAGE we see Imhotep blown off his feet, his \n               ribcage half torn away. O'Connell grabs Evelyn and runs.\n\n               EXT. CREVICE - NIGHT\n\n               SAND and WIND whip through the ruins as O'Connell and Evelyn \n               stumble up out of the crevice and COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH TEN \n               ARMED MUMIA. The Mumia quickly raise their guns. O'Connell \n               and Evelyn quickly raise their hands. Jonathan, Henderson, \n               Daniels and the Egyptologist are already on their knees, \n               hands over their heads. Ardeth Ray steps forward.\n\n                                     ARDETH RAY\n                         I told you to leave or die, you \n                         refused, and now you may have killed \n                         us all.

Really \n                         big mouth? Really bad breath?\n\n               INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - NIGHT\n\n               Beni slowly backs up around Anubis, eyes wide, gun up. He \n               turns around, -- IMHOTEP IS RIGHT THERE! Beni SCREAMS, backs \n               away and OPENS FIRE. Six GUNSHOTS perforate Imhotep, but \n               have no effect except to SPLATTER molten flesh rot onto the \n               back wall. Beni retreats into a corner, scared shitless.\n\n               Imhotep moves forward, his one hand trying to stop the molten \n               mummy guts from oozing out of the large shotgun hole in his \n               side. Beni drops his gun and grabs at the CHAINS around his \n               neck, RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS AND ICONS dangle from each chain.\n\n               Beni holds the first one up: A CHRISTIAN CRUCIFIX. He quickly \n               makes the sign of-the cross and blesses himself in English:\n\n                                     BENI\n                         May the good Lord protect and watch \n                         over me as a shepherd watches over \n                         his flock. And may Satan in all his \n                         forms be vanquished forever.\n\n               It has no effect on Imhotep, who continues forward. Beni \n               quickly grabs at the other symbols and icons, holding them \n               out towards Imhotep, one after the other, trying to slow his \n               progress: an Islamic Sword and Crescent Moon necklace; a \n               Hindu Brahma medallion; a small Buddhist Bodhisattva statue.\n\n               All while blessing himself in Arabic, Hindi, Chinese and \n               Latin. Nothing works. Imhotep's skeletal hand reaches for \n               Beni's throat. Tears run down Beni's cheeks he's so freaked.\n\n               And that's when he holds up THE STAR OF DAVID and blesses \n               himself in HEBREW. Imhotep stops in his tracks. His hand \n               lowers. His grotesque new eyeballs stare at Beni.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                              (subtitled)\n                         The language of the slaves.\n\n               Looks at him quizzically. Imhotep takes a step back.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                              (in Hebrew -- subtitled)\n                         I may have use for you. And the \n                         rewards will be great.\n\n               Imhotep reaches into his tattered robe, and then holds out \n               his fetid hand, filled with squirming MAGGOTS. Beni cringes, \n               about to throw up, but then the maggots part, -- revealing a \n               tiny pile of little JEWELS. Beni's eyes widen. Imhotep raises \n               his other hand, it holds Anck-su-namun's BROKEN CANOPIC JAR.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         Where are the other sacred jars?\n\n               EXT.

O'Connell stares at it, \n               shocked, then quickly YANKS his fist back out. The area of \n               Imhotep's face that came into contact with O'Connell's fist \n               quickly DEGENERATES and DECAYS, right down to the bone, as \n               if O'Connell's hand instantly infected it.\n\n               Imhotep angrily turns, grabs O'Connell, and with no effort, \n               THROWS him across the room and into Jonathan and the others \n               knocking them down. Imhotep looks at his hand, the one that \n               just grabbed O'Connell, -- IT STARTS TO SHRIVEL and DECAY.\n\n               He quickly turns to Evelyn. Evelyn backs away into a wall, \n               terrorized. Imhotep steps up to her.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         You saved me from the undead.

It's \n               Imhotep, having regenerated even further. He looks up and \n               catches eyes with O'Connell. Imhotep grins, then UNHINGES; \n               his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and then a \n               huge SWARM OF FLIES comes out of his mouth and races straight \n               up at O'Connell and Jonathan. They both SLAM the shutters.\n\n               The flies SLAM into the closed window and immediately spread \n               throughout the bazaar. Sending people SCREAMING and running.\n\n               EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT\n\n               O'Connell and Jonathan look at each other, panicked.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Damn-it!

More Soldiers march the encircling parapet.\n\n                                     SOLDIER\n                         Ten o'clock! All is well!\n\n               The lights and MUSIC from the Casbah come up from below\n\n               INT. EVELYN'S FOYER - NIGHT\n\n               Daniels turns from the window. Henderson sits in a chair \n               next to Evelyn's door, chain smoking. Both look wired with \n               fear.\n\n                                     DANIELS\n                         The hell with this. I'm goin, \n                         downstairs to get me a drink. You \n                         want somethin'?\n\n                                     HENDERSON\n                         Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a \n                         shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.\n\n               Daniels nods and heads out. Henderson just sits there, alone, \n               smoking. He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out his \n               SACRED CANOPIC JAR and fondles it. A BREEZE suddenly comes \n               in through the open window. The curtains flutter. Henderson \n               gets up and goes over to shut it. He looks out the window.\n\n               The CAMERA races over the compound, into the window and HITS \n               Henderson square in the FACE just as he's about to scream.\n\n               Henderson is lifted into the air by a mass of SWIRLING SAND.\n\n               His body TWISTS and TURNS and slowly SHRIVELS as the life is \n               SUCKED out of him.\n\n               Then he COLLAPSES to the floor. On the wall above him, the \n               SHADOW of the SWIRLING SAND condenses, forming a SHADOW of a \n               human body. The SHADOW CONVULSES as the body REGENERATES.\n\n               And then it's over.\n\n               Imhotep steps into view. He's regenerated even further and \n               looks almost normal now, his face no longer decayed. He steps \n               over Henderson's shriveled body and up to Evelyn's door, \n               rattles the knob. It's locked. Imhotep grins.\n\n               EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Evelyn is asleep in her bed as SAND begins streaming in \n               through the keyhole, pouring onto the floor, forming a large \n               mound. Evelyn starts to toss and turn. WE PAN BACK OVER TO \n               THE DOOR: The mound of sand is gone and in it's place is \n               Imhotep.\n\n               INT. FOYER - NIGHT\n\n               O'Connell and Jonathan race into the foyer and skid to a \n               stop as they see Henderson's shriveled body on the floor.\n\n               O'Connell runs up to Evelyn's door and rattles the knob, \n               still locked. He bends down and looks in through the KEYHOLE.\n\n               EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Imhotep leans down towards Evelyn, about to kiss her as she \n               sleeps. The door starts to CRASH and BANG from O'Connell.\n\n               Imhotep ignores it. And KISSES Evelyn. His lips and mouth \n               instantly start to DEGENERATE and DECAY. Right down to the \n               bone. The door BURSTS OPEN. Evelyn wakes up. Sees Imhotep's \n               rotted mouth kissing her. She SCREAMS and shoves him away.\n\n               Imhotep's putrid mouth grimaces in sadness.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Get your hands off my girl, pal.\n\n               Imhotep's sadness turns to anger as he spins around and faces \n               O'Connell. Imhotep licks his fetid lips. O'Connell smirks.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Nice lips.\n\n               Imhotep starts to move for O'Connell.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         I figured you might be here, so I \n                         brought a friend.\n\n               He throws the white cat at Imhotep. Imhotep instinctively \n               catches it.\n\n               He SHRIEKS, drops the cat and stumbles back towards the \n               window, -- which suddenly BLOWS OPEN. Imhotep spins like a \n               dervish and BURSTS INTO A WHIRLWIND OF SAND.\n\n               Everybody covers their eyes. The Imhotep/sand-devil EXPLODES \n               out the window and vanishes over the compound.\n\n               Jonathan aims his gun at the window, his hand shaking badly.\n\n               O'Connell hugs Evelyn as she wipes her mouth in disgust.\n\n               Daniels walks in, looks at Henderson's shriveled body on the \n               floor... and drops the martini glasses.\n\n               INT. 1923 CONVERTIBLE DUSSENBERG - NIGHT\n\n               Jonathan races his big convertible through the streets, \n               HONKING constantly. Evelyn sits between him and O'Connell, \n               looking scared and nervous, then she gives O'Connell a look.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         You called me your girl?\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         What?...

You kiddin' me? Did you see \n                         that guy's face?\n\n               Daniels leans forward from the back seat, filled with fear,\n\n                                     DANIELS\n                         Shut-up!

CAIRO BAZAAR - NIGHT\n\n               A FULL MOON now shines down on the bazaar, still bustling \n               with activity. Suddenly, a BREEZE kicks-in. GREEN MIST begins \n               to SWIRL down the street and through the stalls. The people \n               begin to CHOKE and COUGH and RETCH, as if being hit by a \n               severe sickness -- it's already too late.\n\n               Imhotep strolls through the sickened mob, his face half rotted \n               off, his deformed mouth grinning happily. Beni is at his \n               side, looking very nervous.\n\n               And then, one-by-one, the people silently begin to follow \n               Imhotep, their skin now covered in disgustingly hideous BOILS \n               AND SORES.\n\n               INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - NIGHT\n\n               O'Connell., Jonathan, Daniels, the Curator and Ardeth Ray \n               follow Evelyn as she strides through the museum.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Last month I came across an \n                         inscription that mentioned The Book \n                         Of The Dead.\n\n                                     DANIELS\n                         That book we found at Hamunaptra?\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Yes.

Beni steps out of the museum and sees them.\n\n                                     BENI\n                         Imhotep! IMHOTEP!\n\n               Imhotep looks out of the museum from the shattered upper \n               windows just as the convertible PEELS OUT. O'Connell points \n               a finger at Beni as they race past him.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         You're gonna get yours, pal!\n\n               Imhotep UNHINGES his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman \n               size, he lets out one of his horrific, primordial SHRIEKS.\n\n               His disease-ridden disciples immediately begin pouring out \n               of the front doors of the museum and chasing after the car.\n\n               EXT. BAZAAR - NIGHT\n\n               The convertible hauls ass down the narrow bazaar street.\n\n               Crazies start jumping out of stalls and LEAPING onto the \n               car. O'Connell and the others fight them off, throwing them \n               overboard. More people JUMP on. Jonathan SWERVES the car, \n               CRASHES through some stalls, knocking them off, but not before \n               they manage to open the back door and YANK Daniels out. He \n               TUMBLES across the pavement. Gets up SHOOTING. Backs into a \n               corner, FIRING his pistol into the hideous rabble, killing \n               several, keeping them at bay. His gun goes empty, CLICK! \n               CLICK! CLICK! But the mob stays back, looking at him like \n               rabid vultures. Daniels eyes them, filled with fear.\n\n               The mob parts like the red sea as Imhotep walks through them \n               and up to Daniels. Daniels whimpers in fear, tears pour down \n               his cheeks. Then he gets an idea, reaches into his pocket, \n               and pulls out his jewel encrusted SACRED CANOPIC JAR. He \n               holds it out for Imhotep. Imhotep takes it and grins. Through \n               his tears, Daniels grins back, hopeful that he'll be spared.\n\n               WE CUT WIDE: Somewhere in the middle of the crazed, diseased \n               mob, we hear Daniels give out A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM...\n\n               INT./EXT. CONVERTIBLE - STREETS - NIGHT\n\n               The convertible slowly motors down the narrow alleys. WE \n               DOLLY across the hood of the car from Jonathan to Evelyn to \n               O'Connell. Ardeth Ray and the Curator are still in the back.\n\n               All of them staring out the front windshield. Freaked-out.\n\n               Then suddenly one of the hideous ghouls CRASHES through the \n               windshield! Everybody SCREAMS. Jonathan hits the gas, loses \n               control, the car SLAMS into a wall. O'Connell grabs Evelyn.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         C'mon! C'mon! Let's go! Let's go!\n\n               They all leap out of the car. But the angry, festering mob \n               quickly surrounds them. O'Connell quickly reaches into his \n               gunny-sack, pulls out a stick of dynamite, then reaches into \n               his pocket and pulls out a match. He looks around for a way \n               to light it, then reaches over and strikes it across Ardeth \n               Ray's stubbly face. Ardeth Ray YELPS. O'Connell holds the \n               lit match near the fuse.\n\n               The crazed, CHANTING mob gives O'Connell a wide berth, staring \n               at him and the others with insane, bloodshot eyes.\n\n               And then Imhotep steps through, -- having fully regenerated, \n               he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did \n               the day he was buried alive. Evelyn stares at him.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         He's gorgeous.\n\n               O'Connell gives her a look, the match burns his fingers. He \n               YELPS and throws it down, grabs another match and strikes it \n               across Ardeth Ray's face again. Ardeth Ray YELPS and gives \n               O'Connell a look to kill. The Curator shakes his head.\n\n                                     THE CURATOR\n                         He has consummated the curse, now \n                         all he need do is raise Anck-su-namun \n                         from the dead, then it will be the \n                         end of us, and the beginning for \n                         them.\n\n               Imhotep moves forward, heading right for them. O'Connell \n               LIGHTS THE FUSE. Imhotep steps up to O'Connell and stops, \n               watching the fuse burn down. it's a game of chicken. The \n               tension mounts. The LIT FUSE is about to vanish inside the \n               stick of dynamite, blowing it up, -- when Evelyn leans forward \n               and blows it out. O'Connell exhales, but keeps his eyes on \n               Imhotep, who extends his hand to Evelyn.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         Koontash dai na.\n\n               Beni steps through the swarming mass, translating.\n\n                                     BENI\n                         Take his hand and he will spare the \n                         others.\n\n               Evelyn hesitates, looks around at the huge, bloodthirsty \n               crowd surrounding them, holding axes, picks and scimitars, \n               waiting to pounce, then she looks at Imhotep, confident, \n               powerful, invincible. Then she looks at O'Connell.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Any bright ideas?\n\n               O'Connell talks through angry, grit teeth.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Sorry, fresh out.\n\n               Evelyn looks back at Imhotep, then starts to reach out to \n               take his hand. Both O'Connell and Jonathan move to stop her, -- \n               but Ardeth Ray grabs them both and holds them tight.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Don't do it, Evelyn.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         I have no choice.\n\n               Evelyn's trembling hand touches Imhotep's: His hand closes \n               around hers. Nothing happens. Imhotep smiles.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         Keetah mi pharos, aja nilo, isirlan.\n\n                                     BENI\n                         Come with me my princess. It is time \n                         to make you mine, forever.\n\n               Evelyn gives Beni a nasty look, correcting him --\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         All eternity, idiot.\n\n               Then she looks at O'Connell and puts on her best face.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         You better think of something, because \n                         if he turns me into a mummy, you're \n                         the first one I'm coming after.\n\n               O'Connell almost smiles.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Got guts, lady.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep \n                         them.\n\n               Imhotep suddenly notices something. He reaches forward and -- \n               RIPS THE KEY/BOX OUT OF JONATHAN'S UPPER JACKET POCKET.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Hey that's mine -- !\n\n               Ardeth Ray holds Jonathan back. Imhotep pulls Evelyn away.\n\n               O'Connell can't take it anymore, he tries to break free of \n               Ardeth Ray's grip.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Evelyn!\n\n               The huge, powerful man holds him tight.\n\n                                     ARDETH RAY\n                         Be calm. There is still time. We can \n                         stop him yet.\n\n               The crowd parts for Imhotep and Evelyn. And then Imhotep \n               stops and looks back at O'Connell.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         Pared oos.\n\n               Evelyn SCREAMS.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         NOOO!!\n\n               Beni smiles.\n\n                                     BENI\n                         Kill them.\n\n               Imhotep pulls her away.

The Curator pushes Ardeth Ray towards the cistern hole.\n\n                                     CURATOR\n                         Go! Find a way!

He throws the machine-gun over one shoulder, a \n               cartridge belt over the other and staggers away. O'Connell \n               and Jonathan look into the cockpit. Winston Havlock is dead.\n\n               A smile on his face.

It comes loose in \n               his hand. He looks at the scarab in his palm. It starts to \n               glow. And then something inside it starts to WIGGLE.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Say, gents!

Jonathan starts to freak out and SCREAM.\n\n               O'Connell runs up and rips the arm off Jonathan's shirt. The \n               scarab is now BURROWING UP JONATHAN'S ARM. O'Connell whips \n               out his butterfly-knife, snaps it open and grabs Jonathan's \n               arm. Jonathan's eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in \n               front of his face. Jonathan SCREAMS LOUDER, obviously being \n               cut open. O'Connell's hand flicks something away.\n\n               The scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying \n               back towards Jonathan, wanting to finish the job.\n\n               O'Connell pulls out his gun and blows it away, -- BLAM!\n\n               INT.

He pulls out the crusted remains of Anck-su-namun's \n               heart, crushes it to dust in his hand and starts reading \n               from The Book Of The Dead. Then he BLOWS the dust against a \n               mausoleum wall, -- THE WALL STARTS TO COME ALIVE.\n\n               Evelyn and Beni stare at the wall, both of them wide-eyed.\n\n               TWO FORMS emerge from the mausoleum's wall. Horrific-looking \n               mummified CORPSES. Two of Imhotep's long dead Priests.\n\n               They bow to Imhotep, then turn and move off down a passageway.\n\n               INT.

Imhotep stares at her, cold, \n               malevolent, then he turns and walks off into the mausoleums.\n\n               Beni nervously glances around, then quickly scurries away.\n\n               TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY\n\n               O'Connell squeezes through a small crevice in a wall and \n               drops to the floor of a dark chamber. He picks up his \n               gunnysack and scans the darkness. Something GLITTERS. Jonathan \n               and Ardeth Ray crawl in behind him.\n\n               O'Connell notices a SHAFT OF LIGHT, high above him, shooting \n               through a small hole in the ceiling and stopping against a \n               wall next to one of those mirror disks. O'Connell aims his \n               gun. FIRES. The bullet STRIKES the disk's pedestal, spinning \n               the mirror into the shaft of light, -- And WHAM! THE SHAFT \n               OF LIGHT HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY BOUNCES AROUND THE ROOM \n               FROM ONE DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP.\n\n               It's an enormous TREASURE CHAMBER. Filled to overflowing. \n               Everything sparkles and shines. The wealth of Egypt.\n\n               O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray are speechless. That's \n               when the two mummified Priest-mummies walk in.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Who the hell are these guys?\n\n                                     ARDETH RAY\n                         Priests. Imhotep's priests.\n\n               O'Connell pulls the elephant gun out of his gunny-sack.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         I never killed a priest before.\n\n                                     ARDETH RAY\n                         They are evil, cursed, they matter \n                         not.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Well, okay then.\n\n               O'Connell FIRES the elephant gun. SMOKE and FLAME shoot out.\n\n               BLASTS one of the mummies. Blows it's upper torso clean off.\n\n               O'Connell pumps the gun, the huge spent cartridge flips \n               through the air. He FIRES again. BLASTS the other mummy, \n               blows this one's torso clean off as well. The smoke clears.\n\n               The two sets of LEGS keep walking forward, unaffected by the \n               loss of their upper torsos. O'Connell can't believe it.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Oh come on, gimme a break here.\n\n               And then the disemboweled upper torsos start to move, turning \n               over and crawling towards our heroes, who start to back away.\n\n               INT. CEMETERY - DAY\n\n               Imhotep turns from the altar as he hears more GUNSHOTS echoing \n               out of the passageways. He angrily reaches into another of \n               Anck-su-namun's canopic jars, pulls out her crusty liver and \n               crushes it to dust, then quickly starts reading a passage \n               from the Book and BLOWS the dust down a passageway.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                              (ancient Egyptian -- \n                              subtitled)\n                         Kill them! Kill them all! And bring \n                         me the Book Of The Living!\n\n               INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY\n\n               A dusty BREEZE blows into the chamber as O'Connell, Jonathan \n               and Ardeth Ray back away from the mummy pieces. The floor \n               where they were just standing suddenly STARTS TO MOVE. Two \n               more mummies slowly dig their way up out of the floor. More \n               mummies start coming out of the walls and crawling out of \n               the piles of gold. All the mummies head for our heroes.\n\n               O'Connell lifts the elephant gun. Ardeth Ray stops him.\n\n                                     ARDETH RAY\n                         My turn.\n\n               Ardeth Ray OPENS UP with the Lewis gun. BLASTING the shit \n               out of the mummies. They keep on coming. Even more now.\n\n               O'Connell OPENS FIRE with the elephant gun, pumping and FIRING \n               as all three of the men back away and haul ass. The mummies \n               and mummy pieces follow them into the passageway.\n\n               Then Beni creeps into the chamber. He stares in wonder at \n               all the treasure. Then falls backwards into a pile of jewels \n               and rolls about.\n\n               INT. CEMETERY - DAY\n\n               Evelyn wakes up, lying chained to the top of the altar. She \n               blinks, then turns her head, -- and looks right into the \n               ROTTED FACE of Anck-su-namun's corpse. Evelyn SCREAMS.\n\n               INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAYS - DAY\n\n               The elephant gun FIRES, blasting FLAME and SMOKE right into \n               the LENS. O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray race down a \n               passageway, a dozen mummies striding after them.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         This whole place is comin, alive!\n\n               The men race around a corner. More mummies. They race around \n               another corner. More mummies. Onward they come. Methodical. \n               Relentless. Boxing in our heroes. O'Connell and Ardeth Ray \n               FIRING as they go. Ardeth Ray goes empty.\n\n                                     ARDETH RAY\n                         I'm out.\n\n               He throws the machine-gun down and they all race into --\n\n               HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY\n\n               -- A small chamber. The lower half of the giant statue of \n               HORUS stands in the middle of the chamber.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         There he is!\n\n               They run up to the base of the statue,\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Hello Horus old boy.\n\n               O'Connell looks back at the mummies coming down the \n               passageway. He reaches into his gunny-sack and pulls out a \n               stick of dynamite. Ardeth Ray taps him on the shoulder.\n\n                                     ARDETH RAY\n                         Allow me.\n\n               O'Connell hands him the dynamite and a match, then turns to \n               look at the statue. Ardeth Ray reaches forward and strikes \n               the match off O'Connell's stubbly face. O'Connell YELPS.\n\n               Ardeth Ray lights the dynamite and throws it down the \n               passageway. They all hit the deck. The dynamite EXPLODES.\n\n               Ripping apart the creatures, causing a CAVE-IN and sealing \n               the passageway with rock and dirt. Now there's only one way \n               out, -- another dark, creepy passageway.\n\n               INT. CEMETERY\n\n               Chained tight to the top of the altar, Evelyn hopelessly \n               struggles to free herself. She stops as Priest mummies start \n               surrounding the altar. Evelyn is horrified as the hideous \n               mummies kneel down and begin to CHANT, -- which now sounds \n               even more horrific due to the lack of tongues, jaws and mouths \n               in the room.\n\n               Imhotep steps up carrying the black Book Of The Dead. His \n               hand reaches out and lovingly caresses Anck-su-namun's decayed \n               cheek.\n\n               INT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY\n\n               O'Connell and Jonathan are digging away at the seams of the \n               secret compartment, it starts to give. And that's when Ardeth \n               Ray spots another group of rotting mummies coming down the \n               dark passageway, heading right for them. O'Connell looks up.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         These guys just don't quit.\n\n               Ardeth Ray grabs the elephant gun and a handful of shells \n               and runs off towards the mummies.\n\n                                     ARDETH RAY\n                         Keep digging!\n\n               O'Connell and Jonathan redouble their efforts, pulling harder \n               on the seam. The compartment starts to loosen. About to give.\n\n               The last time this happened, salt acid sprayed out, remember?\n\n               Our heroes keep tugging. The tension mounts...\n\n               And that's when a SKELETAL HAND BURSTS UP OUT OF THE GROUND \n               and grabs O'Connell's ankle. Several more moldy hands BURST \n               up out of the ground. O'Connell and Jonathan struggle with \n               the mummies as they crawl up out of the dirt floor.\n\n               One of the mummies violently shoves O'Connell away. Another \n               grabs Jonathan by the throat and starts to strangle him. A \n               third mummy grabs at the secret compartment and pulls hard.\n\n               AN INTENSE BURST OF ACID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM AND HITS ALL \n               THREE OF THE MUMMIES. The one strangling Jonathan gets it in \n               the back and drops him. All three mummies melt horribly.\n\n               INT. CEMETERY\n\n               Imhotep begins to read from The Book Of The Dead.\n\n               A large SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog.\n\n               Evelyn's eyes widen in amazement and horror.\n\n               INT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY\n\n               Ardeth Ray BLASTS AWAY at the oncoming mummies. over at the \n               base of the statue, O'Connell and Jonathan pull an ornate \n               chest out of the secret compartment. O'Connell rips off the \n               lid, reaches inside and pulls out a heavy burlap bag.\n\n               He and Jonathan exchange nervous, excited looks. Then he \n               reaches into the bag and slowly pulls out the SOLID GOLD \n               Book Of The Living -- GOLDEN LIGHT reflects off their faces \n               as they stare at it in wonder.\n\n               The elephant gun goes empty. Ardeth Ray takes it by the barrel \n               and wades into the remaining mummies swinging.\n\n                                     ARDETH RAY\n                         Save the girl! Kill the creature!\n\n               The mummies quickly overwhelm and start to tear him apart.\n\n               O'Connell lights the last stick of dynamite and throws it \n               against the far wall. He and Jonathan hit the deck.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         That's the last one, we better get \n                         lucky.\n\n               The wall BLOWS. Debris COLLAPSES, -- but now here's a hole \n               for them to get out. O'Connell and Jonathan race out through \n               the hole just as the remaining mummies enter the chamber.\n\n               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA RUINS - DAY\n\n               Outside, Beni staggers across the sand with a saddlebag filled \n               with treasure. He throws it over the rear of a camel.\n\n               Starts to climb up. Hesitates. Looks back at the temple door.\n\n               Licks his lips. And then his greed gets the better of him \n               and he quickly climbs down and scurries back towards the \n               door.\n\n               INT. CEMETERY - DAY\n\n               Imhotep READS from the Book. The rotten Priest-mummies rock \n               back and forth, CHANTING. Evelyn struggles.\n\n               Then suddenly, the strange MIST wafts up out of the swirling \n               hole and over to the sacred jars, it passes through them and \n               into Evelyn. Evelyn JERKS as though she's been electrified.\n\n               The MIST passes through her and into Anck-su-namun's body.\n\n               The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING HOLE, WAFTING MIST and \n               IMHOTEP'S READINGS reach a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's crusty \n               EYELIDS suddenly POP OPEN. Evelyn stares at her in disbelief.\n\n               Anck-su-namun's rotted head turns and looks at Evelyn with \n               empty sockets. Evelyn freaks out and struggles wildly, then \n               she notices Imhotep holding the ancient sacrificial knife.\n\n                                     IMHOTEP\n                         With your death, my love and I will \n                         be invincible!\n\n               He raises it up over Evelyn's chest, about to plunge it down.\n\n               Evelyn's eyes widen in horror. And that's when O'Connell and \n               Jonathan BURST IN. Imhotep spins around and faces them.\n\n               Jonathan beams as he holds up the golden Book Of The Living.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         I found it, Evy!

The MIST vanishes.\n\n               Imhotep steps forward. O'Connell STRIKES the sacrificial \n               knife out of his hand. Imhotep BELLOWS a command. The Priests \n               stand up, swords and knives in hand, they ATTACK O'Connell.\n\n               EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE, READ FASTER:\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Open the book, Jonathan!

That's the only way to kill \n                         him!\n\n               O'Connell RACKS and CHOPS at the attacking Priest-mummies, \n               fighting his way to Evelyn. The skeletal creatures wildly \n               SWING their swords, trying to STAB O'Connell. Jonathan fumbles \n               with the book, struggling to open it, -- he can't.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         I can't open it!

One chain breaks free.\n\n               Jonathan spots a series of SOLID GOLD, FOUR-SIDED LOCKS along \n               the binder. It hits him like lightning --\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         We need the key!\n\n               Imhotep grins, then grabs the KEY/BOX hanging from a chain \n               around his neck, rips it off and shoves it into his pocket \n               He picks up the sacrificial sword and heads for Jonathan.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         What do I do, Evy!?

Evelyn now \n               has one hand and one leg free. More mummies attack O'Connell \n               force him back.\n\n               Jonathan quickly starts translating the cover inscription, \n               but his ancient Egyptian is clearly awful.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Keetash-something, naraba-something.\n\n               Jonathan starts to backpedal through the cemetery, clutching \n               the golden book; wide-eyed, as Imhotep moves in on him.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Ebarra im hatu Kashka ummmmm -- ?\n\n               Jonathan trips and falls on his ass. Imhotep CHARGES FORWARD.\n\n               O'Connell SLASHES another chain. Only one more left holding \n               Evelyn. Jonathan sits up and quickly looks back at the cover.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Rasheem Aaaaa ANUBIS!\n\n               Imhotep raises the sacrificial sword, about to kill Jonathan.\n\n               And that's when the giant statue of Anubis suddenly CRASHES \n               through the wall -- shades of Ray Harryhausen. Only better.\n\n               The god of Deaths, horrible, decrepit STONE FACE stares \n               angrily down. Jonathan stares back.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Oh boy.\n\n               O'Connell DECAPITATES a mummy and looks up at Anubis.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         This just keeps gettin, better and \n                         better.\n\n               Imhotep leaves Jonathan and heads for the giant statue.\n\n               O'Connell leaps over and with one last swing of the sword, \n               frees Evelyn from her chains. More Priest-mummies attack, \n               forcing him away. Evelyn jumps off the altar and starts to \n               head for O'Connell, -- a SKELETAL HAND grabs her! Spins her \n               around. It's Anck-su-namun's rotted corpse. Evelyn reacts.\n\n               Imhotep looks up at Anubis, points to O'Connell, and in \n               ANCIENT EGYPTIAN commands him to attack. Anubis moves for \n               O'Connell, STOMPING over mausoleums and through the detritus \n               moat on his way. O'Connell quickly backs away.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         You have got to be joking?\n\n               Evelyn is backing away from Anck-su-namun.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Finish the inscription, idiot!\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Oh.\n\n               Anck-su-namun ATTACKS Evelyn. Evelyn fends her off as best \n               she can. Jonathan quickly looks back at the hieroglyphs on \n               the book cover, fumbling badly under the pressure --\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now \n                         what is this last symbol here?\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         What's it look like!?\n\n               Anck-su-namun grabs Evelyn by the throat. The statue of Anubis \n               corners O'Connell, reaches down and GRABS him with it's \n               MASSIVE TALONS. O'Connell HACKS away at it. Jonathan stares \n               at the inscription, slightly oblivious.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         It's an Anck symbol, with two little \n                         squiggly lines above it, and a bird, \n                         a stork! on either side.\n\n               Evelyn is being STRANGLED by Anck-su-namun.\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Yes,... I see.\n\n               The talons lift O'Connell up and start to CRUSH him.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Hootash im Ahmenophus!\n\n               The giant statue of Anubis instantly freezes in it's tracks \n               and PETRIFIES. It's off balance. Starts to fall. O'Connell \n               slides free of it's talons. Evelyn SHOVES Anck-su-namun away, \n               Anck-su-namun looks up and opens her fetid mouth to scream \n               just as Anubis CRASHES DOWN on top of her, SMASHING HER to \n               powder and DRIVING her into the ground.\n\n               Imhotep SHRIEKS in rage and horror, then turns and angrily \n               heads for Jonathan. Jonathan, sitting on his ass, quickly \n               backpedals on his hands and heels.\n\n               O'Connell leaps to his feet, sword in hand and runs for \n               Imhotep. Imhotep grabs Jonathan, lifts him up, rips the golden \n               Book Of The Living out of his hand and pins him to a wall.\n\n               O'Connell runs up and swings his sword at Imhotep, -- WAP!\n\n               SLICES Imhotep's right arm off. It drops to the ground, still \n               clutching The Book Of The Living. Imhotep drops Jonathan and \n               spins around, facing O'Connell. O'Connell grins.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Okay pal, let's see how tough you \n                         are without your right arm.\n\n               Imhotep grabs O'Connell with his left arm and THROWS him \n               half way across the cemetery. O'Connell SLAMS into a \n               gravestone, bounces off and crashes to the ground. He shakes \n               it off.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Alright,... so he's left handed.\n\n               Imhotep is already striding towards him. Jonathan lifts up \n               his hand, -- HE HAS THE KEY/BOX BACK! He smiles at Evelyn.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         I got it!\n\n               Evelyn runs for Jonathan.\n\n               O'Connell SWINGS his sword and CLEAVES a big chunk of molten \n               flesh rot out of Imhotep's stomach. On the outside, Imhotep \n               looks human, but on the inside he is still a rotten old mummy.\n\n               Imhotep BACKHANDS O'Connell. Knocks him twenty feet back.\n\n               O'Connell staggers to his feet. Imhotep is right there. CLUBS \n               him hard with his left arm. O'Connell spins through the air,\n\n               SLAMS into the side of a mausoleum. Imhotep approaches, rage \n               in his eyes. O'Connell gets up, quickly pivots and HACKS \n               into Imhotep's head. Imhotep grins and PUNCHES O'Connell in \n               the face. O'Connell is thrown back, pulling his sword with \n               him.\n\n               He bounces hard off the mausoleum. Lands on his feet.\n\n               Totally beat-to-shit. Knees buckling. He can barely stand.\n\n               Jonathan lifts up the heavy gold book, -- Imhotep's severed \n               hand still clings to it. Jonathan cringes in disgust. Evelyn \n               yanks it off, throws it away, then start furiously working \n               the key into the series of locks, unlocking each of them.\n\n               Imhotep strides forward. O'Connell backs into the mausoleum, \n               swings the sword, Imhotep tries to catch it, -- it CLEAVES \n               through his palm and deeply imbeds itself into his forearm.\n\n               No matter, Imhotep rips the sword away from O'Connell and \n               casually flings it away.\n\n               The golden Book Of The Living opens with a HISS. Jonathan \n               holds it tight as Evelyn quickly turns the heavy gold pages \n               looking for something.\n\n               O'Connell turns to run, but Imhotep grabs him by the throat \n               and lifts him off his feet. O'Connell hangs there, a dazed \n               mess. Imhotep grins, says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, \n               then starts to strangle O'Connell. O'Connell chokes. About \n               to die.\n\n               Evelyn turns and faces Imhotep and reads an inscription:\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Kadeesh mal! Kadeesh mal! Pared oos! \n                         PARED OOS!!\n\n               Imhotep pivots and looks at Evelyn, a look of sheer terror \n               on his face. Then he looks over at the detritus bog. Which \n               starts to BUBBLE and SHIFT. The SWIRLING HOLE begins to open.\n\n               And then suddenly THE SPIRITS OF THE EGYPTIAN GODS waft out \n               of the black bog and SWIRL around the Priest-mummies. The \n               mummies all collapse and turn to dust. And then the spirits \n               attack Imhotep. Lifting him and O'Connell up into the air.\n\n               Imhotep lets go of O'Connell, who falls to the ground.\n\n               Evelyn and Jonathan fearfully stumble away from the spirits, \n               Jonathan trips and falls and accidentally throws The Book of \n               The Living into the detritus bog. Evelyn watches as the golden \n               book sinks into the black putrescence. Jonathan looks like \n               he's about to cry.\n\n               Ten feet off the ground, the spirits SWIRL around Imhotep's \n               body, TWISTING IT and TURNING IT and slowly SHRIVELING IT.\n\n               Accompanied by the same strange FLASHING LIGHT we saw at the \n               beginning of the movie when Anck-su-namun was cursed. One \n               last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and Imhotep \n               is spit out and thrown to the floor. He staggers to his feet, \n               he looks perfectly normal. His body is completely intact.\n\n               O'Connell swings his sword. Imhotep jerks back. The sword \n               scrapes Imhotep's chest, -- a swath of blood appears across \n               Imhotep's chest where the sword hit him. Imhotep touches the \n               blood on his chest, amazed and horrified. He's mortal.\n\n               O'Connell runs Imhotep through with the sword and shoves him \n               backwards. Imhotep stumbles back and falls into the detritus \n               bog. The sword still in his stomach.\n\n               Evelyn and Jonathan run up next to O'Connell. They watch as \n               Imhotep gently sinks into the fetid swamp, slowly dying. And \n               then, just before his head goes under, Imhotep looks up at \n               them, grins broadly, and says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.\n\n               Evelyn translates:\n\n                                     EVELYN\n                         Death is only the beginning.\n\n               Imhotep's grinning face vanishes under the black bile.\n\n               STAFF CHAMBER - DAY\n\n               Beni staggers across a chamber, straining under the weight \n               of another saddlebag filled with treasure. He spots a large, \n               ornate STAFF sticking out of a wall. He throws the saddlebag \n               over the staff and collapses against the wall. Exhausted.\n\n               A BEAT. And then the weight of the treasure PULLS THE STAFF \n               DOWN. Which starts a massive AURAL CHAIN-REACTION.\n\n               Beni-backs away from the wall, wide-eyed, filled with fear.\n\n               ALL THE WALLS START TO SINK INTO THE GROUND. Driven by tons \n               of pouring sand. Beni turns and hauls ass out of the chamber.\n\n               CEMETERY - DAY\n\n               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan look around as all the walls \n               start to DESCEND. O'Connell grabs Evelyn's hand.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         C'mon!\n\n               He pulls her forward and all three of them race past sinking \n               pillars. They duck as they run into a descending doorway.\n\n               INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY\n\n               Beni scampers down a passageway, the ceiling getting lower \n               and lower until he has to crouch. And then he has to stick \n               the TORCH between his teeth and crawl on his hands and knees.\n\n               INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY\n\n               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch-run into the treasure \n               chamber. Evelyn skids to a stop. Looks in wonder at all the \n               treasure. SAND rains down on them. O'Connell grabs her again \n               and quickly pulls her through the mounds of treasure towards \n               a SINKING DOORWAY on the far side of the room. The SOUND of \n               the sinking walls is deafening.\n\n               Beni crouch-runs into the treasure chamber. O'Connell, Evelyn \n               and Jonathan race past him. He joins them as they run up a \n               staircase. Heading for a DESCENDING DOORWAY, which is already \n               half gone, it's now only four feet high -- now three feet \n               high -- now two feet. Jonathan dives through the narrow gap.\n\n               Then O'Connell dives through, he spins around. Evelyn dives, \n               but gets stuck in the middle, about to get cut in half.\n\n               O'Connell grabs her arm and YANKS her through in the nick of \n               time. Beni reaches through the narrowing gap with his hand --\n\n                                     BENI\n                         O'CONNELL!!\n\n               O'Connell grabs it, but it's too late. Beni yanks his hand \n               back just as the top of the door CRASHES to the floor.\n\n               Sealing him in. Beni quickly crawls back down the stairs as \n               the ceiling SLAMS down behind him. He stands up and looks \n               around with his diminishing torch.\n\n               All the doorways FINISH CLOSING. There's no way out. He's \n               trapped. And then he hears something, and turns around. Over \n               in the corner, a scarab-beetle stares at him, CHITTERING.\n\n               Beni waves his flickering torch at the scarab and backs away.\n\n                                     BENI\n                         Go away.\n\n               He stands in the middle of the treasure chamber as dozens \n               upon dozens of scarabs boil up out of the floor around him.\n\n               Beni is absolutely terrified. The scarabs start to move in.\n\n               And that's when Beni's torch goes out. PITCH BLACK. A BEAT.\n\n               And then we hear Beni start SCREAMING in horror and pain.\n\n               And the scarabs CHITTERING hungrily.\n\n               EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY\n\n               The temple COLLAPSES as O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and a \n               pack of stray camels race through the ruins. A SINKING CREVICE \n               DROPS OUT right behind them. Chasing them out through the \n               front gates. The whole place RUMBLES ominously.\n\n               They make it down the ramp as more ruins CRASH DOWN behind \n               them. A MASSIVE CLOUD OF SAND AND DUST billows out over the \n               wall and into the air. our heroes and all the stray camels \n               race out into the desert...\n\n                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. PLATEAU - DAY\n\n               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan stand in the middle of the \n               plateau, surrounded by stray camels. They stare off at the \n               sandy, dusty, volcano as it continues to RUMBLE-ominously.\n\n                                     JONATHAN\n                         Well,... I guess we go home empty \n                         handed.\n\n               O'Connell looks at Evelyn.\n\n                                     O'CONNELL\n                         Wouldn't say that.\n\n               Evelyn returns the look, A BEAT, and then she wraps-her arms \n               around his neck and kisses him. O'Connell returns it.\n\n               Jonathan just rolls his eyes, snorts in disgust and climbs \n               up onto a camel.\n\n               When the kiss is over, O'Connell and Evelyn share a smile, \n               then O'Connell leaps up into the saddle, reaches down, grabs \n               Evelyn's hand and pulls her up behind him.
