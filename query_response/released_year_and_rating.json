CITY STREET - DAY\n\n        Downtown L.A.  Noon on a hot summer day.  On an EXTREME LONG LENS the\n        lunchtime crowd stacks up into a wall of humanity.  In SLOW MOTION\n        they move in herds among the glittering rows of cars jammed bumper to\n        bumper.  Heat ripples distort the torrent of faces.  The image is\n        surreal, dreamy... and like a dream it begins very slowly to\n\n                                                DISSOLVE TO:\n\n2       EXT. CITY RUINS - NIGHT\n\n        Same spot as the last shot, but now it is a landscape in Hell.  The\n        cars are stopped in rusted rows, still bumper to bumper.  The\n        skyline of buildings beyond has been shattered by some\n        unimaginable force like a row of kicked-down sandcastles.\n        Wind blows through the desolation, keening with the sound of ten\n        million dead souls.  It scurries the ashes into drifts, stark\n        white in the moonlight against the charred rubble.\n        A TITLE CARD FADES IN:\n\n                        LOS ANGELES, July 11, 2029\n\n3       ANGLE ON a heap of fire-blackened human bones.  Beyond the mound is a\n        vast tundra of skulls and shattered concrete.  The rush hour crowd\n        burned down in their tracks.\n\n4       WE DISSOLVE TO a playground... where intense heat has half-melted the\n        jungle gym, the blast has warped the swing set, the merry-go-round\n        has sagged in the firestorm.  Small skulls look accusingly from the\n        ash-drifts.  WE HEAR the distant echo of children's voices... playing\n        and laughing in the sun.  A silly, sing-songy rhyme as WE TRACKS\n        SLOWLY over seared asphalt where the faint hieroglyphs of hopscotch\n        lines are still visible.\n\n        CAMERA comes to rest on a burnt and rusted tricycle... next to the\n        tiny skull of its owner.  HOLD ON THIS IMAGE as a female VOICE speaks:\n\n                                VOICE\n                3 billion human lives ended on August 29th, 1997.\n                The survivors of the nuclear fire called the war\n                Judgment Day.  They lived only to face a new\n                nightmare, the war against the Machines...\n\n        A metal foot crushes the skull like china.\n\n        TILT UP, revealing a humanoid machine holding a massive battle rifle.\n        It looks like a CHROME SKELETON... a high-tech Death figure.  It is\n        the endoskeleton of a Series 800 terminator.  Its glowing red eyes\n        compassionlessly sweep the dead terrain, hunting.\n\n        The SOUNDS of ROARING TURBINES.  Searchlights blaze down as a\n        formation of flying HK (Hunter-Killer) patrol machines passes\n        overhead.  PAN WITH THEM toward the jagged horizon, beyond which we\n        see flashes, and hear the distant thunder of a pitched battle in\n        progress.\n\n5       EXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT\n\n        THE BATTLE.  Human troops is desperate combat with the machines for\n        possession of the dead Earth.  The humans are a ragtag guerrilla\n        army.  Skynet's weapons consist of Ground HKs (tank-like robot\n        gun-platforms), flying Aerial HKs, four-legged gun-pods called\n        Centurions, and the humanoid terminators in various forms.\n\n        SEQUENCE OF RAPID CUTS:\n5A      Explosions!  Beam-weapons firing like searing strobe-light.\n5B      A gunner is an armored personnel carrier fires a LAW rocket at a\n        pursuing Aerial HK, bringing it down in a fiery explosion.\n5C      Another APC is crushed under the treads of a massive Ground HK.\n\n5D      A TEAM OF GUERRILLAS in a intense fire-fight with terminator\n5E      endoskeletons in the ruins of a building.  Three terminator\n5F      endoskeletons advance, firing rapidly.  Another (complete cyborg),\n        with flesh ripped open and back broken, gropes for a rifle on the\n        ground.\n\n5G      A Centurion overruns a human firing position.  Soldiers are cut\n        down as they run.  Fiery explosions light the ranks of advancing\n        machines.\n\n6       IN A BLASTED GUN EMPLACEMENT at the edge of battle, a man watches\n        the combat with night-vision binoculars.  He wears the uniform of a\n        guerrilla general, and a black beret.  He is still amid running,\n        shouting techs and officers.\n\n        C.U. MAN, pushing slowly in as the battle rages O.S.  He lowers the\n        binoculars.  He is forty-five years old.  Features severe.  The left\n        side of his face is heavily scarred.  A patch covers that eye.  An\n        impressive man, forged in the furnace of a lifetime of war.  The name\n        stitched on the band of his beret is CONNOR.  We push in until his\n        eyes fill frame, then...\n\n                                                DISSOLVE TO:\n\n        FIRE.  SLOW, BOILING, ENORMOUS.  FILLING FRAME.\n\n                                VOICE (SARAH CONNOR)\n                Skynet, the computer which controlled the machines,\n                sent two terminators back through time.  Their\n                mission: to destroy the leader of the human\n                Resistance... John Connor.  My son.\n\n                The first terminator was programmed to strike at\n                me, in the year 1984... before John was born.\n                It failed.\n\n                The second was set to strike at John himself,\n                when he was still a child.  As before, the\n                Resistance was able to send a lone warrior.  A\n                protector for John.  It was just a question of\n                which one of them would reach him first...\n\n                                                DISSOLVE TO:\n\n7       EXT. TRUCKSTOP - NIGHT\n\n        Wild fingers of BLUE-WHITE ELECTRIC ARCS dance in a steel canyon\n        formed by two TRACTOR TRAILERS, parked side by side in the back lot\n        of an all-night truck stop.  Then...\n\n        The strange lightning forms a circular opening in mid-air, and in\n        the sudden flare of light we see a FIGURE in a SPHERE OF ENERGY.\n        Then the FRAME WHITES OUT with an explosive THUNDERCLAP!\n\n        Through the clearing vapor we see the figure clearly... a naked man.\n        TERMINATOR has come through.  Physique: massive, perfect.  Face:\n        devoid of emotion.  Terminator stands and impassively surveys its\n        surroundings.\n\n8       INT. TRUCK STOP DINER - NIGHT\n\n        On a back route to north L.A.  A handful of local TRUCKERS hunch over\n        chili-sizes, CAT hats pushed back on their heads.  Three BIKERS are\n        playing a game of pool in the back, their Miller empties lining the\n        table's rail.  The dive's owner, LLOYD, a fat, aging biker-type in a\n        soiled apron, stands behind the bar.  Nothing much going on...\n\n        Then the front door opens and a big naked guy strolls in -- that\n        doesn't happen every night.  All eyes simultaneously swivel toward\n        Terminator.  Its emotionless gaze passes over the customers as it\n        walks calmly through the room.  Everyone frozen, not sure how to\n        react.\n\n8A      TERMINATOR POV.  A digitized electronic scan of the room, overlaid\n        with alphanumeric readouts which change faster than the human eye\n        can follow.  In POV we move past the staring truckers, past the\n        owner and the awestruck WAITRESS, and approach a large nasty-looking\n        biker puffing on a cigar.  His body is outlined, or \"selected\", and\n        thousands of estimated measurements appear.  His clothing has been\n        analyzed and deemed suitable...\n\n8B                              TERMINATOR\n                I need your clothes, your boots, and your\n                motorcycle.\n\n        The big biker's eyes narrow.  He takes a long draw on this cigar,\n        the tip cherry-red hot.\n\n                                CIGAR BIKER\n                You forgot to say please.\n\n        He grinds the cigar out on Terminator's chest.  Which produces not\n        the slight reaction of pain.  Terminator calmly, and without\n        expression, grabs Cigar by his meaty upper arm...\n        Cigar screams from the hydraulic grip.\n\n        Terminator doesn't see Cigar's friend, behind him, holding his pool\n        cue by the narrow end like a Louisville Slugger.  The heavy send\n        whistles in a powerful swing and CRACKS IN TWO across the back of\n        Terminator's head.\n\n        Terminator seems not to notice.  Doesn't even blink.  Without\n        releasing his grip on Cigar, he snaps his arm straight back and grabs\n        Pool Cue by the front of his jacket.  Suddenly the heavyset biker\n        finds himself flying through the nearest window.  CRAASSH!\n\n        Terminator hurls Cigar, all 230 pounds of him, clear over the bar,\n        through the serving window into the kitchen, where he lands on the\n        big flat GRILL.  We hear a SOUND like SIZZLING BACON as Cigar\n        screams, flopping jerking.  He rolls off in a smoking heap.\n\n        The third biker whips out a knife with a eight-inch blade and slashes\n        at Terminator's face.\n\n        Terminator grabs the arcing blade with his bare hand.  Holding it by\n        the razor-sharp blade he jerks is from the guy's hand.\n        Ultra-fast here: He flips it.  Grabs the handle like you're supposed\n        to hold a knife.  Grabs the biker and slams him face-down over the\n        bar.  Then brings the knife whistling down, pinning the biker's\n        shoulder to the bar top with his own steel.\n\n9       INT. KITCHEN\n\n        The doors BANGS OPEN and Terminator strides in.\n        The Mexican cook does a fast fade as Terminator walks toward Cigar,\n        who is cursing in pain on the floor.\n\n        With his deep-fried fingers he struggles to get out the .45 auto\n        tucked under his leather jacket.  But he can't even hold onto it.\n        Terminator takes it from him.  Instead of pointing it at him,\n        Terminator carefully examines weapon, analyzing its caliber and\n        operating condition.  Terminator never threatens... that's a human\n        thing.  He just takes.\n\n        Cigar senses what he must do when the emotionless eyes come back to\n        him.  He slides the keys to his bike across the floor to Terminator's\n        foot.  Then painfully starts getting out of his jacket.\n\n10      INT. TRUCK STOP\n\n        Terminator strides from the kitchen, fully clothed now in a black\n        leather jacket, leather riding pants, and heavy, clean boots.  He\n        moves toward the moaning biker pinned to the pool table.  Without\n        slowing his stride he jerks the knife out.  The guy slumps to the\n        floor, groaning, behind him.\n\n        Terminator continues toward the front of the diner, passing Lloyd,\n        the owner.  At the door, he comes abreast of two truckers who sit\n        frozen like a snapshot in mid-bite.  One of the truckers finally\n        nods.\n\n                                TRUCKER\n                Evening...\n\n        Terminator impassively stares back.  Then moves on out the door.\n\n11      EXT. TRUCK STOP\n\n        Terminator walks out, surveying the parked Harleys.  Sticks the .45\n        in his belt and swings one leg over a massive CUSTOM ELECTRO-GLIDE.\n        He slips the dagger in his boot and the key in the ignition.  Kicks\n        over the engine.  It catches with a roar and he slams the heavy iron\n        into gear with a KLUNK.\n\n        Lloyd appears at the diner's door with a sawed-off 10-GAUGE\n        WINCHESTER LEVER-ACTION SHOTGUN.  He fires into the air and jacks\n        around round in fast, aiming at Terminator's back.\n\n                                LLOYD\n                I can't let you take the man's wheels, son.\n                Now get off or I'll put you down.\n\n        Terminator turns and considers by coldly.  He eases the shifter up\n        into neutral.  Rocks the bike onto its kickstand.  Swings him leg\n        over and walks calmly toward the guy.\n\n        Terminator strides right up to Lloyd, staring straight into the\n        shotgun's muzzle.  Lloyd starts sweating, trying to decide is he's\n        going to kill a man in cold blood.  He's still trying to decide when\n        Terminator's hand blurs out like a striking cobra and is somehow\n        suddenly holding the shotgun.\n\n        Lloyd gapes, knowing he's screwed.  Then...\n        Terminator reaches toward him.  Oh shit...\n        And slips the sunglasses out of Lloyd's shirt pocket.  Puts them on.\n        Strides back to the Harley and roars off in a shower of gravel.\n\n12      EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT\n\n        Terminator roars down the freeway, heading for L.A.  Cold neon flares\n        across the chrome of the big bike.  The 10-gauge is jammed through\n        the clutch and brake cables, across the handlebars.  The lights flow\n        over Terminator's wrap-around sunglasses like the tracks of tracer\n        rounds.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n13      EXT. OVERPASS - NIGHT\n\n        The First Street Bridge.  Rusting chain-link fence and graffiti-\n        covered walls.  An L.A.P.D. BLACK-AND-WHITE cruises the empty street.\n\n        A TREMENDOUS BLUE-WHITE GLARE suddenly spills out between the columns\n        of the overpass.  The young UNIFORMED COP in the car whips his head\n        around at the source of the light.  He pulls over quickly, in time\n        to see...\n\n13A     The powerfully arcing electrical discharge reaches its peak between\n        the columns.  Lightning climbs the chain-link fence and light\n        standards, lighting up the night, and papers swirl in a blasting\n        whirlwind.\n\n13B     The cop climbs from his cruiser as the glow fades.\n        He sees vapor dissipating as he approaches the spot where he saw the\n        strange light.  He draws his revolver and cautiously moves into the\n        shadows between the rows of pillars.\n\n        A NAKED MAN glides from a shadowed doorway behind the cop.  Nothing\n        special about him.  Certainly not built like a terminator.  The flash\n        of light and fact that he is naked are pretty good clues that he\n        just arrived from the future.  His features are handsome bordering\n        on severe.  His eyes are gray ice.  Penetrating.  Intelligent.\n\n        THE COP spins at a sound.  Too late.  Mr. X is already on him.  The\n        blow is lighting fast and the cop drops like a bag of sand.\n\n        LOW ANGLE as the unconscious cop hits the deck, his BERETTA 9mm\n        AUTOMATIC clattering next to him.  A hand ENTERS FRAME and picks up\n        this pistol.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n13C     HIGHLY POLISHED BLACK SHOES rounding the rear tire of the police\n        cruiser.  FOLLOW THE SHOES to the cruiser's door then MOVE UP as\n        Mr. X, dressed now in LAPD blue, climbs behind the wheel.  He\n        looks and acts exactly like a cop.  Cool, alert, confident in his\n        power, his expression emotionless and judgmental.\n        Mr. X, now Officer X, puts the car in gear and drives into the night.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n14      INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE/GARAGE - DAY\n\n        TIGHT ON YOUNG JOHN CONNOR, who at his moment is ten years old and\n        busy reassembling the carburetor on his Honda 125 dirtbike.  He has\n        ripped Levi's and long stringy hair.  A sullen mouth.  Eyes which\n        reveal an intelligence as sharp as a scalpel.  The Ramones' \"I Wanna\n        Be Sedated\" blasts from a boom box next to him.\n\n        A WOMAN, JANELLA VOIGHT, stands in the doorway of the garage,\n        yelling over the music.\n\n                                WOMAN\n                ...John?

HOUSE - LIVING ROOM\n\n        Janelle storms into the room.  TOD VOIGHT, her husband, watches\n        sports on the TV.  They're both in their thirties.  Middle-class\n        working stiffs.\n\n                                JANELLE\n                I swear I've had it with that goddamn kid.\n                He won't even answer me.\n                        (neither does he)\n                Todd?  Are you gonna sit there or are you gonna\n                do something?\n\n        He sighs.  Throws down the TV's remote and heads for the garage.\n\n16      INT. GARAGE\n\n        John hops on the bike.  Kick-starts it.  Tim picks up John's nylon\n        bag, then climbs on the back.  Todd ENTERS and shouts over the\n        engine, which John revs louder and louder.\n\n                                TODD\n                John!  Get your ass inside right now and do\n                what your mother says!\n\n        John pins Todd with a defiant glare.\n\n                                JOHN\n                She's not my mother, Todd!\n\n        He revs the engine and peels out of the garage, with Tim almost\n        falling off the back.  They take off down the street.\n\n17      EXT. VACANT LOT/DRAINAGE CANAL\n\n        John cuts through a vacant lot to a trail running beside a fenced-in\n        drainage canal.  He guns the bike through a hole in the retaining\n        fence.  Tim's eyes go wide as they roar down the concrete embankment.\n\n17A     IN THE DRAINAGE CANAL John zig-zags along, throwing up a\n        roostertail of muddy water.  Tim shouts, pretending he didn't just\n        see his life flash before his eyes.  He slaps John on the back.\n\n                                TIM\n                Major moves, homes!  So... where is your\n                real mom, anyway?\n                        (John doesn't answer)\n                She dead or something?\n\n        It's hard to read John's expression.\n\n                                JOHN\n                She might as well be.\n\n        John twists the throttle angrily and the bike lunges forward.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n18      EXT. PESCADERO STATE HOSPITAL - DAY\n\n        A SIGN on a chain link fence topped with concertina wire reads:\n        PESCADERO STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE.  Beyond it\n        squats an imposing four-story building.  Institutional brick.\n        Barred windows.  About as inviting as KGB headquarters.  Security\n        guards patrol the manicured grass.\n\n19      INT. HOSPITAL - MAXIMUM SECURITY WING\n\n        Sunlight is a barred slash on the bare institutional wall.  The room\n        is empty of all furnishings save the bed, a stainless steel sink,\n        toilet, and a dented metal mirror.  WE HEAR a rhythmic grunting,\n        small explosions of breath in perfectly-metered time.\n\n        PAN TO a bedframe leaned upright against the wall, legs facing\n        outward.  A pair of sweaty hands grip one leg.  Tendons knot and\n        release as SOMEONE does pull-ups.  A man of tangled hair hides the\n        face that comes INTO FRAME, dips out, comes back.\n\n        WIDER.  A WOMAN in a tank top and hospital pants in hanging from the\n        top leg of the vertical bedframe.  Her body is straight and taut.\n        Knees bent so the feet clear the ground.  The arms are lean and\n        muscular.  The inmate, face hidden, pulls up, dips, pulls up.  Like\n        a machine.  No change in rhythm.\n\n20      INT. HOSPITAL/CORRIDOR\n\n        FIGURES MOVE TOWARD US down a corridor of polished tile and two-\n        tone walls.  DR. PETER SILBERMAN, a smug criminal psychologist,\n        leads a group of young INTERNS.  Following laconically, are THREE\n        BURLY ATTENDANTS.\n\n                                SILBERMAN\n                The next patient is a 29-year old female\n                diagnosed as acute schizo-affective disorder.\n                The usual indicators... depression, anxiety,\n                violent acting-out, delusions of persecution.\n                        (the interns nod judiciously)\n                Here we are.\n\n        Silberman stops at one of the SOUNDPROOF STEEL DOORS.  There is a two-\n        way speaker beneath a tiny window.  Silberman flips the intercom\n        switch.\n\n21      INT. CELL\n\n        Silberman's scrubbed and cheerful face at cell window.  HIS VOICE\n        comes over the tinny speaker.\n\n                                SILBERMAN\n                'Morning, Sarah.\n\n        REVERSE ANGLE as she turns slowly into CLOSE UP.\n        SARAH CONNOR is not the same woman we remember from last time.  Her\n        eyes peer out through a wild tangle of hair like those of a cornered\n        animal.  Defiant and intense, but skittering around looking for\n        escape at the same time.  Fight or flight.  Down one cheek is a long\n        scar, from just below the eye to her upper lip.\n        Her VOICE is a low and chilling monotone.\n\n                                SARAH\n                Good morning, Dr. Silberman.

Then returns.\n\n                                SILBERMAN\n                Fine, Sarah.\n                        (he switches off, speaks to\n                        the interns)\n                She, uh... stabbed me in the kneecap with a\n                screwdriver a few weeks ago.\n\n        Sarah watches them talking about her through the glass, but can't\n        hear them.  She feels like a lab animal.  The interns look in at her\n        through the glass as Silberman talks.  With her face drawn, eyes\n        haggard and hair wild, she looks like she belongs where she is.\n\n                                SILBERMAN\n                The delusional architecture is interesting.\n                She believes a machine called a \"terminator\",\n                which looks human of course, was sent back\n                though time to kill her.

See that she\n                takes her thorazine, would you?\n\n        DOUGLAS is 6'4\", 250 pounds and warm-hearted at a rattlesnake.  He\n        nods, catching Silberman's meaning, and gestures for the other\n        attendants to hang back as Silberman moves on in his rounds.\n\n23      INT. CELL\n\n        Sarah looks up as the cell door opens.  Douglas walks in slowly,\n        idly tapping his POLICE BATON against the door in a ominous rhythm.\n        The other two orderlies ease in behind him.  One of them carries a\n        STUN BATON (like a sawed-off cattle prod).  The other has a tray with\n        cups of red liquid-thorazine.\n\n                                DOUGLAS\n                Time to take you meds, Connor.\n\n        Sarah faces him, weight centered.

Takes her square in the stomach.  She doubles over and drops\n        to her knees, unable to breathe.  Douglas tips the bed and it slams\n        down with a crash, right new to her.  He takes her stun wand from\n        the other attendant and walks forward.\n\n        TIGHT ON SARAH, grimacing and struggling to breathe.\n\n                                SARAH\n                You... son of a...

Little\n        ELECTRIC ARCS CRACKLE as the baton makes her writhe in pain.\n        Douglas grabs her by the hair and jerks her up to her knees.  Holds\n        the cup of thorazine in front of her lips.\n\n                                DOUGLAS\n                Last call, sugar.\n\n        Gasping, she chokes the zombie juice down.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n24      EXT. BANK PARKING LOT - DAY\n\n        John furtively hunches before a Ready-Teller machine at the rear of\n        a local bank while his friend Tim stands lookout.  John slips a\n        stolen ATM card into the machine slot.  It is something he's rigged\n        up, because trailing from the card is ribbon-wire which goes to\n        some kind of black-box electronics unit he's got in his ever-present\n        knapsack.  He holds the pack between his knees and pulls out a\n        little lap-top keyboard, which is also connected to the black-box.\n\n        John enters a few commands and the plasma-screen displays the PIN\n        number for that account.  He quickly enters the number on the Ready-\n        Teller's keypad and asks it for 300 bucks.  The machine whirs then\n        begins dispensing twenty-dollar bills.  Tim looks back over his\n        shoulder amazed.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Easy money!\n\n                                TIM\n                Where'd you learn all this stuff?\n\n        John collects the twenties as the machine kicks them out.

When John\n        opens his wallet to put in his money, Tim notices a picture in a\n        plastic sleeve.\n\n                                TIM\n                That her?\n\n        John reluctantly shows his friend the Polaroid.  It is a shot of\n        Sarah.  Pregnant, in a jeep near the Mexican border.  John doesn't\n        know it now, but he will carry the photo with him for over 30 years,\n        and give it to a young man named Kyle Reese, who will travel back in\n        time to become his father.  Yes, that photo.\n\n                                TIM\n                So she's pretty cool, huh?\n\n                                JOHN\n                Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's\n                why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up\n                a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.\n\n                                TIM\n                No shit?\n\n                                JOHN\n                Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check\n                out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?\n\n        John has tried to sound casual, but we see in his eyes that is really\n        hurts.  He slaps Tim on the shoulder and they jump onto his Honda.\n        John fires up and they whine off down the alley.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n26      INT.

Reese is already, impossibly, a\n        hundred feet away, striding down the dim corridor.  A silhouette\n        in a long coat, disappearing around a corner.\n\n        Sarah runs after him, her bare feet slapping the cold linoleum.\n        Her hospital gown floats out behind her as she dream-runs along the\n        seemingly infinite corridor.  She reaches the corner, slides around\n        it, and...\n\n30A     Slams right into the arms of Douglas and his three helpers.  They\n        grab her as she struggles and screams.  The Silberman is there,\n        smiling soothingly.  They force her down and she is pinned to\n        the floor, screaming.  A new figure approaches... one even more\n        menacing.\n\n        TERMINATOR walks toward her, with heavy measured steps.  Backlit,\n        eyes concealed by the sunglasses, it stands over her like the angel\n        of death itself.  It reaches down and...\n        Takes her hand.  Lifts her up.  Leads her to a door.  They go through\n        together.  Emerging into...\n\n30B     A BEAUTIFUL SUNLIGHT MORNING.  CHILDREN are playing nearby... sliding\n        down slides, clambering through a jungle gym.  Sarah knows this\n        dream know... it's is the worst of all her nightmares.  She starts\n        to scream but no sound comes out.\n\n30C     THE SKY EXPLODES into WHITE LIGHT.  Everything is seared by the unholy\n        glare, hotter than a thousand suns.  The children ignite like\n        match heads.  Sarah is burning, screaming silently, everything silent\n        and overexposed.  Terminator's flesh and clothing are burning,\n        silently.  It grips her hand, Virgil to her Dante in this tour of the\n        nuclear-age Inferno.\n\n30D     THE BLAST WAVE HITS... a near-solid wall of compressed air followed\n        by 250-mph winds.  The children, charcoal statues frozen in positions\n        of play, explode into black leaves of ash and swirl away.  SOUND\n        hit now, with a thunderous roar.  Sarah's scream merges with the\n        howl of the wind as the blast hits her, exploding the flesh from her\n        bones.  Beside her, Terminator is stripped of its burnt flesh,\n        becoming a smoking skeleton of steel.\n\n30E     Then she wake up... in her cell, shackled to the bed.  Sunlight hurts\n        her eyes.  She looks desperate and defeated.  She knows the war is\n        coming.  It visits her every time she closes her eyes.  Lost and\n        alone, Sarah feels all hope recede for herself and for humanity.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n31      INT.

In the\n        shadows of the observation room we see that interns from the\n        earlier rounds, and a couple of STAFF PSYCHOLOGISTS.

The star of the Special\n        Projects Division.  He's brilliant, aggressive, driven.  Dyson walks\n        down the corridor, swinging his arms... a man in a hurry.  A man\n        with much to do.\n\n        He reaches a solid security door and zips his ELECTRONIC KEY-CARD\n        through the scanner.

Not a lab coat in sight.\n        This is strictly jeans and sneakers crowd.  All young and bright.\n        They sit at their consoles drinking Coke and changing technology as\n        we know it.

Dyson and a GUARD stand together before\n        what looks like a high-tech bank vault.  It requires two keys to\n        open, like the launch controls in a nuclear silo.  The guard and\n        Dyson insert their keys and turn them simultaneously.  Dyson then\n        enters a passcode at a console and the vault unlocks itself with a\n        sequence of clunks.  The door swings open and Dyson enters.  Bryant\n        stays outside with the guard, who notes Dyson's name and item on a\n        clipboard.\n\n37      INT. VAULT\n\n        Dyson walks to a stainless steel cabinet and opens it.  Inside is a\n        small artifact in a sealed container of inert gas.  IT -- a ceramic\n        rectangle, about the size of a domino, the color of liver.  It has\n        been shattered, painstakingly reconstructed and mounted on a metal\n        frame.\n\n        Dyson removes the artifact, it its insert-gas, and sets it on a\n        specially-designed cart.  He handles it like the Turin Shroud.\n        Dyson closes the cabinet.  Turns to the one next to it.  Opens its\n        door.  In this cabinet is a larger object... an intricate METAL HAND\n        AND FOREARM.\n\n        At the elbow, the metal is twisted and crushed.  But the forearm and\n        hand are intact.  Its metal surface scorched and discolored, it\n        stands upright in a vacuum flask, as if saluting.  This is all that\n        remains of the terminator Sarah destroyed.  Dyson stares at it, lost\n        in thought.  The he closes the cabinet, BLACKING OUT FRAME.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n38      INT.

He slouches\n        away from the game, looking for another.  Bored.\n\n        RACK FOCUS to Officer X passing the entrance of the store behind him.\n        The cop moves on, down the concourse, out of sight.\n        John gets in an \"Afterburner\" simulator game.\n\n43B     ON TERMINATOR, walking through the crowd in slow motion.  Scanning.\n        He moves with methodical purpose, knowing the target is close.  We\n        see that he is, incredibly, carrying a box of LONG-STEM ROSES.  Like\n        some hopeful guy with a hot date.\n\n43C     THE COP is pointed toward the arcade by come kids hanging out at the\n        multi-cinema.  He walks into the maze of kids engaged in synthesized\n        combat.  Cheap electronic effects blare above the crowd noise.\n\n43D     JOHN is shooting down MiGs at Mach 2.  His friend Tim slides up next\n        to him.  Taps him on the shoulder, trying to play it cool.\n\n                                TIM\n                Some cop is scoping for you, dude.\n\n        John looks around the corner of the \"Afterburner\" ride.  Sees the cop\n        showing a picture to some of the kids.  The kids point his way.\n\n        John ducks just as the cop glances over.  He slinks out the other side\n        of the ride and heads for the back of the store, instinctively\n        retreating.  Sarah has taught him that cops are bad news.\n\n        THE COP scans the crowded arcade.  Glimpses John, looking back as he\n        moves around a row of machines.  Starts toward him.\n\n        JOHN sees the cop homing in and starts walking fast.  Looks back.\n        THE COP is shoving through clots of kids.  One of them is slammed to\n        the floor.  As eddy of outrage behind the cop as he gains speed.\n        John breaks into run.  So does the cop.\n        Kids scatter like ten-pins as the cop charges after John.\n        John sprints through the arcade's back officer and store-rooms.\n\n44      INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR\n\n        John emerges through a firedoor into a long corridor with connects\n        to the parking garage.  He's running full out, when around the corner\n        ahead of him comes...\n\n        TERMINATOR.  Time stretches to nightmarish crawl as John tries to\n        brake to a stop.  Terminator reaches into the box of roses.\n\n        SLOW MOTION.  The cold back steel of the SHOTGUN emerges at the box\n        falls open, the roses spilling to the floor.  TERMINATOR'S BOOT\n        crushes the flowers as it moves forward.\n\n        JOHN, transfixed by terror, is trapped in the narrow featureless\n        shooting gallery of the corridor.  THE SHOTGUN COMES UP.  Terminator\n        expressionlessly strides forward.  Jacks a round into the chamber,\n        slow and fluid.\n\n        John looks behind him for a place to run.  Sees the cop coming toward\n        him, pulling his Beretta pistol.  Incredibly, John realizes the cop\n        is aiming his gun at him!\n        John looks back at Terminator.  He is starting into the black muzzle\n        of the 10-gauge now.  Aimed right at his head.  He realizes he's\n        screwed.  Then something crazy happens...\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Get down.\n\n        John instinctively ducks.  Terminator pulls the trigger. KABOOM!\n\n        THE COP catches the SHOTGUN'S BLAST square in the chest just as he\n        fires the pistol.  The pistol's shot goes wild.\n\n        TERMINATOR pumps another round into him.  The another.  And another.\n        Advancing a step each time he fires, he empties the shotgun into the\n        cop, blowing his backward down the corridor.  The sound is DEAFENING.\n        Then silence.\n\n        THE COP lies still on his back.\n\n44A     Terminator is now standing right over John.  They both watch as the\n        cop, incredibly, sits up unharmed and gets to his feet.  Terminator\n        grabs John roughly by his jacket.  Clutches the kid to his chest\n        then spins around at the cop opens fire with the Beretta.\n\n44B     The \"cop\", who not only isn't a cop, he clearly isn't even human,\n        pulls the trigger so fast it almost seems like a machine-pistol.\n\n        ON TERMINATOR'S BACK, as the 9mm slugs slam into it, punching bloody\n        holes in the motorcycle jacket.\n\n        JOHN is bug-eyed with fear, but completely unscratched.  Terminator's\n        body has blocked the bullets.\n\n        The Beretta CLACKS empty.  Terminator turns at the sound.\n        Shoves John behind a Coke machine.  Drops the empty shotgun.  Starts\n        walking toward the \"cop\".\n        The empty magazine clatters to the floor.\n        The cop inserts another one.  Snaps back the slide.\n        Terminator still has twenty feet to go.\n        He doesn't break his purposeful stride.\n\n        The cop opens fire.  Bullets rake Terminator's chest.  He doesn't\n        even flinch.\n        Ten feet to go.  BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM!  Neither the cop nor Terminator\n        show the slightest change in expression as the gun rips Terminator's\n        wardrobe to shreds.\n\n        CLACK.  The pistol empties again.  Terminator stops two feet in front\n        of the cop.  The appraise each other for a second.\n\n        We realize now that the cop is a terminator too.  We don't know the\n        details yet, but let's call him the T-1000 (since that's what he is).\n        A newer model than the one we've come to know so well (the 800\n        Series \"Arnold\").  This guy's a prototype... and he's got quite a\n        few surprises.\n\n        T-1000 AND TERMINATOR size each other up.  Terminator moves first.\n        He grabs T-1000 in his massive hands but the T-1000 snaps back with a\n        counter-grip.  After about two seconds of intense slamming, the walls\n        on both sides of the corridor have all the plaster smashed in, and\n        the two battling machines have blasted through the wall and\n        disappeared.\n\n        JOHN, totally stunned by all this, remembers to move.  He staggers to\n        his feet.  Stumble-runs toward the parking garage.\n\n44C     THIRD LEVEL CONCOURSE.  A plate glass window EXPLODES and Terminator\n        crashes through to the tile floor like a sack of cement amid the\n        screaming crowd.\n\n44D     T-1000 turns without a word and heads back through the store after\n        John, accelerating slowly into a loping, predatory run.\n\n44E     Terminator is totally still.  A JAPANESE TOURIST cautiously steps\n        forward and takes a picture of the body.  Suddenly, Terminator's\n        eyes snap open.  The stunned tourist backs away.\n\n        He sits up and looks around.  Gets his bearings.  Rises smoothly to\n        his feet.  All servos seem to be working fine.  The tourist's camera\n        whirs as the motor-drive runs on by itself, taking shot after show.\n        The owner isn't even looking through the eyepiece, he's so shocked.\n\n45      INT. PARKING GARAGE\n\n        John is frantically pumping the kick-start of his bike, scared\n        shitless and the damned thing won't start.  His hands are shaking so\n        badly he can't find the choke.  He looks up to see --\n        The T-1000 running down the corridor toward him.\n        John fumbles with the choke.  The bike catches.  He slams it in gear\n        and spins the bike out into the main aisle of the garage.\n\n        John looks back... the T-1000 is behind him, running.  He twists the\n        throttle and guns the little bike forward.  Incredibly, the T-1000\n        is gaining.  This nightmare isn't happening.  John races out the exit\n        ramp, and charges right into the street.\n\n46      EXT. STREET\n\n        John shoots into the busy traffic.  Cuts off a BIG-RIG TOW TRUCK.\n        The DRIVER swears.  Hits his air horn.  What the driver doesn't see\n        is the cop, running faster than O.J. Simpson at the airport, who\n        emerges onto the street and runs back at his truck.\n\n46A     IN THE TRUCK.  The driver hears a thump as something slams against his\n        door, then feels himself pulled right out.  T-1000 slides in and\n        takes his place.  The truck is still rolling along about 25 mph.\n        T-1000 accelerates after John without missing a beat.  It can see him,\n        up ahead, weaving through traffic.\n\n46B     Out of the garage entrance, Terminator roars onto the street on the\n        Harley.\n        He accelerates after the others.\n\n47      EXT. FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL\n\n        John slides his bike down the service ramp faster than he's ever done\n        it before.  He races along the bottom of the canal, turning into a\n        narrower tributary which has vertical sides.\n\n        He looks back.  No sign of pursuit.\n47A     Suddenly he sees the sun blocked out by a great shadow.\n        The Kenworth tow-truck... big as a house, all chrome and roaring\n        diesel engine... crashes through the fence and launches itself right\n        into the center of the canal.\n\n        It crashes down, 15 feet to the ground, going about 60, hits at an\n        angle and tears into the concrete wall with a hideous grinding of\n        metal.  It ricochets back and forth between the walls then, bellowing\n        like a gunshot stegosaurus, it just keep on plowing forward, gathering\n        speed.\n\n47B     John looks back and sees this wall of metal almost filling the narrow\n        concrete canal and he milks every last bit of throttle the little bike\n        has.  The Kenworth is all muscle, tearing along the canal like a train\n        in a tunnel.  Its big tires send up huge sheets of muddy spray,\n        backlit in the setting sun.  It looks like some kind of demon.  And...\n        it's gaining.\n\n47C     ABOVE THEM, on the service road running parallel, Terminator is\n        fighting to overtake them.  He looks down and sees John with the tow-\n        truck from Hell catching up to him.  It is only about twenty feet\n        behind him and still gaining.\n\n47D     ANGLE IN THE CANAL, looking back past a desperate John, at the wall\n        of metal filling frame behind him.\n\n47E     ABOVE, Terminator cuts the bike suddenly hard to the left, leaving the\n        road.  Hitting an earth embankment just right, he jumps the bike into\n        the air like Steve McQueen in \"The Great Escape\" and vaults the fence\n        bordering the canal.  It slams down at the edge of the canal and tears\n        along, inches from the drop-off on a dirt path, accelerating past the\n        truck in the canal below.\n\n47F     John hits some water and slews momentarily, loosing speed.  The\n        massive push-plate on the front of the truck slams into his back\n        fender.  Panicked, he pulls a little ahead.  All this is happening at\n        about sixty miles and hour.  Top speed for the little dirt bike.\n\n47G     SLOW MOTION as Terminator jumps the bike again.  This time the 700-\n        pound Harley sails out into space and drops into the canal.  It arcs\n        down between the truck and John, hitting on its wheels.  It bottoms\n        out, an explosion of sparks under the frame.  Only the ultra-fast\n        reflexes of a machine could keep the bike upright.  Terminator fights\n        for control.\n\n47H     He guns the throttle and the powerful bike roars up beside John's tiny\n        Honda.\n        Terminator sweeps the kid off his machine with one arm and swings him\n        onto the Harley, in front of him.  John's Honda weaves and falls,\n        smashing instantly under thundering tires.\n\n        The Harley roars ahead.  It hits eighty.  Ahead is an overpass, and\n        supporting it is an abutment which bisects the canal into two\n        channels.  The Harley thunders into one channel, which is essentially\n        a short tunnel.\n\n47I     The truck can't fit on either side.  Neither can it stop, at that\n        speed.  Tires locked, it slides on the muddy concrete and piles into\n        the concrete abutment at seventy.\n\n47J     Terminator and John emerge from the tunnel, looking back to see a\n        fireball blasting through behind them as the truck's side-tanks\n        explode.\n\n        Terminator stops the Harley.  John peers around his body to see the\n        destruction.  A burning wheel wobbles out of the tunnel and flops in\n        the mud.  Terminator revs the bike and they roar away, down the canal,\n        disappearing around a bend.\n\n47K     ANGLE ON THE FIRE, as a column of black smoke rises from the overpass.\n        Smoke boils from the tunnel as well, and inside it is a solid wall of\n        flame.  A figure appears in the fire.\n        Just an outline.  Walking slowly... calmly.\n        The figure emerges from the flames.\n\n        It is human-shaped but far from human.  A smooth chrome man.  Not a\n        servo-mechanism like Terminator is underneath, with its complex\n        hydraulics and cables... this thing is a featureless, liquid chrome\n        surface, bending seamlessly at knees and elbows as it walks.  It\n        reminds us of mercury.  A mercury man.  Its face is simple, unformed.\n        Unruffled by thousand-degree heat, it walks toward us.\n\n        With each step detail returns.\n        First the shape and lines of its clothing emerge from the liquid\n        chrome surface, then finer details... buttons, facial features,\n        ears...\n\n47K     But it's still al chrome.  With its last step, the color returns to\n        everything.  It is the cop again... handsome young face, blond hair,\n        mustache.  Icy eyes.  It stops and looks around.\n\n        It is a perfect chameleon.  A liquid metal robot.  A killing machine\n        with the ultimate skills of mimicry for infiltration of human society.\n\n47L     ANGLE NEARBY, as several police cruisers and a fire truck pull up.\n        T-1000 climbs out of the canal behind them.  More cops arrive.  T-1000\n        blends in perfectly.  There are always cops at diasters and scenes of\n        violence.  We now see why its choice of protective mimicry is so\n        perfect.\n        It walks among the other cops unnoticed.\n        Gets into one of the squad cars.  Starts it and drives away.\n\n48      EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT\n\n        Terminator, with John in front of him on the Harley, roars down the\n        empty street.  John cranes his neck around to get a look at the\n        person/thing he is riding with.  The image is strangely reminiscent\n        of father/son, out for an evening ride.\n\n        John is still in shock from the experience of what just happened and\n        he's just a ten-year kid, but he's also John Connor who will someday\n        rise to greatness, and we see a bit of that in him even know.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Whoa... time out.  Stop the bike!\n\n        Terminator immediately complies.  He leans the bike into a turn.\n        They head into a nearby alley.\n\n49      EXT. ALLEY\n\n        Terminator and John rolls into the alley and come to a stop.  John\n        slides off the gas tank.  Terminator impassively stares at him.  John\n        checks him out.  Tentatively speaks.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are\n                a terminator, right?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.\n\n                                JOHN\n                No way!\n\n        John touches Terminator's skin.  Then the blood on his jacket.\n        His mind overloads as the reality of it hits him.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean...\n                whoah!\n                        (stepping back)\n                You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right...\n                but sort of alive outside?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over\n                a metal endoskeleton.\n\n                                JOHN\n                This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh...\n                you're not here to kill me... I figured that part\n                out for myself.  So what's the deal?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                My mission is to protect you.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Yeah?  Who sent you?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed\n                me to be your protector here, in this time.\n\n        John gives him an amazed look.\n\n                                JOHN\n                This is deep.\n\n50      EXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\n        John and Terminator on the bike again, weaving through the side\n        streets.  They blend into the evening traffic.  In the darkness,\n        Terminator's wounds are not readily visible.  John cranes his head up\n        and back.\n\n                                JOHN\n                So this other guy?  He's a terminator too,\n                right, like you?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Not like me.  A T-1000.  Advanced prototype.\n                A mimetic polyalloy.\n\n                                JOHN\n                What does that mean?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Liquid metal.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Radical.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000\n                will not stop until it complete its mission.\n                Ever.\n\n        John mulls that over.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Where we going?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                We have to leave the city, immediately.  And\n                avoid the authorities.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Can I stop by my house?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Negative.  The T-1000 will definitely try to\n                reacquire you there.\n\n                                JOHN\n                You sure?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                I would.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n51      EXT. PAYPHONE\n\n        John is quickly going through his pockets for change.  He has plenty\n        of bills but no quarters.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks but I gotta\n                warn them.  Shit!  You got a quarter?\n\n        Terminator reaches past John and smashes the cover plate off the\n        phone's cash box with the heel of his hand.  A shower of change\n        tumbles out.  Terminator hands one to John.  John dials.\n\n52      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n        Janelle Voight picks up the kitchen phone and cradles it with her\n        shoulder which she continues to chop vegetables with a large knife.\n        She answers sweetly.\n\n                                JANELLE\n                Hello?\n\n                                JOHN\n                        (filtered through phone)\n                Janelle?  It's me.\n\n        In the backyard, John's German Shepherd is going bonkers, barking at\n        something.\n\n                                JANELLE\n                John?  Where are you, honey?  It's late.  You\n                should come home, dear.  I'm making a casserole.\n\n        AT THE PAYPHONE.  John listens, an odd look on his face.  He covers\n        the phone's mouthpiece and turns to Terminator.\n\n                                JOHN\n                        (whispering)\n                Something's wrong.  She's never this nice.\n\n        IN THE VOIGHTS' KITCHEN.  Todd comes through the kitchen's back door.\n        Just home from work.  He ignores Janelle and opens the fridge.  Grabs\n        a carton of milk.  Takes a sip.  Frowns at the dog's barking.\n\n                                TODD\n                What the hell's the goddamn dog barking at?\n                SHUT UP, YOU MUTT!\n\n        TIGHT ON JANELLE as Todd growls around the kitchen behind her.  He\n        passes OUT OF FRAME next to her.  Janelle switches the phone to her\n        other hand then... THUNK!  Her free hand seems to do something out of\n        frame.  There is a gurgling, and the sound of liquid dribbling onto\n        the floor. (Don't go away.  We'll find out what happened in a moment)\n\n        AT THE PAYPHONE\n\n                                JOHN\n                The dog's really barking.  Maybe it's already\n                there.  What should I do?\n\n        Terminator takes the phone from John's hand.  Janelle's voice is\n        floating through the receiver.\n\n                                JANELLE\n                        (filtered)\n                John?  John, are you okay?\n\n        Terminator speaks into the phone in a perfect imitation of John's\n        voice...\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                        (in John's voice)\n                I'm right here.  I'm fine.\n                        (to John, a whisper)\n                What's the dog's name?\n\n                                JOHN\n                Max.\n\n        Terminator nods.  Speaks into the phone.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Hey, Janelle, what's wrong with Wolfy?  I can\n                hear him barking.  Is he okay?\n\n                                JANELLE\n                        (filtered)\n                Wolfy's fine, honey.  Where are you?\n\n        Terminator unceremoniously hangs up the phone.  Turns to John.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Your foster parents are dead.  Let's go.\n\n        Terminator heads for the bike.  John, shocked, stares after him.\n\n53      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE/KITCHEN\n\n        Janelle hangs up the phone.  Her expression is neutral.  Calm.\n\n        PAN OVER along her arm, which is stretched out straight from the\n        shoulder.  Partway along its length her arm has turned smoothly into\n        something else... a metal cylinder which tapers into a sword-like\n        spike.  Now we see Todd Voight PINNED TO A KITCHEN CABINET by the\n        spike which has punched through his milk carton, through his mouth\n        and exits the back of his head into the cabinet door.  His eyes are\n        glassy and lifeless.\n\n        The spike is withdrawn -- SWIISHHTT! -- so rapidly, Todd is actually\n        standing there a second before he slumps out of sight.  THUMP.\n53A     Janelle doesn't bat an eye as the spike smoothly changes shape and\n        color, transforming back into a hand, and then...\n\n53B     JANELLE CHANGES rapidly into the COP we now know as the T-1000.  The\n        change has liquid quality.  T-1000 opens the back door.\n\n54      EXT. VOIGHT HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT\n\n        T-1000 approaches the big German Shepherd, which slinks away from it,\n        barking in fear.  T-1000 walk right into CLOSE UP.  Reaches down, OUT\n        OF FRAME.  We hear that sickening THUNK followed by a shrill YELP.\n        Then T-1000's hand snaps up INTO FRAME holding a bloody dog collar.\n        The tag reads \"MAX\".\n        T-1000 nods thoughtfully.  Heads back to the house.\n\n55      EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\n        Dark.  Off a quiet street.  Terminator stands near the Harley,\n        watching John pace before him.  John's brain is calling time-out.\n        This is all too weird.\n\n                                JOHN\n                I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me\n                it can imitate anything it touches?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Anything it samples by physical contact.\n\n        John thinks about that, trying to grasp their opponent's parameters.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Like it could disguise itself as anything...\n                a pack of cigarettes?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                No.  Only an object of equal size.\n\n        John's still reeling from meeting one terminator, which now seems\n        downright conventional next to the exotic new model.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to\n                get me?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                It can't form complex machines.  Guns and\n                explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It\n                doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid\n                metal shapes.\n\n56      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n        T-1000 walks down the dark hall.  It passes the bathroom and we see\n        the real Janelle's legs through the half-open door.  The shower is\n        running.  Her blood mixes with water on the white tile floor.\n\n56A     In John's bedroom the T-1000 begins searching methodically in the\n        dark.\n        Calmly and dispassionately ripping the room apart for any clues that\n        could lead it to its target.  T-1000 finds a box of audio cassettes\n        marked \"Messages from Mom\".  In it are some letters, and envelopes\n        filled with snapshots.  It begins looking through some of the\n        photos...\n\n        SHOT OF JOHN AND SARAH during the missing years.  Sarah in olive\n        cammos with an RPG 7 grenade launcher, teaching John how to aim.\n        Sarah with a group of military-clad Guatemalan men, standing next to\n        cases of Stinger missiles.  John and Sarah in a Contra camp, deep in\n        the mountains.\n\n57      EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\n        John is now sitting on the curb, lost in stunned thought.  Terminator\n        stands above him, watching the street like a Doberman.  He glances\n        down at John.\n\n                                JOHN\n                We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places\n                like that.  For a while she was with this crazy\n                ex-Green Beret guy, running guns.  Then there\n                were some other guys.  She'd shack up with\n                anybody she could learn from.  So then she\n                could teach me how to be this great military\n                leader.  Then she gets busted and it's like...\n                sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  Didn't you\n                know?  It's like... everything I'd been brought\n                up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right?\n                I hated her for that.\n                        (he looks up)\n                But everything she said was true.\n                        (he stands)\n                We gotta get her out of there.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for\n                success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and\n                wait for you to make contact with her.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Oh, great.  And what happens to her?\n\n        Terminator's reply is matter-of-fact.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Typically, the subject being copied is\n                terminated.\n\n                                JOHN\n                TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me?\n                We gotta right now!\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Negative.  She is not a mission priority.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!\n\n        John strides away.  Terminator goes after him and grabs him arm.\n        John struggles against the grip.  Which doesn't do him much good.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Hey, goddammit!  What's your problem?\n\n        Starts dragging John back to the bike.  John spots a couple of\n        collage-age slab-o-meat JOCK-TYPES across the street and starts\n        yelling to them.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Help!  HELP!!  I'm being kidnapped!  Get this\n                psycho off of me!\n\n        The TWO JOCKS start toward him.  John yells in outrage to Terminator.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Let go of me!!\n\n        To his surprise, Terminator's hand opens so fast John falls right on\n        his butt.\n        He looks up at the open hand.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Oww!  Why'd you do that?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                You told me to.\n\n        John stares at him in amazement as he realizes...\n\n                                JOHN\n                You have to do what I say?!\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                That is one of my mission parameters.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Prove it... stand on one foot.\n\n        Terminator expressionlessly lifts one leg.\n        John grins.  He's the first on his block...\n\n                                JOHN\n                Cool!  My own terminator.  This is great!\n\n        The two guys get there and look at Terminator standing there calmly\n        with one leg up in the air.  This big guy in black leather and dark\n        glasses, standing like a statue.\n\n                                FIRST JOCK\n                Hey, kid.  You okay?\n\n        John turns to him.  No longer needing to be rescued.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Take a hike, bozo.\n\n                                FIRST JOCK\n                Yeah?  Fuck you, you little dipshit.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Dipshit?  Did you say dipshit?!\n                        (to Terminator)\n                Grab this guy.\n\n        Terminator complies instantly, hoisting him one-handed by the collar.\n        the guy's legs are pinwheeling.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Now who's the dipshit, you jock douchebag?\n\n        Immediately, things get out of hand.  The guy's friend jumps behind\n        Terminator and tries to grab him in a full nelson --\n        Terminator throws the first guy across the hood of a car --\n        Grabs the second by the hair, whips out his .45 in a quick blur, and\n        aims the muzzle at the guy's forehead.\n        John grabs Terminator's arm with a yell as he pulls the trigger --\n        John's weight is just enough to deflect the gun a few inches.  The\n        guy flinches, stunned by the K-BOOM next to his ear.  He stares,\n        shocked.  Pissing himself.  John is freaking out, too.\n        He screams at Terminator.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Put the gun down!  NOW!!\n\n        Terminator sets the .45 on the sidewalk.  John scoops it up fast then\n        turns to the shocked civilians, who can't believe what just happened.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Walk away.\n\n        They do.  Fast.  John grabs Terminator by the arm and tugs him toward\n        the bike.  John still holds the gun, reluctant to give it back.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Of course.  I'm a terminator.\n\n        John stares at him.  Having your own terminator just became a little\n        bit less fun to him.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not\n                a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that?\n                You can't just go around killing people!\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Why?\n\n                                JOHN\n                Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Why?\n\n                                JOHN\n                You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.\n\n        Terminator doesn't get it.  John just stares at him.  Frightened at\n        what just almost happened.  He gets a glimpse of the responsibility\n        that comes with power.  Finally he hands the .45 back to Terminator,\n        who puts it away.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.  You wanna come\n                along, that's fine with me.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n58      INT. VOIGHT HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n        T-1000 finds an envelope... a letter from Sarah to John sent since\n        she's been at Pescadero State Hospital.  It reads the return address\n        on the envelope.  It has what it needs.  It picks up a tape player\n        and the battered shoebox full of Sarah's tapes and exits.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n59      CLOSE ON A BLACK & WHITE PHOTOGRAPH.  The image is a nightmare from\n        the past.  It is a surveillance camera still-frame from the L.A.\n        police station where the first terminator made such an impression in\n        1984.  We see the blurry forms of the cop frozen in the emergency\n        lights of a burning corridor.\n\n        A black-clad figure stands at the end of the corridor.  The guy has\n        short-cropped hair and dark glasses.  An AR-80 assault rifle in one\n        hand, and a 12-gauge in the other -- holding them both like toy\n        pistols.\n        ANOTHER PHOTO is slapped on top of the first.  Another still-frame\n        blow-up is placed over the last.  Terminator looms in CLOSEUP.\n\n                                DETECTIVE WEATHERSBY (O.S.)\n                These were taken at the West Highland police\n                station in 1984.  You were there.\n\n        WIDER.  We're in --\n\n59A     INT. INTERVIEW ROOM/PESCADERO - NIGHT\n\n        The photos are lying on the table in front of Sarah, placed there by\n        DETECTIVE WEATHERSBY.  His partner DET. MOSSBERG, and Dr. Silberman,\n        sit at the table as well.  Two uniformed cops, plus Douglas, stand by\n        the door.  Sarah stares listlessly at the top photo.  She's\n        withdrawn, haggard... drugged-looking.\n\n                                MOSSBERG\n                He killed seventeen police officers that night.\n                Recognize him?\n\n        Weathersby slaps another black-and-white eight-by-ten on the table.\n        A closeup of Terminator taken by the Japanese tourist at the mall.\n        It's the same face.\n\n                                MOSSBERG\n                This one was taken by a Japanese tourist today.\n\n        Sarah doesn't react.  It's hard to tell she's thinking.  Whether she's\n        up hope or is just in a drugged stupor.\n\n                                WEATHERSBY\n                Ms. Connor, you've been told that your son's\n                missing.  His foster parents have been murdered,\n                and we know this guy's involved.  Talk to us.\n                Don't you care?\n\n        Sarah stares up at him.  A cold and empty stare.  He glances at\n        Silberman.\n        Then at his partner.\n\n                                MOSSBERG\n                We're wasting out time.\n\n        One of the uniformed cops opens the door and Mossberg strides into\n        the hall.  Weathersby and the two uniforms follow him out, with\n        Silberman right behind.\n\n                                SILBERMAN\n                Sorry, gentleman...\n\n        TIGHT ON SARAH, slumped under the bright lights.  Totally out of it.\n        Then we see her hand, creeping along the edge of the table toward the\n        stack of photos.  She slips off the paper clip binding the stills\n        together, and hides it between her fingers.  Douglas jerks her up by\n        the arms and leads her out.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n60      INT. SARAH'S CELL\n\n        Douglas inches up the last of Sarah's restraints.  Then her leans\n        over her... looking down.  Even wrecked as she is, we see the beauty\n        in her face.  He bends down.  We think he's going to kiss her.\n        Instead he runs his tongue across her face like a dog would.  She\n        seems not to even see him.  Her dull eyes past him.  He can't\n        provoke a reaction.  Even here, strapped down, the two of them alone,\n        she give him no superiority.  He smirks and leaves.  We hear the\n        sound of his night-stick tapping its way down the corridor, growing\n        fainter.\n\n        Sarah's eyes snap suddenly alert.  There is intensity and resolve in\n        them.  She slips the paper clip out from between her fingers and\n        awkwardly spreads it open into a straight piece of wire.  With slow,\n        painful concentration she moves it toward the lock of the restraints\n        that bind her wrists to the bed at her sides.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n61      EXT. ROAD - NIGHT\n\n        Terminator and John charge through the night on the Harley.\n        Streetlights flare past them like comets.  Two serious guys with a\n        mission.  One a ten-year old kid, the other a half-man/half-machine\n        cyborg from the post-Apocalyptic future.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n62      INT.

But Sarah\n        taught herself a lot of things in her years of hiding.\n\n        SARAH, her hands free, sits up and releases the Velcro straps on her\n        feet.  She rolls off the bed and we see her in a whole new light.\n        She is totally alert, almost feral in her movements.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n63      EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE\n\n        GUARD SHACK.  A bored security guard glances up as an LAPD black-and-\n        white pulls up.  He raises the barricade and nods at the T-1000/cop\n        as it passes.\n\n        THE CRUISER pulls in next to the other police vehicles.  The T-1000\n        walks toward the main entrance.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n64      INT. SARAH'S CELL/CORRIDOR\n\n        Sarah is using the paper clip on the door lock.  She hears an echoing\n        tapping sound.  It's getting louder, coming her way.  She goes back\n        to work on the lock.\n\n65      IN THE CORRIDOR.  Douglas the attendant is tapping his stick along\n        the wall like he does every night on his rounds.  He shines a little\n        mag-light in the windows of the cells as he passes, barely slowing.\n\n65A     He rounds the corner.  His footsteps echo in the dark hallway.\n        The tip of the stick hits the wall.\n        Tap, tap, tap... getting closer to Sarah's cell.  He stops at the\n        door.  He is about to shine his light in when he notices that a\n        utility closet across the hall is open.  He goes to shut it,\n        absently flicking his light into the dark closet.  He notices\n        something strange among the buckets and cleaning supplies.  A mop lies\n        on the floor, with its handle snapped off about halfway up.  The\n        other half is missing.\n\n        Douglas ponders this for half a second, then hears a SOUND behind him\n        and spins around.  The sound he heard was Sarah's cell door.\n        The missing two feet of MOP HANDLE fill his vision as it CRACKS\n        viciously across the bridge of his nose.\n\n        250 pounds of doughy attendant hit the floor like a sack of cement.\n        Sarah slams the makeshift baton down expertly across the back of his\n        head, bouncing him off the linoleum.  Lights out, Douglas.\n        She drags him into her cell and locks him in with his own keys.  Then\n        swaps her mop-handle for his nice heavy night-stick.\n\n65B     Sarah moves down the dark corridor, cat-stepping in her bare feet.\n        She holds the baton like a pro, laid back along the forearm, police-\n        style.  She looks dangerous.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n66      INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE/CORRIDOR\n\n        A long corridor ends at a reception area, which is closed, and a\n        NIGHT RECEIVING DESK, which is a glass window where they can buzz you\n        in through a heavy door.  A NIGHT NURSE types at a desk nearby.  She\n        looks up at the sound of footsteps and sees a young cop (T-1000)\n        walking toward her.\n\n                                T-1000\n                You have a Sarah Connor here?\n\n        She assumes he's with the other cops.  Smiles.\n\n                                NIGHT NURSE\n                Running late, aren't you?\n\n        She turns to the inner door to buzz him in and sees Silberman and the\n        cops coming toward the door from the other side.\n\n                                NIGHT NURSE\n                Your friends are on their way out now...\n\n        When she turns back to the window, T-1000's no longer there.  She\n        goes to the counter and leans out to see if he's at the drinking\n        fountain or someplace.  No.  Reception is empty.  And so is the long\n        corridor beyond.  She frowns.  Too weird.\n\n66A     Silberman comes through the solenoid door with Mossberg and\n        Weathersby, the two uniformed cops, and the hospital security guard.\n        The guard retrieves his 9mm pistol from a lock-out box behind the\n        night desk.  Silberman faces him.\n\n                                SILBERMAN\n                Lewis, see these gentleman out and them lock\n                up for the night.\n\n        The security guard nods.  Silberman goes back into the secure area of\n        the hospital and the cops walk down the long corridor to the main\n        doors.  No sign of T-1000.  Mossberg and the other cops exit, and\n        the guard locks the door behind them.\n\n66B     The guard walks slowly back along the long corridor.  The hall is\n        dark, with the light at the night desk far ahead like a sanctuary.\n        His footsteps ring hollowly on the tile floor.  His keys jingle.\n\n66C     ANGLE ON FLOOR as the guard's feet pass through FRAME.  An instant\n        later the floor starts to move.\n        It shivers and bulges upward like a liquid mass, still retaining the\n        two-tone checkerboard of the tile.  It hunches up silently into a\n        quivering shadow in the darkness past the guard.\n\n66D     Up ahead we hear typing.  The night nurse has her back to us, working.\n        The guard stops as the drinking fountain.  Bends to take a sip.\n        Behind him the fluid mass as reaches six feet of height and begins to\n        resolve rapidly into a human figure.  It loses the color and texture\n        of the tile and becomes... THE GUARD.\n\n        T-1000's mass has been spread out a quarter of an inch thick over\n        several square yards of floor.  The guard walked over the T-1000, and\n        his structure was sampled that instant.  Now we see it drawing in and\n        pulling up to form the figure of the guard.\n\n        The T-1000/Guard's feet are the last to form, the last of the \"liquid\n        floor\" pulling in to form shiny black guard shoes.  The shoes detach\n        with a faint sucking sound from the real floor as the T-1000/Guard\n        takes its first step.\n\n66E     The real guard spins at the sound of footsteps to see... himself.\n        He has one deeply disturbing moment to consider the ramifications of\n        that.  Then he sees his double calmly raise its hand and,\n        inexplicably, points his right index finger directly at the real\n        guard's face, about a foot away.  In a split second, the finger\n        spears out, elongating into a thin steel rod which snaps out like a\n        stiletto, slamming into the guard's eye.\n        It punches into the corner of the eye, past the eyeball like a trans-\n        orbital lobotomy tool, and emerges from the back of the guard's skull.\n\n        Life quietly empties from the guard's face.  He is dead weight,\n        hanging from the rod/finger with suddenly reacts -- SSSNICK.  As the\n        guard slumps, the T-1000 takes his weight easily with one hand and\n        walks him, like it's carrying a suit on a hanger, back toward the\n        night desk.  The wounds are so tiny, no blood drips onto the floor.\n\n66F     ON THE NIGHT NURSE, glancing up as the T-1000/Guard walks past,\n        dragging something casually which she can't see because it's below\n        the countertop.\n\n                                NIGHT NURSE\n                Whatcha got, Lewis?\n\n                                T-1000/GUARD\n                Just some trash.\n\n        She nods, uninterested.  Keeps typing.  T-1000 moves past, dragging\n        the unseen guard toward a closet down the hall from the night\n        receiving station.  T-1000/Guard removes the Browning High-Power\n        pistol and the keys from the real guard's belt, then stuffs the body\n        into the utility closet.\n\n66G     INT. CORRIDOR/NIGHT RECEIVING DESK\n\n        T-1000/Guard comes back out and glances at the nurse.\n\n                                T-1000/GUARD\n                All set.\n\n        She glances toward it.  Sees the Beretta in its holster.\n\n                                NIGHT NURSE\n                Gotta check the gun first, Lewis.\n\n                                T-1000/GUARD\n                Yeah, sorry.\n\n        T-1000 opens the locker and blocks it from her view with its body as\n        it mimes putting the gun in.\n\n66H     CLOSE ANGLE ON T-1000'S CHEST, from inside the locker.  Instead of\n        setting the gun in the locker, it inserts the pistol into it own\n        chest, where is disappears inside like it was dropped into a pot of\n        hot fudge.  It withdraws its hand.  The chest is once again a surface\n        that looks like cloth, buttons, name-tag etc.  You'd ever guess it was\n        really an intelligent liquid metal.\n\n        T-1000 slams the locker door and waits as the nurse hits the button\n        unlocking the door with a BUZZ-CLACK.  T-1000/Guard goes through.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n67      INT. ISOLATION SECURITY CHECKPOINT\n\n        A small room before a short SALLY-PORT corridor designed to prevent\n        violent inmates from making a run for it.  There are doors at each\n        end.  The first one is barred like a jail-cell door, and the second\n        is a steel fire door.  The attendants have a video monitor with which\n        they can see the corridor on the other side of the doors.\n\n        The two bored attendants barely notice the T-1000/Guard as it\n        approaches.  Looks briefly at a chart next to the door, seeing\n        SARAH CONNOR is in #19.\n\n67A     IN THE ISOLATION WARD, the T-1000 passes a nurses' station which looks\n        a cage, walled in by heavy metal mesh.  Silberman, leaning in the open\n        doorway, is talking to an attendant in the cage.  He doesn't glance\n        twice at Lewis the Guard passing by.\n\n68      SARAH, moving like a ghost in the darkened corridor, hears footsteps\n        coming and quietly but quickly unlocks a cell next to her with\n        Douglas' master key.\n68A     She slips into the cell and waits as the footsteps pass.\n        We glimpse the T-1000/Guard pass the window.\n        She waits as the footsteps fade away.  She looks over.  A female\n        inmate, strapped to a bed, watches her with bird-like eyes.  She puts\n        a finger to her lips -- SSHHH.  The inmate nods.  Sarah exits.\n\n68B     POV MOVING TOWARD nurse's station.  We hear Silberman's voice,\n        reviewing medication with the night attendant.\n\n        ON SILBERMAN, yawning, looking at his watch.\n        He turns to go... Sarah is there.\n        She slams into him, hurling him through the door into the cage and\n        follows him in.  The orderly jumps up, going for his stunner, but she\n        nails him with Douglas' baton.  WHAP-WHAP-WHAP!  You can barely see\n        the thing she's swinging it so fast.  The guys goes down.\n\n        Silberman lunges for the alarm button and she cracks down hard on his\n        arm.  He cries out and grabs his wrist.\n        She grabs him by the hair and slams him face down on the desk,\n        smacking him behind the knees expertly with the baton.\n        His legs buckle and he drops to his knees with his chin on the desk.\n        She pins him with one hand.  He face is full of outraged disbelief.\n\n                                SILBERMAN\n                You broke my arm!\n\n                                SARAH\n                There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker.\n                That's one.  Now don't move!\n\n68B     Moving rapidly, she whips open a medication drawer and grabs a\n        syringe.\n        They keep a few of these handy for tranking unruly patients.  She\n        jams it into the orderly's butt and fires the whole shot.  Still\n        holding the empty syringe, she sees what she need next.\n        They keep the toxic cleaning supplies in here to keep the inmates from\n        drinking Drano.  She grabs a plastic jug of LIQUID PLUM'R and slams\n        it down on the desk inches from Silberman's eyes.\n\n        She jams the empty syringe into the plastic jug.\n        Draws back the plunger.  The syringe fills with blue liquid.\n        She whips it out of the jug and jams the needle into Silberman's neck.\n        His horrified eyes rack toward it.  10 cc's of blue death fill the\n        cylinder.\n        Her thumb hovers over the plunger.\n        She jerks him to his feet by the collar and gets a tight grip on him,\n        then hauls him through the door.\n\n69      IN THE CORRIDOR outside cell #19 the T-1000 stops and looks in the\n        window.  Douglas, his face a bloody mess, yells to be heard.\n\n                                DOUGLAS\n                Open the door!  The goddamn bitch is loose in\n                the halls!\n\n        To Douglas' amazement, Lewis the Guard turns impassively and walks\n        away, leaving him shouting soundlessly at the window.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n70      EXT.

Terminator stares\n        at John a beat.  Then mimics the gesture.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                I swear I will not kill anyone.\n\n        Terminator stops the bike and gets off.\n        The guard, sensing trouble, has his gun drawn as he comes out of the\n        shack.  Terminator walks toward him drawing his .45 smoothly.  BLAM!\n        He shoots the guard accurately in the thigh.\n        The guy drops, screaming and clutching his leg.\n        Terminator kicks the guard's gun away, then smashes the phone in the\n        shack with his fist.  He pushes the button to raise the gate and walks\n        back to the bike.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                He'll live.\n\n        Terminator climbs onto the bike.  They drive toward the hospital,\n        heading down an ambulance ramp to an underground receiving area.\n\n71      INT. ISOLATION FLOOR\n\n        The attendants at the security checkpoint look up at the monitor as\n        someone enters the corridor.  They see Sarah, holding Silberman at\n        syringe-point.\n        Sarah speaks to them through an intercom on the wall.  Her voice\n        comes through the speaker.\n\n                                SARAH\n                Open it or he'll be dead before he hits the\n                floor.\n\n        The attendants' adrenaline levels just went off the scale.  The first\n        attendant shakes him head no.  The amperage here is really high.  The\n        second attendant keys the intercom switch.\n\n                                2ND ATTENDANT\n                There's no way, Connor.

One of them hits the solenoid\n        button.  The far door unlocks.\n\n71A     IN THE LOCKOUT CORRIDOR.  Sarah pushes Silberman ahead of her.\n        The nearer, barred door must be unlocked manually.\n        One of the attendants cautiously approaches.  Nervously unlocks it.\n\n                                SARAH\n                Step back!\n        \n        He does.

She comes through with Silberman, giving them a wide\n        berth.  Starts backing down the hall away from them, still holding\n        her hostage.  She's actually pulling this off.\n\n71B     ANGLE FROM BEHIND HER.  What we can see, but she can't see, it a\n        third orderly waiting just around the corner.  He's poised, ready to\n        jump her when she comes abreast of him.\n\n        ON SARAH backing up.  She reaches the corner.\n        The third attendant lunges, grabbing her syringe-hand.\n        Sarah spins on the orderly and catches him across the throat with the\n        nightstick.  He loses interest fast, dropping to his knees and\n        gagging.  Silberman pulls away, screaming at the top of his lungs\n\n                                SILBERMAN\n                Get her!\n\n        They scramble up as Sarah takes off like a shot around the corner.\n        One of them hits the panic button and ALARMS begin to sound.\n\n72      IN THE ISOLATION WARD, the T-1000 is looking in at a very stoned\n        attendant inside the nurses' station when the alarms shriek through\n        the halls.  It reaches into its chest and pulls out the 9mm pistol.\n        Heads for the security entrance.\n\n73      IN ANOTHER CORRIDOR in the maze of the vast hospital, Sarah flies\n        past us, her bare feet slapping on the cold tiles.  The orderlies\n        charge after her.\n        She's like an animal in a maze.  She turns the corner, glancing off\n        the wall, and sprints on without slowing.  She reaches a steel door.\n        Tries it.  Locked.\n        Footsteps like a drum solo behind her.\n\n        She fumbles with Douglas' keys, breathing hard.  Jams the master in.\n        The orderlies are bearing down on her at full tilt.\n        Sarah gets the door open.  Dives through.  Slams it.\n        She turns a deadbolt knob just as the first orderly grabs the latch\n        on the other side.  He's too late.\n\n        Sarah sees them beyond the window, fumbling with their keys.\n\n73A     Sarah is in another sally-port corridor.  A jail-cell type barred\n        door is between her and the corridors of the ward beyond.\n        She sprints to the walls of bars, jams her key into the door.\n        She unlocks and pulls open this door just as she hears the latch of\n        the one she just came through being unlocked.\n\n        She flings herself frantically through the barred door as the first\n        orderly comes through behind her.\n        She slams the bars shut.  CLANG.\n        Her keys are dangling from the lock on the other side from her.\n        The orderly is racing at her, white-lipped with rage.\n\n        She reaches back through the bars, turns the key, and purposefully\n        snaps it off in the lock.  An instant later the big orderly slams\n        against the door, grabbing through the bars for her as she dances\n        back just out of reach.\n        He lunges against the steel bars, unbelievably pissed off.\n\n        Sarah takes off running, looking back at the frustrated orderlies.\n        They're shouting at each other, unable to fit their keys into the\n        lock --\n        The broken-off key tip makes it impossible to get their keys in.\n        Silberman shouts at them.\n\n                                SILBERMAN\n                Go around, goddamnit!  Go around!!\n\n        The orderlies run back the way they came, and along a cross-corridor\n        to another set of doors.\n\n73B     ON SARAH as she rounds a corner and sees the elevators ahead.\n        Now she's home-free.  At a full-tilt sprint, she's nearly there when\n        the elevator doors part...\n\n        TERMINATOR steps out... his head swivels to face her.\n        Sarah reacts, stricken by the image from her worst nightmares.\n        Her eyes go wide as momentum carries her forward.\n        Her bare feet slip on the slick tile.  She slams to the floor,\n        staring up at the leather-clad figure with the shotgun.\n\n        She loses all semblance of courage and some of her sanity.\n        She's not even aware that she is screaming, or what would be\n        screaming if she could get the breath to do it.\n        In slowed-down dream-time, Sarah scrambles back along the floor like a\n        crab, spinning and clawing her way to her feet along the wall.\n\n        She runs like the wind, like in her nightmare.  If she looked back she\n        would have seen John step warily out of the corridor behind\n        Terminator.  John, however, catches a glimpse of the fleeing Sarah and\n        figures out instantly what happened.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Mom!!  Wait!\n\n        Sarah doesn't hear.  She has clicked fully into her own nightmare.\n        They take off running after Sarah.\n\n73C     She is pelting down the long corridor, back the way she came.  As she\n        reaches an intersection with a cross-corridor a white-clad figure\n        blurs from that corridor.  The orderly hits her in a flying tackle.\n        She skids across the floor, shrieking and struggling.  The other two\n        orderlies leap into the fray.\n\n                                SARAH\n                No!  Help me!  Goddamnit, it's gonna kill us\n                all!!!\n\n        She is shouting, pleading, trying to get them to understand what is\n        coming.  They grab her thrashing arms and legs.  They don't even look\n        where the out-of-control woman is pointing... back along the corridor.\n\n        They have pinned her to the cold tiles, a ring of faces above her.\n        Silberman leans down to her, holding a syringe with a heavy dose of\n        trank.  Sarah cranes her neck and sees the dark silhouette of\n        Terminator coming up behind them.  It is exactly her nightmare.\n        She screams in utter hopelessness.\n\n        Terminator, holding the shotgun in one hand, reaches down and grabs\n        one of the orderlies with his other hand.  He hurls the 200-pound\n        guys against the far wall of the corridor.  SMACK!  He drops to the\n        floor.\n        The other two orderlies react instantly, leaping onto the intruder.\n        Terminator seems to disappear for a moment under the two big guys.\n        Then there is an explosion of white-clad figures, as the orderlies are\n        flung outward like they stepped on a land mine.\n        One crashes through a window of safety glass and is caught before a\n        two-story fall by the outer steel bars.  The other crashes through an\n        office door, splintering it into kindling.\n\n        Silberman has jumped to hold Sarah.  He is grabbed by a roll of skin\n        at the back of his neck and lifted like a cat.  The doctor feel his\n        feet pedaling above the ground.  He looks into the expressionless\n        face.  And it hit him.  Sarah was right... this guy isn't human.\n        He feels the fabric of reality crumbling.\n        Then he feels himself flying through the air.  The wall smacks him,\n        then the floor kicks him in the face.  He decides to lie there a\n        second.\n\n        Sarah blinks, staring up at the figure looming over her.\n        John kneels next to her.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Mom, are you okay?\n\n        She looks from Terminator to John.  Back to Terminator.\n        Is this a nightmare?  Or has she finally gone truly bad?\n\n        Incredibly, Terminator politely reaches his hand down to her, offering\n        to help her up.  The last thing she ever expected to see.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Come with me if you want to live.\n\n        The orderlies are stirring.\n\n                                JOHN\n                It's all right, Mom.  He's here to help.\n\n        Sarah, is a daze, takes the huge hand in her shaking fingers.\n        Terminator lifts her to her feet.\n\n73D     John sees a GUARD standing thirty feet away, on the other side of the\n        walls of bars.  John doesn't know what we know, but he knows\n        something's not right with this guy.  Terminator turns to follow\n        John's gaze.\n        The T-1000 had its pistol in its hand, at its side.\n        Terminator pushes John behind him.  They start backing up.\n\n73E     The T-1000 walks forward, reaching the bars.  It doesn't stop.\n        Its body divides like jello around the bars.  As it squeezes itself\n        through like metal playdough, its surface reforms perfectly on our\n        side.  We see it deform and squeeze through like a viscous paste\n        forced past an obstacle.\n        Silberman has recovered enough to be sitting up and watching this.\n        That faint snapping sound is his mind.\n        There is a CLANK and we see that the guard's gun has caught against\n        the bars... the only solid object.  The T-1000 turns its wrist and\n        tries again, slipping the gun endwise through the gap.\n\n73F     Sarah is agape.  Not reacting.  It's been a heavy day for her.\n        Terminator grabs John by the seat of his pants and hooks him up onto\n        his back.  John grabs him around the neck.  Terminator raises the\n        shotgun and starts backing up.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Go!  Run!\n\n        Sarah doesn't need to be told twice.\n        T-1000 walks toward them, opening fire with the Browning Hi-Power.\n        Terminator straight-arms the 12-guage like a pistol and FIRES.\n        The stunned orderlies flop face down on the floor as the corridor is\n        filled with high-velocity lead.  One of them, stupidly running for the\n        cross-corridor, gets hit by the T-1000.\n\n        Terminator is hammered by several slugs, and the T-1000 is cratered\n        by two buckshots hits.  It staggers, but comes on.  In the craters\n        we see bright mercury before they close and reseal, disappearing in a\n        second.\n\n73G     Terminator makes it around the corner and breaks into a run.  Ahead,\n        Sarah is already at the elevator.  Terminator and John pile in and\n        John slaps the button for \"Garage Level\".\n\n        The doors start to close.  T-1000 clears the corner.\n        Terminator slams John and Sarah back against the side walls as the\n        T-1000 charges at them, rapid firing the Browning.\n        The rounds hit the steel doors as they close.\n        T-1000 keeps pumping them at the closing gap.\n73H     Inside, they see the backside of the doors denting with the hits that\n        are punching holes in the other side.\n\n73I     The Browning locks open, empty.  T-1000 drops it without a glance\n        back.  The doors close.  K-WHAM!  The T-1000 hits them a split second\n        later.  The elevator hasn't moved yet.  SSWWIKK!\n\n73J     A sword-like blade rams through in between the doors, forcing them\n        open.  Terminator jams the shotgun through the widening gap.  Punches\n        the muzzle right INTO T-1000's face -- BOOM!!\n73K     We get a glimpse of the T-1000's head blown apart by the blast.  It\n        is hurtled back.  The doors close.  The car descends.\n\n73L     ON THE T-1000, outside the elevator.  Its head, which is blown apart\n        into two doughy masses lying on the shoulders, reforms quickly.\n        There is no trace of the injury.  It sees the closed door and jams its\n        hands between them, its fingertips becoming pry-bars.  It pulls the\n        doors apart with inhuman strength\n73M     and LEAPS INTO THE OPEN SHAFT.\n        It falls two floors and...\n\n74      IN THE ELEVATOR.  Out trio hears a loud THUMP on the roof.\n        Terminator, reloading the shotgun, looks up.\n        Sarah grabs the .45 from his waistband and aims it at the ceiling.\n        BEAT...\n        Then CLANGG!! a swordlike shaft punches through the ceiling and spears\n        down four feet into the elevator car.\n        It is inches from Sarah's face.\n        She opens fire, BAM-BAM-BAM -- right through the roof.\n        Lighting-fast the lance withdraws and thrusts down again, slashing\n        Terminator's jacket, and missing John by inches.\n        Terminator chambers a round and K-BOOM! the 12-guage opens a hole in\n        the ceiling.\n        Terminator rocks out in a fury of firing/cocking/firing as the metal\n        shafts slash down again and again.  Sarah yells in pain as one of them\n        slices open her upper arm.\n\n75      The doors open.  Sarah pulls John out as soon as the gap is wide\n        enough.\n        They emerge into the basement.  We see the Harley parked nearby.\n\n        Terminator, in a rearguard action, fires another blast through the\n        ceiling and runs out.  He throws his leg over the Harley, kicks it to\n        life with one powerful stroke and then whips something out of the\n        inner pocket of his jacket.  He throws it to John.  A road flare!?\n\n76      In the elevator, the T-1000 has bashed a hole in the ceiling big\n        enough to...\n        Pour itself through.\n        A massive blob of mercury extrudes from the opening.  The mass drops\n        through the hole, down out of frame, then comes back up into frame\n        as Officer X.\n\n        It seems to need just a second to get its mental act together after\n        doing this king of taffy-pull with itself.  It opens its eyes and\n        sees --\n\n77      TERMINATOR, the shot gun held in his teeth, astride the roaring\n        Harley twenty feet away.  Terminator twists the throttle and pops the\n        clutch.\n        The back tire screams on the concrete.  The front wheel lifts off the\n        ground and the heavy bike launches in a thundering wheelie.\n\n        Terminator gets off just before the bike hurtles into the elevator.\n        The Harley slams the T-1000 square and smashes it right through the\n        back wall of the elevator.\n        Terminator rolls to his feet.\n        Johns strikes the flare on the concrete.  Tosses it.\n        Terminator catches the life flare with one hand.\n        Levels the shotgun with the other.\n        With his last round he blows a big hole in the bike's gas tank.\n        Gas splashes everywhere, covering the struggling T-1000.\n        Terminator tosses the flare.  KA-VOOOM!\n\n        The explosion knocks Terminator backward off his feet, enveloping him\n        in the fireball.  He gets up, smoking, and runs after John and Sarah\n        toward the exit ramp.\n\n78      AT THE EXIT RAMP.  They are partway up when a blue-and-white hospital\n        security car comes screeching down the other way.\n        Without breaking stride Sarah runs right at the car.  It skids to a\n        shrieking halt.  She's in the guy's face with the .45 in both hands.\n\n                                SARAH\n                Out of the car!!\n\n        The patrol guy is thinking what he can try when BLAM! she puts a round\n        through the glass next to his head.\n\n                                SARAH\n                RIGHT NOW!\n\n        The door opens and the guy is coming out with his hands up as\n        Terminator arrives.  The cyborg flings the rent-a-cop out of the way\n        and slides behind the wheel.  Sarah gets John into the back seat and\n        dives into the front passenger seat as --\n\n78A     Terminator slams the car into reverse and punches it, lighting up the\n        tires on the slick ramp.\n        Terminator hands the shotgun over his shoulder to John and tells him\n        to reload.  John pulls some shells from the pocket of his army jacket\n        and starts feeding them in.\n        Terminator power backward up the ramp, scraping along one wall, barely\n        in control.  Because...\n\n79      The T-1000 is running at them out of the inferno below.\n        This guy won't quit.  Shifting from chrome mode to cop-form as it\n        runs.\n        It sprints up the ramp after the retreating car.  T-1000 is gaining.\n\n80      Terminator hands Sarah another magazine for the .45.  She snatches\n        it, drops the other out, and slaps in the new one.  Cocks the slide.\n        The car backs along the service driveway toward the security gate.\n        John hands the shot gun back to Terminator.\n        He leans out the window and takes aim at the pursuer.\n        The T-1000's face is right in the headlights.\n80A     Terminator fires, blowing a hole in its shoulder.  Shiny liquid metal\n        visible in the hole, which then closes.\n80B     Sarah, half out the passenger window, opens fire.\n        The car crashes backward through the security barricade.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                        (calmly)\n                Hang on.\n\n        He cuts the wheel hard.  The car slews into a reverse 180, swapping\n        ends with a screech.\n        T-1000 is almost on them.\n        Terminator punches it.  The car accelerates forward.\n\n80C     T-1000 leaps.  Lands on the trunk.\n        Its hand is a metal crowbar slammed down through the trunk lid.\n        Feet dragging on the pavement, it slams its other hand down,\n        punching another metal hook into the trunk lid, pulling itself up.\n        Terminator turns to Sarah.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Drive.\n\n        Terminator heaves himself half out the driver's window.  Sarah slaps\n        her foot down on the throttle and steers from the passenger side.\n\n80D     T-1000, fully on the car now, holds on with one hook-hand while it\n        slams the other into the back window, sweeping away the glass and\n        missing John by inches as he ducks.\n        It draws back for another swing, lunging forward as --\n\n80E     Terminator whips the shotgun over the roof of the car.\n        Fires point-blank.\n        Hits the T-1000's arm just above the \"hand\" which anchors it to the\n        car.  The 12-guage blows the arm apart, severing the hook-hand.\n\n80F     T-1000 tumbles backward off the accelerating car.\n        John looks out the back window, his eyes wide.\n        He sees the T-1000 roll to his feet and continue running.\n        But he's dropping way behind now.  Sarah has the car floored and the\n        liquid-metal killer won't catch them on foot.\n\n80G     John watches, in awe, as the \"crowbar hand\", stuck into the trunk\n        right in front of him, reverts to the neutral polyalloy... a kind of\n        think mercury.  The gray metal slides off the trunk of the car and\n        falls onto the road to lie there in a quivering blob.\n\n80H     The car speeds off into the night.\n        REVERSE on the T-1000, walking now, coming right up into closeup,\n        watching the tail lights recede.  It looks down.\n\n80I     ANGLE ON BLACKTOP, tight on the liquid metal blob.  Next to it is the\n        T-1000's shiny cop shoe.  The mercury blob crawls and rejoins the\n        main mass, disappearing into the \"shoe\".\n\n81      INT./EXT. SECURITY CAR\n\n        A GHOST CAR blasts out of the darkness on a long stretch of moonlight\n        highway.  Headlights off, the hospital security car punches a hole in\n        the wind.\n\n81A     INSIDE THE SPEEDING CAR the energy is still high.  The air is blowing\n        in the shattered windows as Terminator drives the car easily by\n        electronic night-vision.  His eyes glow faintly red.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Can you see anything?\n\n81B     TERMINATOR'S POV.  A monochrome image of the highway lit bright as\n        day.\n\n81C     Terminator replies in a matter-of-fact tone.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Everything.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Cool.\n\n        Sarah looks at Terminator, still not quite believing this is\n        happening.  But this is a different Sarah than the waitress of 1984.\n        She spends only a second or two dealing with the unbelievable.\n        Then she turns to John in the back seat.\n\n                                SARAH\n                You okay?\n\n        He nods.  She reaches for John and we think she's going to hug him.\n        She starts to rub her hands over him and we realize she's checking for\n        injuries, very clinically the way a vet checks a dog for broken bones.\n\n        He pulls away from her.  He hates her always checking him, treating\n        him like he might break, like some piece of rare china.\n\n                                JOHN\n                I said I was okay.\n\n        Sarah looks at him, exasperated and stern.\n\n                                SARAH\n                It was stupid of you to go there.\n\n        John stares at her, surprised.\n\n                                SARAH\n                Goddamnit, John, you have to be smarter than\n                that.  You're too important!  You can't risk\n                yourself, not even for me, do you understand?\n                I can take care of myself.  I was doing fine.\n                Jesus, John.  You almost got yourself killed.\n\n        We see his chin quiver.  He's a tough kid, but all he really wants is\n        for her to love him.

I'm\n                sorry, I...\n\n        His face crumples.  He starts to cry.  Sarah gives him a cold stare.\n\n                                SARAH\n                Stop it!  Right now!  You can't cry, John.\n                Other kids can afford to cry.  You can't.\n\n        He's trying to be brave, he really is.  Terminator turns and sees the\n        water leaking from his eyes.  It doesn't make and sense to him.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                What is wrong with your eyes?\n\n        John turns away, ashamed.  Sarah lets her breath out, realizing how\n        keyed up she is.  She turns to Terminator, giving him a wary once-\n        over.\n\n                                SARAH\n                So what's your story?\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n82      EXT. MENTAL HOSPITAL\n\n        The cops have shown up, as they always do.  There are black-and-whites\n        everywhere, and ambulances are arriving.  Two cops and an orderly are\n        required to subdue poor Doctor Silberman, who is raving at the top of\n        his lungs.\n\n                                SILBERMAN\n                ... it was all true and we're all going to die\n                and the changed, I saw him change!!\n\n        It's quite pathetic.\n        A nurse shoots him up with a sedative.  They lead him away.\n\n82A     T-1000 walks unperturbed among the milling cops.  No one notices him.\n        It slips into its cruiser and drives off into the night.\n\n83      INT. CAR\n\n        Terminator drives steadily into the black night.\n\n                                SARAH\n                This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a\n                few seconds.\n\n        Sarah thinks about that.  Then:\n\n                                SARAH\n                Can it be destroyed?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Unknown.\n\n        They ride along in silence for a few seconds.\n        Sarah sees something up ahead, some lonely neon in the blackness.\n\n                                SARAH\n                Pull in here.

SERVICE STATION - NIGHT\n\n        A rundown gas station with a buzzing neon sign and no one around.\n        They pull into the drive and slowly cruise past the empty office.  A\n        sign in the window says CLOSED SUNDAYS.  They continue around the\n        building to the garage's back door.\n\n        AT THE GARAGE DOOR.  Terminator breaks the lock on the roll-up door\n        and raises it.  Sarah pulls the security car in out of sight.\n        Terminator rolls the door down behind them.\n\n85      INT. GAS STATION\n\n        Dark.  Sarah switches on the single drop-light.  She and Terminator\n        look at each other.  Terminator is shot-up and bleeding, and Sarah\n        has a vicious slash in her upper arm which was soaked her sleeve with\n        blood.\n\n                                SARAH\n                You look like handmade shit.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                So do you.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n86      TIGHT ON FIRST-AID KIT from the office, plus some not-so-oily rags, a\n        bottle of rubbing alcohol, a few small tools, and other makeshift\n        odds and ends.  Terminator's hand comes into shot.  Sets down a bloody\n        rag.  Picks up a clean one.\n\n        WIDER.  Sarah sits on an empty crate.  Terminator's is beside her,\n        suturing her wound with some fine wire from the winding of an\n        alternator.  Using a pair of needlenose pliers he draws the wire\n        through her pale skin with a delicate hand.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                I have detailed files on human anatomy.\n\n        Sarah stares into his face, inches away, fighting the pain.  She\n        doesn't like him being this close to her to begin with, let alone\n        carving on her.\n\n                                SARAH\n                I'll bet. Makes you a more efficient killer,\n                right?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Correct.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n87      TIGHT ON TERMINATOR'S BACK.  The leather jacket is riddled with bullet\n        holes.  Sarah and John help pull it off, revealing Terminator's\n        broad, muscular back beneath.\n\n        WIDER.  John and Sarah stare in amazement.  There are at least twenty\n        bullet holes in him.  Back.  Arms.  Legs.  Fortunately they're all\n        9mm.  The holes are small and the damage cosmetic.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Does it hurt?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                I sense injuries.  The data could be called\n                pain.\n\n        TIGHT ON SARAH AND TERMINATOR.  Sarah starts washing the bullet holes\n        in his broad back with alcohol.\n\n                                SARAH\n                Will these heal up?\n\n        Terminator nods.  She reaches into the bloody wounds with pliers and\n        finds the copper-jacketed bullets, flattening against the armored\n        endoskeleton.  Pulls them out.  They CLINK one by one into a glass.\n\n                                SARAH\n                That's good.  Because if you can't pass for\n                human, you won't be much good to us.\n\n        She concentrates on removing the slugs.  CLINK.  CLINK.\n\n                                JOHN\n                How long do you live?  I mean, last?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                A hundred and twenty years on my existing\n                power cell.\n\n        Sarah nods, pulling out another slug.  CLINK.  The glass nearly full\n        of flattened bullets.  She begins to sew the holes closed with a few\n        wire sutures.  John watches in quiet amazement, the two warriors\n        calmly fixing each other.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Can you learn?  So you can be... you know.\n                More human.  Not such a dork all the time.\n\n        Terminator turns towards him.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning\n                computer.

OF AN X-ACTO KNIFE cutting into Terminator's scalp at the base\n        of his skull.  His voice calmly directs Sarah as she spreads the bloody\n        incision and locates the maintenance port for the CPU in the chrome\n        skull beneath.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Now open the port cover.\n\n        She wipes away the blood and uses the garage-mechanic's air tools to\n        unscrew the port cover.\n\n88A     TERMINATOR POV (DIGITIZED) as he watches her work in a mirror they've\n        taken from the washroom.  Sarah and John are standing behind him.\n        Her hands are covered with blood, like a surgeon's.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Hold the CPU by its base tab.  Pull.\n\n        Following the instructions, she reaches in with a pair of tweezers and\n        PULLS -- there is a BURST OF STATIC and the screen goes BLACK.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n89      TIGHT ON JOHN AND SARAH looking at what she has removed.  A reddish-\n        brown ceramic rectangle with a connector on one end.  About the size\n        and shape of a domino.  On close inspection it appears to be made up\n        of small cubes connected together.  It is identical to the shattered\n        one in the vault at Cyberdyne Systems.  Now we know it is that that\n        Miles Dyson values so highly.  The brain of a terminator.\n\n89A     WIDER.  John walks around Terminator and looks at his face.\n        Eyes open, he is completely inert.  Dead.\n\n        John lifts his huge hand.  The dead servos whine sullenly as he forces\n        them.  It's like rigor mortis.  He releases the hand and it stays in\n        the lifted position.  Sarah examines the CPU chip.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Can you see the pin switch?\n\n        She ignores him.  See looks at Terminator.\n        The back at the chip.\n        Then she sets it on the work table and picks up a small sledge hammer.\n        John realizes what she is about to do.  Dives at her as the sledge is\n        whistling down.\n\n                                JOHN\n                No!!!!\n\n        He slaps his hand down over the chip.\n        Sarah barely stops the sledge before smashing his fingers.\n\n                                SARAH\n                Out of the way, John!\n\n                                JOHN\n                No!

These things are hard to\n                kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never\n                have this opportunity again.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Look, Mom, if I'm supposed to ever be this great\n                leader, you should start listening to my\n                leadership ideas once in a while.  'Cause if you\n                won't, nobody else will.\n\n        Smart kid.  He's got her.  She nods, reluctantly.  He palms the chip\n        and studies it minutely.\n\n89B     John takes a pin and moves the almost invisible switch to the other\n        position.\n        It is now in \"write\" mode.  Then he grimaces as he inserts the wafer\n        back into the slot in Terminator's skull.\n\n89C     TERMINATOR VISION flares back to life in a burst of static.  The image\n        forms.  Sarah and John stands behind him in the mirror.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Was there a problem?\n\n        John glances sheepishly at Sarah,  Then smiles at Terminator.\n\n                                JOHN\n                No problem.  None whatsoever.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n90      JOHN SLEEPING, lying on a pile of rags next to a stack of tires.\n        The lights are off.  Sarah sits nearby, cross-legged, he back against\n        the wall.\n        The .45 is cradles in her lap.  She looks weary, but she won't allow\n        herself to sleep with Terminator present.\n\n        By the office windows, in a slash of moonlight, is Terminator.  He\n        stands silent and still, watching the night.  Only his eyes move,\n        tracking with the occasional car passing on the road.  He figure\n        silhouetted and still.\n\n                                                DISSOLVE TO:\n\n91      SAME IMAGE.  Now DAYLIGHT streams in the dusty windows.\n        Terminator has not moved.  Faithful machine sentinel.  He turns at a\n        sound.  John stirs, waking up.  He squints into the sunlight.  Sarah\n        is still awake.  She gets up, wincing at the pain in her arm.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n92      EXT. GAS STATION - DAY (LATER)\n\n        John and Terminator walks to an old Chevy pickup parked behind the\n        garage.  The day is clear but windy.  Dust devils chase themselves\n        behind the place.  The pickup is locked but Terminator breaks the side\n        window with his fist and opens the door.  He and John climb in.\n\n92A     IN THE PICKUP.  Terminator has this trick (which you could do too if\n        you had servo-driven steel fingers) where he smashes the cowl around\n        a steering column with one blow from the palm of his hand.  When it\n        shatters he strips it away with a single move, and then turns the stub\n        of the lock-mechanism with his fingertips.  This starts the vehicle.\n        It takes about three seconds.\n\n        In fact, he does it so quickly, the truck is running by the time John\n        flips down the sun visor.  A set of keys drops out and John catches\n        them.  Dangles them in front of Terminator's eyes.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Are we learning yet?\n\n92B     Sarah comes out.  She's found a mechanic's coverall inside, used but\n        fairly clean.  It doesn't fit her too well, but it's better than the\n        stuff from the hospital.  She's still barefoot.\n        The sun, which she hasn't seen in months, hurts her eyes,\n        Terminator and John pull up in the pickup.  She gets in.\n\n92C                             TERMINATOR\n                We need to get as far from the city as possible.\n\n                                SARAH\n                Just head south.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n93      INT./EXT.

They set three abreast on the bench seat, John\n        in between, like some improbable family on a car trip.\n        Sarah leans over to get a look at the speedometer.\n\n                                SARAH\n                Keep it under sixty-five.

Replays again in slow motion.\n        A vector-graphic of the lips smiling appears, along with an array of\n        symbolic data.\n\n        Terminator tries it.  The result is dismal.  A rictus-like curling of\n        the lip.  Terminator's next effort is a marginal improvement.\n\n                                JOHN\n                I don't know, maybe you could practice in front\n                of a mirror or something.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n98      EXT. REST STOP/PICKUP TRUCK - DAY (LATER)\n\n        Sarah and John are eating cheeseburgers and fries, sitting in the\n        truck and on the curb respectively.  They are parked away from the\n        other families, at the end of the gravel parking area.  Terminator\n        is pouring coolant into the radiator.  Sarah is deep in through,\n        turning and turning the whole thing in her brain.  John, unable to\n        deal with her silence, goes around to where Terminator is working.\n\n98A     John sees two kids playing with machine-gun water pistols nearby,\n        viciously squirting each other.\n\n                                FIRST KID\n                You're dead!\n\n                                SECOND KID\n                Am not!\n\n                                FIRST KID\n                Are so!\n\n        John and Terminator watch them rolling on the ground in a fight to the\n        death.  Sarah rounds the front of the truck, and sees the kids.  John\n        sighs, solemn.

He is deep in\n        thought, tapping away at the keyboard of his home computer terminal.\n        Next to desk are racks of sophisticated gear.  On a Sunday morning,\n        when most men are relaxing, spending time with their families, Dyson\n        is hard at work.\n\n        IN A PROFILE CLOSEUP we see him in deep concentration, his mind\n        prowling the labyrinth of his new microprocessor.\n\n        A WOMAN'S FACE ENTERS FRAME soundlessly behind him.  He doesn't hear\n        her.  His wife, TARISSA, extends her tongue and traces it down the\n        back of his neck.  He smiles and turns to kiss her good morning.\n        She's still in her bathrobe, holding coffee.  He's been up for hours.\n        He turns and goes back to work, forgetting instantly that she is\n        standing there.\n\n        She watches him work, the arcane symbols moving across the screen.\n        We see her frustration, her inability to truly enter the magic box\n        of his world.\n\n                                TARISSA\n                You going to work all day?\n\n                                DYSON\n                I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my\n                ass.  I thought we had it with this one...\n\n        He points to a metal box on his desk, about two feet long.  As\n        assembly of small cubes.  It looks like a dinosaur version of\n        Terminator's CPU.\n\n                                DYSON\n                ... but the output went to shit after three\n                seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm\n                matrixing the command hierarchies...\n\n                                TARISSA\n                You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you\n                come back.\n\n                                DYSON\n                I can't\n\n                                TARISSA\n                Miles, it's Sunday.

I'm on a roll here.\n\n        He takes her hands.  We see a childlike excitement in his face.  He\n        wants so badly to share the almost orgasmic thrill of discovery,\n        the satisfaction of creation.\n\n                                DYSON\n                Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away.\n                It's a neural-net process --\n\n                                TARISSA\n                I know.  You told me.  It's a neural-net\n                processor.  It thinks and learns like we do.\n                It's superconducting at room temperature.\n                Other computer are pocket calculators by\n                comparison.\n                        (she pulls away from him)\n                But why is that so goddamn important, Miles?\n                I really need to know, 'cause I feel like I'm\n                going crazy here, sometimes.\n\n                                DYSON\n                I'm sorry, honey, it's just that I'm thiiis\n                close.\n\n        He holds up his thumb and index finger... a fraction of an inch apart.\n        She picks up the prototype.  It doesn't look like much.\n\n                                DYSON\n                Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes\n                a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to\n                work with a hangover.\n                        (he taps the prototype)\n                Meet the pilot.\n\n                                TARISSA\n                Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have\n                these two children?  You don't need us.  Your\n                heart and your mind are in here.\n                        (she stares at the metal box\n                        in her hands)\n                But it doesn't love you like we do.\n\n        He takes the anodized box from her hands and sets it down.  Then he\n        puts his hands on her shoulders and kisses her gently.  She acquiesces\n        to his kiss.\n\n                                DYSON\n                I'm sorry.\n\n        Tarissa glances over his shoulder.  She nods her head toward the\n        doorway to the study.  Dyson turns and sees their two kids standing\n        there.  Danny (6) and Blythe (4) look rumpled and adorable in their\n        PJs.  Dyson wilts at their hopeful expressions.\n\n                                TARISSA\n                How about spending some time with your other\n                babies?\n\n        Dyson grins. The forces of darkness have lost this round.  He holds\n        out his hands and his kids run to him, cheering.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\nA100    EXT.

John hits the throttle and the Cat churns its treads,\n        pulling some massive load.  A six-by-eight foot sheet of steel plate\n        moves slowly under six inches of sand.\n\n        John drags it far enough to reveal... a rectangular hole in the\n        ground.

At the far end, boxes\n        containing ammo, grenades, etc. are stacked to the ceiling.\n        Terminator gets real alert.  Scanning, wondering where to begin.

The Terminator would never stop, it\n                would never leave him... it would always be\n                there.  And it would never hurt him, never shout\n                at him or get drunk and hit him, or say it\n                couldn't spend time with him because it was too\n                busy.

Nothing stirs around the cruiser except some\n        pump-jacks sucking the earth on the hill behind it.\n\nA111    IN THE CRUISER.  The T-1000 sits inside.  John's notes and letters are\n        spread out on the seat beside it.  Sarah's voice speaks from a\n        cassette deck.  John's tapes.

The big KAWASAKI 1100 idles\n        up next to the T-1000, still seated in the cruiser.\n\n                                BIKE COP\n                Howdy.

The weapons are cleaned and her work\n        is done.  She hasn't slept in twenty-four hours and she seems to have\n        the weight of the whole world on her shoulder.\n        She draws her knife from its belt sheath.\n        Idly starts to carve something on the table top... the letter \"N\".\n\nA114    NOT FAR AWAY, John and Terminator are packing the Bronco for the trip.\n\nA115    ON SARAH, AT THE TABLE as she looks up from her carving, thinking.\n        She watches Salceda's kids playing nearby... wrestling with a mutty\n        dog and loving it.  Sarah watches Yolanda walking her toddler by her\n        hands.  Backlit, stylized.  She looks over at John.  Loading guns and\n        supplies.\n\nA116    ANGLE ON kids playing.\n\nA117    SARAH'S HEAD droops.  She closes her eyes.\n\nA118    TIGHT ON small children playing.  Different ones.\n        Wider now, to reveal a playground in a park.  Very idyllic.  A dream\n        playground, crowded with laughing children playing on swings, slides,\n        and a jungle gym.  It could be the playground we saw melted and frozen\n        in the post-nuclear desolation of 2029.  But here the grass is vibrant\n        green and the sun is shining.\n\n118A    Sarah, short-haired, looking drab and paramilitary, stands outside the\n        playground.  An outsider.  Her fingers are hooked in a chain-link\n        fence and she is staring through the fence at the young mothers\n        playing with their kids.  A grim-faced harbinger.\n\n118B    Some girls play skip-rope.  Their sing-song weaves through the random\n        burbling laughter of the kids.  One of the young mothers walks her\n        two-year-old son by the hands.  She is wearing a pink waitress\n        uniform.  She turns to us, laughing.\n        It is Sarah.  Beautiful.  Radiant.  Sarah from another life,\n        uncontaminated by the dark future.  She glances at the strange woman\n        beyond the fence.\n\n118C    Grim-faced Sarah presses against the fence.  She starts shouting at\n        them in SLOW MOTION.  No sound comes from her mouth.  She grabs the\n        fence in frustration, shaking it.  Screaming soundlessly.\n        Waitress Sarah's smile falls.  Then returns as her little boy throws\n        some sand at her.  She laughs, turns away, as if the woman at the\n        fence were a shadow, a trick of light.\n\n118D-118F  OMITTED\n\n118G    THE SKY EXPLODES.  The children ignite like match heads.  Sarah is\n        burning, screaming silently, everything silent and overexposed.\n\n118H    THE BLAST WAVE HITS... devouring the cowering mothers and children.\n        Sarah's scream merges with the howl of the wind as the shockwave rips\n        into her, blasting her apart and she...\n\n119     Wakes up.\n        All is quiet and normal.  The children are still playing nearby.  Less\n        than fifteen minutes have gone by.\n\n        Bathed in sweat, Sarah sits hunched over the table.\n        Every muscle is shaking.  She is gasping.\n        Sarah struggles to breathe, running her hand through her hair which is\n        soaked with sweat,  She can escape from the hospital, but she can't\n        escape from the madness which haunts her.\n\n        She looks down at the words she has carved on the table, amid the\n        scrawled hearts and bird-droppings.  They are:  \"NO FATE.\"\n        Something changes in her eyes.  She slams her knife down in the table\n        top, embedding it deeply in the words.

Lots of glass.  Dyson's study\n        is lit bluish with the glow of his computer monitors.  He is at the\n        terminal, working.  Where else?  We see him clearly in a long shot\n        from an embankment behind the house.\n\n        A DARK FIGURE moves into the foreground.  Rack focus to Sarah as she\n        turns into profile.  She raises the CAR-15 rifle and begins screwing\n        the long heavy cylinder of a sound-suppresser onto the end of the\n        barrel.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\nA125-A125K  OMITTED\n\n129     OMITTED\n\n129A    INT. DYSON HOUSE\n\n        Dyson's kids, Danny and Blythe, are playing in the halls with a radio-\n        controlled off-road truck.  Danny drives and Blythe scampers after it,\n        trying to catch it.  They stop in the hall outside Dyson's study and\n        sees him working at his terminal.  Danny puts a finger to his lips,\n        shushing Blythe.  His expression is mischievous.\n\n129B    With the silencer in place, Sarah eases back the bolt and then slips\n        it forward, chambering a .223 round.  Then she lies down on the\n        embankment.\n        He cheek pressed against the cool rifle-stock, she slides one hand\n        slowly forward to brace the weapon, taking the weight on her elbow.\n        Her other hand slips knowingly to the trigger.\n\n        Her expression is cold, impassive.  She looks through the scope at the\n        man in the house.  She feels nothing as she raises the rifle.\n\n130     OMITTED\n\n130A    INT. DYSON'S HOUSE\n\n        DYSON, in deep thought.  The rhythmic sounds of keys as he works.\n        Symbols on the screen shift.\n\n        ON HIS BACK we see the glowing red dot appear.  It is the target dot\n        of Sarah's laser designator.  It moves silently up his back toward\n        his head.\n\n131     EXT. DYSON HOUSE/EMBANKMENT\n\n        IN EXTREME CLOSEUP we see Sarah's eye at the night-scope.\n        TIGHT INSERT on her finger as it tightens on the trigger, taking out\n        the slack.  She takes a deep breath and holds it.  Adjusts her\n        position minutely.\n\n132     INT. DYSON HOUSE\n\n        The laser dot jiggles on the back of Dyson's neck and then rises,\n        centering on the back of his skull.\n\n132A    LOW ANGLE as Danny's Bigfoot truck roars toward us -- FILLING FRAME.\n        Thump.  It hits Dyson's foot.  He jerks, startled, and looks down\n        as --\n        POP!!\n132B    His monitor screen is BLOWN OUT spraying his with glass.  He jerks\n        back, utterly shocked... and spins to see the huge hole blown through\n        the window behind him.  This saves him as K-THUMP! -- the second shot\n        blows the top of his high-backed chain into an explosion of stuffing\n        an inch from his head.\n        Instinctively he dives to the carpet as --\n\n        BLAM BLAM BLAM -- rounds blast through the window, tearing into his\n        desk and computer, blowing his keyboard into shrapnel.\n132C    With the monitor screen blown out, the room is in darkness.  Sarah\n        can't see Dyson now, down behind his desk.  She puts round after round\n        into the heavy desk, blasting one side of it into kindling.\n\n132D    Dyson, scared out of his mind, has his face jammed against the carpet,\n        terrified to move.  He sees his kids in the hall.\n\n                                DYSON\n                Run, kids!  Go!  Run!\n\n132E    IN THE HALL, TARISSA rounds the corner at a dead run.  She sees the\n        kids running toward her and grabs them in her arms.  Down the hall,\n        in the dark study, she sees Dyson on the floor amid the splinters and\n        shrapnel of the continuing fusillade.\n\n                                TARISSA\n                Miles!  Oh my God!!\n\n                                MILES\n                Stay back!!\n\n132F    ON THE FLOOR, Dyson flinches as chucks of wood and shattered computer\n        components shower down on him.  He looks desperately toward the door,\n        but knows he'd be totally exposed.  He'd never make it.\n\n133     SARAH's rifle empties with a final CLACK!\n        She throws it down and draws her .45 smoothly from a shoulder base.\n        She starts toward the house, snapping back the slide on the pistol,\n        chambering a round.  She is in a fast, purposeful walk, keeping her\n        eyes fixed on the target.  She is utterly determined to kill this man.\n\n134     FROM UNDER THE DESK Dyson can see a sliver in the backyard.  He sees\n        Sarah's feet as she strides toward him.  He tenses to make a break for\n        the door.\n\n        Sarah raises the pistol, eyes riveted ahead, controlling her\n        breathing.  Dyson springs up in a full-tilt sprint.  She tracks him.\n        He hooks a foot on the cord of a toppled disk drive.\n        BOOM!  Her shot blows apart a lamp where his head was.\n        He hits the floor hard, but keeps moving, scrambling forward.\n\n        Crunch of glass behind his as Sarah's dark form is framed in the\n        blown-out floor-to-ceiling window.  Dyson leaps toward the hall.\n        BOOM!  Her second shot spins him.  He hits the floor in the hallway.\n        Tarissa is screaming.  Dyson struggles forward, stunned.  There is a\n        .45-caliber hole clean through his left shoulder.  He smears the wall\n        with blood as he staggers up.  Looking back, he sees the implacable\n        figure behind him, coming on.\n\n        He topples through a doorway as --\n        BOOM!  BOOM!  Shots blowing away the molding where he just was.\n\n135     EXT. DYSON HOUSE/STREET\n\n        Terminator and John leap from the jeep, sprinting toward the house.\n        The shots sound muffles from outside.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Shit, we're too late!\n\n136     INT. HOUSE\n\n        Advancing with Sarah we enter the living area.  Tarissa has Blythe and\n        she's screaming at Danny, who has run back to his collapsed father.\n\n                                TARISSA\n                Danny!  DANNY!\n\n                                DANNY\n                Daaaaddddeeee!\n\n        Danny is pulling at Dyson, crying and screaming, as his father tries\n        to stagger forward.  Tarissa drops Blythe and runs back for Dyson,\n        grabbing him.  Sarah looms behind them with the pistol aimed.\n\n                                SARAH\n                Don't fucking move!  Don't FUCKING MOVE!!\n                        (she swings the gun on\n                        Tarissa)\n                Get on the floor, bitch!  Now!!  Fucking down!\n                NOW!!\n\n        Sarah is crazy-eyed now, shaking with the intensity of the moment.\n        The kill has gone bad, with screaming kids and the wife involved...\n        things she never figured on.  Tarissa drops to the knees, terrified\n        as she looks into the muzzle of the gun.  Blythe runs to Dyson and\n        hugs him, wailing.\n\n                                BLYTHE\n                Don't hurt my father!\n\n                                SARAH\n                        (screaming)\n                Shut up, kid!  Get out of the way!!\n\n        Dyson looks up, through his pain and incomprehension.  Why is this\n        nightmare happening?  The black gun muzzle is a foot from his face.\n\n                                DYSON\n                        (gasping)\n                Please... let... the kids... go...\n\n                                SARAH\n                Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all\n                your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!\n\n        We see her psyching herself to pull the trigger... needing now to hate\n        this man she doesn't know.  It's a lot harder face-to-face.  She is\n        bathed in sweat, and it runs into her eyes.  Blinking, she wipes it\n        fast with one hand, then gets it back on the gun.  The .45 is\n        trembling.\n\n        TIGHT ON SARAH as we see the forces at war behind her eyes.\n        She looks into the faces of Dyson, Tarissa, Blythe, Danny.\n        Sarah takes a sharp breath and all the muscles in her arms contract\n        as she tenses to fire.\n        But her finger won't do it.\n        She lowers the gun very slowly.  It drops to her side in one hand.\n\n        All the breath and energy seems to go out of her.\n        She weakly raises her other hand in a strange gesture, like \"Stay\n        where you are, don't move\".  As if, should they move, the fragile\n        balance might tip back the other way.\n        She backs away from them slowly, panting.  It's as if she's backing\n        away in terror from what she almost did.  She reaches a wall and\n        slumps against it.  Slides down to her knees.  The gun falls limply\n        from her fingers.\n        She rests her cheek against the wall.\n\n136A    The front door is kicked in.\n        Terminator steps inside.  John grabs his sleeve and pushes past him.\n        He scopes out the situation in two seconds... Sarah, the gun, the\n        sobbing family.  John moves to Sarah while Terminator checks Dyson.\n\n        John kneels in front of his mother.  She raises her head to look at\n        him.  He sees the tears spilling down her cheeks,\n\n                                JOHN\n                Mom?  You okay?\n\n                                SARAH\n                I couldn't... oh, God.\n                        (she seems to she him for\n                        the first time)\n                You... came here... to stop me?\n\n                                JOHN\n                Uh huh.\n\n        She reaches out and takes his shoulder suddenly, surprising him...\n        drawing him to her.  She hugs him and a great sob wells up deep inside\n        her, from a spring she had thought long dry.  She hugs him fiercely\n        as the sobs wrack her.\n\n        John clutches her shoulders.  It is all he ever wanted.\n\n                                JOHN\n                It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it\n                out.\n\n                                SARAH\n                I love you, John.  I always have.\n\n                                JOHN\n                I know, Mom.  I know.\n\n        TARISSA looks around at the bizarre tableau.  Terminator has\n        wordlessly ripped open Dyson's shirt and examined the wound.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Clean penetration.  No shattered bone.\n                Compression should control the loss of blood.\n\n        He takes Tarissa's hands and presses them firmly over the entrance and\n        exit wounds.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Do you have bandages?\n\n                                DYSON\n                In the bathroom.  Danny, can you get them for\n                us?\n\n        Danny nods and runs down the hall.\n        John disengages from Sarah.  She wipes her tears, the instinct to\n        toughen up taking over again.  But the healing moment has had its\n        effect, nevertheless.\n\n        John walks toward Dyson and Terminator.\n\n                                DYSON\n                Who are you people?\n\n\n        John draws the Biker's knife from Terminator's boot.  Hands it to him.\n\n\n                                JOHN\n                Show him.\n\n        Terminator takes off his jacket to reveal bare arms.\n        John takes Blythe by the hands and leads her down the hall, away\n        from what is about to happen.\n\n136B    TIGHT ON TERMINATOR'S left forearm as the knife makes a deep cut just\n        below the elbow.  In one smooth motion, Terminator cuts all the way\n        around his arm.  With a second cut, he splits the skin of the forearm\n        from elbow to wrist.\n\n        TERMINATOR grasps the skin and strips is off his forearm like a\n        surgeon rips off a rubber glove.  It comes off with a sucking rip,\n        leaving a bloody skeleton.\n\n        But the skeleton is made of bright metal, and is laced with hydraulic\n        actuators.  The fingers are as finely crafted as watch parts... they\n        flex into a fist and extend.  Terminator holds it up, palm out, in\n        almost the exact position of the one in the vault at Cyberdyne,\n\n        HOLD ON DYSON reacting to the servo-hand in front of him.\n        He's seen one of these before.\n        Tarissa is screaming now, but he doesn't hear her.\n\n                                DYSON\n                My God.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Now listen to me very carefully.\n\n137     INT. HOUSE/KITCHEN - LATER\n\n        Sarah puts out her fifth cigarette.  She's sitting on the counter.\n        John, Terminator, Dyson, and Tarissa are at the kitchen table, under\n        a single overhead light.\n\n        Dyson looks like that guy on the Sistine Chapel wall, the damned\n        soul... eyes fixed and staring with terrifying knowledge.  His\n        shoulder is bandaged.  Terminator's arm is wrapped with a blood-soaked\n        bandage below the elbow.  The steel forearm and hand gleam in the\n        harsh kitchen light.  TRACKING AROUND THE TABLE as Terminator\n        speaks... we don't hear the words.\n\n                                SARAH (V.O.)\n                Dyson listened while the Terminator laid it all\n                down.  Skynet.  Judgment Day... the history of\n                things to come.

In a frontal angle, the others block\n        Terminator from view.\n\n        THE GUARD at the front desk, GIBBONS, looks up as Dyson moves toward\n        him.  Dyson is pale and sweaty, but smiles warmly at the guard,\n        speaking well before he reaches the desk.\n\n                                DYSON\n                Evening, Paul.

Millions in hardware, and all irreplaceable\n        fruits of their years of research... shattered, broken, dumped in a\n        heap for the big bonfire of destiny.\n        Dyson stops a second, panting.\n\n                                DYSON\n                Give me that thing a second.\n\n        Terminator hands him the axe.  Dyson hefts it one-handed.  He turns to\n        a lab table... on it is another prototype processor.\n\n                                DYSON\n                I've worked for years on this thing.\n\n        Swinging awkwardly but with great force he smashes the axe down onto\n        the processor prototype, exploding it into fragments.  His shoulder is\n        agony, but he looks satisfied.\n\n149     INT. SECOND FLOOR SECURITY STATION\n\n        John taps away at his little lap-top, which is running code\n        combinations into the card-key lock.  Suddenly, the green light on \n        the lock goes on and it unlocks with a clunk.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Easy money.\n\n        He whips it open, revealing a rack of keys.  But the VAULT-KEY is\n        distinctive, a long steel rectangle on a neck-chain.  John grabs it\n        and runs toward the lab.\n\n150     INT. LAB\n\n        Sarah and Terminator are working like a crack team, rigging the\n        explosives.  She is taping the claymores to the gas cans with duct\n        tape to create powerful incendiary bombs.  Terminator is attaching\n        claymores and blocks of C-4 plastic explosive to the large MAINFRAME\n        COMPUTER cabinets nearby.  All the claymores are wired back to one\n        detonator with has a RADIO-CONTROL RELAY switch.\n\n                                DYSON\n                How do you set them off?\n\n        Terminator shows him a REMOTE DETONATOR, a small transmitter with a\n        red plunger.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Radio remote.\n\n        He makes a plunger-pushing motion with his thumb and an accompanying\n        \"click\" sound.

Behind them an ugly BLACK SWAT VAN\n        screeches into the lot.\n\n153A    We hear the THUMP OF ROTORS as a POLICE CHOPPER arrives and swings in\n        close to the building.  It rakes its XENON SPOTLIGHT through the\n        second floor offices.\n\n154     INT./EXT. SECOND FLOOR OFFICE\n\n        Terminator crosses the office toward the floor-to-ceiling windows.\n        He is outlines starkly by the spotlight as it rakes through the dark\n        offices.  Without breaking stride he kicks an executive desk toward\n        the window.\n154A    Glass explodes outward and the desk topples, falling to the sidewalk\n        below.\n\n154B    Terminator, standing at the edge, FIRES A LONG BURST with strafes the\n        police cars lines up below.  Cops duck as glass flies.  Terminator,\n        with his superb aim, hits no one.  But noticed is served.\n\n154C    The cops (surprise) FIRE BACK.  Terminator turns and is walking\n        calmly from the window as glass, office furniture, drapes etc. are\n        riddled by return fire.  A few rounds hit his back, but he doesn't\n        notice.  He reloads as he walks.\n\n155     INT.

The vault grumbles to\n        itself, withdrawing it locking bolts with a final KLONK!\n        Together Dyson and John swing the door open.\n\n156     EXT./INT. LOBBY\n\n        The varsity takes the field as the SWAT TROOPERS sprint forward by\n        squads.  They flank the lobby and work their way inside, deploying\n        rapidly.  They move and freeze, behind cover, quivering with\n        adrenaline.  They have all that great SWAT equipment:  body armor,\n        gas-masks, M-16s, tear-gas launchers, ropes.  The works.  They make\n        a lot of hand signals and keep their mouths shut.  They're well-\n        trained and deadly.\n\n157     OUTSIDE we see cops firing TEAR GAS grenades through the broken\n        windows into second-floor offices.\n\n158     INT. VAULT\n\n        John and Dyson are isolated from the world in this silent steel womb.\n        Dyson opens the cabinet containing the terminator relics.  It's John\n        turn to stare with uneasy deja-vu as he sees the terminator hand and\n        CPU.\n\n        Then in one vicious move he sweeps his arm behind the inert-gas flasks\n        and hurls them to the floor.  They SHATTER.  John snatches the CPU\n        and the metal hand out of the broken glass.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Got ol' Skynet by the ball now, Miles.

FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR/STAIRWELL\n\n        We see the advance squad of SWATs make it to one of the stairwells.\n        They start up, two at a time, covering each other ritualistically by\n        the numbers.\n\n160     INT. LAB/HALL\n\n        John pelts into the lab with Dyson stumbling along behind him.\n        Sarah is just finished wiring all the charges to the central\n        detonator.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Ready to rock?\n\n                                SARAH\n                Ready.\n\n        John tosses her the metal hand.  She catches it and bends to put the\n        hand in her empty back-pack.  Sarah zips the pack and starts to shuck\n        into it.\n\n        Dyson's running out of steam.  The bandages at his shoulder are soaked\n        with seeping blood.  He stands in the middle of the lab, saying\n        goodbye in his mind, looking weak and empty.\n        Terminator strides into the lab.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Time to go.  Right now.\n\n        He and John head back the way they came, through security.\n        Sarah sees that in her work, she has set the detonator down twenty\n        feet away, near where Dyson is standing.\n\n                                SARAH\n                Dyson, hand me the detonator.  Let's go --\n\n        He gingerly picks up the detonator.  Starts toward her.  Then --\n160A    CRASH!!  THE DOORS AT THE BACK END OF THE LAB ARE KICKED OPEN.\n        SWAT LEADER  and two others OPEN FIRE.\n        Their M-16s rake the room.  Sarah dives behind a computer cabinet.\n        Dyson is HIT.  He is slammed to the floor by the impacts.\n\n161     IN THE HALL, John hears the firing and spins to run back.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Mommm!!!\n\n        Terminator grabs him as bullets slam into his broad back.  He makes\n        it around the corner with John, out of the line of fire.\n\n162     IN THE LAB, bullets rake over Sarah's head, smacking all around her,\n        clanging into the machine protecting her.  She can see Dyson, slumped\n        on the floor.  Debris and flying glass rain on her as the SWATs pour\n        on the fire.  The detonator is clutched in his hand.  He rolls to face\n        her, his eyes bulging from the pain of his torn-up guts.\n\n                                DYSON\n                Go.\n\n162A    Sarah hesitates a split second.  Then she snap-rolls and fast-crawls\n        through broken glass and debris into the hall where --\n\n        TERMINATOR grabs her by the jacket and hauls her roughly to her feet.\n        Bullets rake the walls behind them as they sprint forward.  They\n        round the corner.  John does a fast take that she's not hit and they\n        run together through the security checkpoint.\n\n163     INT. SECURITY STATION/CORRIDOR\n\n        John reaches the first door, and tries it.  Locked.\n        Terminator unslings the M-79 blooper smoothly, opening the breach.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Get back.\n\n        He pulls a grenade from the bandolier over his shoulder, and slides\n        it into the bore.  Flick his wrist.  The breech snaps shut.  Sarah\n        and John have a split second to duck and cover.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Cover you ears and open you mouth.\n\n163A    They do.  KABOOM!!! Twenty feet away the door, and half the wall\n        around it, EXPLODES outward.  The backblast hits Terminator full\n        force, but he strides through the smoking hole before the debris has\n        even hit the floor.\n\n164     OMITTED\n\n165     INT. LAB\n\n        SWAT LEADER moves cautiously through the lab.  Cat-stepping, he\n        circles around a desk which block Dyson's body from his view.  His\n        M-16 is leveled crisply.  We look over his shoulder as he rounds the\n        desk, revealing --\n\n        MILES DYSON is not dead.  He will be very soon, but at this moment he\n        is conscious.  He has propped himself up against the desk, and holds a\n        BOOK in one hand.  A heavy technical manual.\n\n        Below the book is the detonator, upright on the tile floor.\n        The message is clear.  \"Shoot me, the book drops on the plunger.\n        Adios.\"  Dyson wheezes, trying to draw enough breath to talk.\n\n                                DYSON\n                I don't know... how much longer...

His eyes, visible through his gas-\n        mask, go very wide.\n        He spins and motions his squad back.\n\n                                LEADER\n                Fall back!!  Everybody out!

Sarah and\n        John are coughing and stumbling in the choking darkness, buddy-\n        breathing with the single mask.  The doors open.  They get in the\n        elevator and head down.\n\n167     INT. LAB\n\n        Dyson is lying amid the ruins of his dreams.  Sprawled on the floor,\n        he has his back propped up against the desk.  He is bathed in his own\n        blood, which runs out in long fingers across the tiles.  His breathing\n        is shallow and raspy.  He still holds the book, trembling, above the\n        switch.\n\n        In his lap is the picture from his desk.  He has pulled it from the\n        debris next to him.  A tear trickles from his eye.  His wife and\n        children smile up at him through broken glass.\n\n168     OMITTED\n\n169     CUT TO THE PUPIL OF HIS EYE, at the moment of death, the instant the\n        light fade from his eyes and he is gone --\n        His arm drops and the book his the switch --\n\n170     EXT. BUILDING\n\n        As the face of the building EXPLODES in an eruption of glass and fire.\n        Remains of the second-floor windows shower the parking lot and a huge\n        fireball rolls out, leaping into the sky.\n        The cops look up, stunned.  The helicopter banks away from the heat.\n        Burning debris falls among the cop cars and a number of officers \n        break ranks, pulling back.\n\n171     ONLY ONE OF THEM seems to be moving with purpose.  A BIKE COP who has\n        just arrived drives through the disorganized crowd, directly toward\n        the building.\n\n171A    T-1000 guns the bike up a ramp to a pedestrian bridge which crosses\n        from a parking structure to the Cyberdyne building.

GROUND FLOOR/ELEVATOR/LOBBY\n\n        The elevator doors part and Terminator eases a look out into the\n        corridor.  The walls on either side of him ERUPT WITH BULLET HITS.\n        The SWATs have the lobby end of the corridor blocked off.  They're\n        totally trapped, cut off and screwed.\n\n                                JOHN\n                        (to Sarah)\n                Don't forget.  It's always darkness right\n                before... you're totally fucked.\n\n173A    The SWATs fire a tear-gas grenade toward the elevators.  It spews the\n        vicious CS gas out in a swirling cloud which envelops Sarah and John,\n        who are pressed against the back wall of the elevator.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Keep your eyes closed.  Don't move.\n                        (they nod, eyes squeezed shut)\n                I'll be back.\n\n        He slings the grenade launcher over his shoulder and walks out into\n        the corridor.\n\n173B    BLAM.  A tear-gas grenade ricochets from wall to wall as it flies down\n        the corridor.  It skids to rest in front of Terminator, throwing out\n        a white cloud which quickly fills the corridor.\n173C    In the elevator, Sarah and John are choking, handing the breathing\n        mask back and forth desperately.  They're scarred.  This looks like\n        it.\n173D    ANGLE ON THE SWAT TEAM, gripping their weapons at the mouth of the\n        corridor.  They watch the boiling cloud, waiting.\n\n173E    THEIR POV -- on the wall of boiling smoke.  A FIGURE APPEARS.  Walking\n        Totally unaffected.  Terminator emerges from the smoke.  Not even\n        misty-eyed.  Not what they expected.\n\n                                LEADER\n                        (through megaphone)\n                Stop where you are.  Lie down on the floor,\n                face down.  Down on floor, now!\n\n        He continues to stride toward them.\n        The SWATs tense up.  They've never seen anything like this.  They're\n        not sure what to do.  Closer and closer.\n\n                                LEADER\n                Drop him.\n\n        They OPEN FIRE.  The corridor is filled with CRACKING THUNDER.  The\n        rounds tear into Terminator's chest.  Stomach.  Face.  Thighs.  His\n        leather jacket leaps and jerks as the rounds hit him.  The SWATs\n        think the guy's wearing body armor or something.  They keep firing.\n        The rounds tear into him, staggering him slightly, but he keeps\n        moving.\n\n                                LEADER\n                You're not hitting him!\n\n                                SWAT #1\n                        (getting scared)\n                Yes I am!\n\n        Terminator draws his .45 smoothly.  Unhurried.  He shoots the nearest\n        man in the left thigh.  As he screams and drops, Terminator shoots\n        him in the right thigh.  Terminator bends down and picks up the \n        shrieking man's weapon... the TEAR-GAS LAUNCHER.\n\n        It is one of those new rotary jobs that hold 12 rounds in a big drum.\n        Terminator shoots the next SWAT in the chest with the tear-gas\n        launcher.  The gas canister hits the guy's body armor and doesn't\n        penetrate.  But it's like getting slugged in the stomach with a full-\n        swing from a baseball bat.  The SWAT fold double and hits the tiles,\n        gasping.\n\n        Terminator is an image from Hell, a tall figure in shredded black\n        leather, streaked with blood.  One eye is a bloody socket, the metal\n        eye-servo glistening.  The flesh of one cheek hangs down in tatters,\n        revealing the chrome cheekbone beneath.  The whole front of his \n        jacket is blown open, revealing his metal armor chest.\n\n        The remaining SWATs start to fall back.  One turns to run and --\n        KPOW!  A gas canister nail him in the back, sending him sprawling.\n\n173F    Terminator fires three gas canisters into the lobby.  It fills\n        rapidly with the white gas, cutting the visibility to a few feet.  It\n        is total pandemonium.  SWAT LEADER crouches in the fog, white-\n        knuckling the rifle.  Terminator looms suddenly out of the mist right\n        in front of him.  POOM!  Terminator drills him in the leg with the\n        .45.  As the guy screams and drops rifle to clutch his leg, Terminator\n        rips his gas mask off.  The SWAT leader drops writhing to the floor,\n        choking and gagging, clutching his bleeding thigh.\n\n        Terminator walks up to two SWATs at the front doors.  POW-POW.  Leg\n        and leg.  He snatches their masks as they fall.  The gunfire has\n        stopped.  Nobody an see anything.  Screams and whimpers echo in the\n        smoke.\n\n174     EXT. BUILDING\n\n        Smoke boils out of the front door as a figure emerges.  Firing the\n        tear-gas launcher with one hand, Terminator launches all remaining\n        rounds among the cop vehicles.  Unprotected officers run, choking\n        and half-blind, slamming into cars and tripping over each other.  It\n        is a total rout.\n\n175     AT THE SWAT VAN on of the SWATs is rapidly handing out the remaining\n        masks to unprotected cops.  A FIGURE appears out of the smoke beside\n        him.  He looks up.  His mask is ripped off and he is handed the empty\n        launcher.  Instinctively he catches it.  Terminator grabs his flak\n        vest with one hand and sails him out into the mist.\n\n175A    INT. SWAT VAN\n\n        Terminator strides the length of the van and climbs into the driver's\n        seat.  No keys in the ignition.  He flips down the sun visor.  The\n        keys fall into his hand.  He starts the van and slams it into gear.\n\n176     INT./EXT. LOBBY\n\n        The tear gas has cleared to a thin haze.  The uninjured SWATs are\n        tending their wounded.  They look up at the sound of shouts and a\n        roaring engine.\n\n176A    THE SWAT VAN CRASHES INTO THE LOBBY in an explosion of glass and\n        debris.  Cops scatter as the van screeches across the lobby in a \n        smoking one-eighty, sliding to a stop across the corridor which leads\n        to the bank of elevators.  Terminator backs up until -- crunch -- he\n        seals the corridor with the back of the van.\n\n176B    Sarah and John stumble along the corridor, coughing.\n        They leap into the back of the van and Terminator hits the throttle.\n        The van roars across the lobby and exits through blown-out windows.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n177     INT./EXT SECOND FLOOR\n\n        T-1000, astride the Kawasaki, looks down from a second-floor office\n        and sees the van tearing across the parking lot with the remaining\n        cops firing at it.  It knows.  It looks around.  Analyzing options.\n        It sees the helicopter hovering outside the building at the end of\n        this corner office block...\n        It twists full throttle on the powerful bike.\n        Roars through the office, accelerating fast, straight at the\n        windows --\n\n178     T-1000 BLASTS OUT THROUGH THE GLASS, airborne on the motorcycle.  It\n        rockets across the gap to the hovering chopper and --\n178A    SLAMS into the canopy.  The impact of bike and rider pitches the\n        chopper radically.  The startled PILOT fights to regain control as the\n        bike tumbles to the pavement below.\n178B    The T-1000 doesn't.  It clings to the shattered canopy.\n        Nightmarishly, the pilot watches as the T-1000 smashes its head\n        through the plexiglass canopy and rapidly POURS ITSELF through the\n        jagged hole.  It reforms instantly into its previous self on the\n        passenger seat.\n\n178C    It hurls the pilot out of the chopper and slides into the driver's\n        seat.\n        The chopper is auto-rotating, spinning out of control.  It drops\n        toward the parking lot.  T-1000 recovers control ten feet above the\n        ground.\n\n178D    Cops hits the deck as the tail-boom swings around, going over them by\n        inches.\n        The chopper lifts out in a power climb, roaring away across the\n        parking lot toward the fleeing SWAT van.\n\n        OKAY, BUCKLE YOUR SEATBELTS, HERE IT COMES...\n\n179     INT./EXT. SWAT VAN/HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n\n        Terminator looks back at his two passengers as he turns the boxy van\n        onto a divided highway.  Sarah and John are catching their breath,\n        still coughing from the CS gas.  Terminator look to the rear-view\n        mirror.  He sees the xenon searchlight of the chopper behind them,\n        gaining.\n\n        Sarah looks around the inside of the SWAT van.  It is a rolling\n        armory.  There are rifles, ballistic vests, all manner of equipment.\n\n                                SARAH\n                John, get under these.  Hurry!\n\n        He sits against the front bulkhead of the van and she pile bullet-\n        proof vests on top of him, completely covering him.  Then she grabs\n        two M-16s from the wall-rack and loads them.  She starts on a shotgun\n        as --\n\n180     The SWAT van weaves through sparse traffic at high speed.\n        Terminator slews the unstable van around cars and trucks which seem to\n        be crawling.  The van hits it top speed of eighty.  They swerve to\n        miss the back end of A WHITE 18-WHEEL TANKER.\n180A    The chopper swings in behind them, closing fast.\n180B    T-1000 reaches through the shattered canopy with the MPK machine\n        pistol and FIRES.  The back of the can CLANGS WITH HITS.  The door\n        windows are BLOWN IN.\n\n        Terminator weaves the van, trying to throw off the T-1000's aim.\n        The unstable vehicle screeches and wobbles on the edge of control.\n        One of the doors is kicked open.  Sarah, wearing a ballistic vest,\n        crouches in the doorway, whipping up the M-16.  SHE OPENS FIRE.\n\n180C    Bullets riddle what's left of the chopper's canopy as the T-1000\n        returns fire.\n        The van is stitched with hits.\n\n180D    INSIDE THE VAN holes are punched through the thin sheet-metal walls,\n        ripping up the interior.  The vests covering John are hit repeatedly.\n        We see that Sarah has hung two Kevlar vests on the inside of the back\n        door and she ducks behind these as bullets hit around her.  She pops\n        back out and fires in controlled bursts.  The M-16 empties and she\n        grabs another.\n\n180E    Terminator serves around a car which is changing lanes, hitting it\n        and knocking it skidding.\n\n181     OMITTED\n\n181A    Sarah reloads and keeps firing.  The van swerves around a Toyota.  A\n        moment later the helicopter passes it, the rotor just clearing the top\n        of the car.\n\n181B    T-1000 FIRES the machine pistol.\n181C    Sarah has popped out to fire.  She takes a HIT in the thigh, and\n        several rounds hammer into her Kevlar vest.  She is thrown back onto\n        the floor of the van.  She lies there, an exposed target...\n\n181D    Terminator sees the T-1000 preparing to fire again.\n        He locks up the van's brakes.  Tires scream as the vehicle shimmies.\n        Sarah is thrown forward, sliding up to the bulkhead next to John.\n182     And the helicopter SLAMS RIGHT INTO THE BACK OF THE VAN.\n        The rotor disintegrates.  The back doors of the van are crushed in as\n        the canopy, the whole front of the fuselage is HAMMERED INTO JUNK,\n        trapping the T-1000 inside the twisted metal.  The chopper hits the\n        pavement, flips, sideways, and cartwheels... smashing itself into a\n        shapeless mass of twisted metal.\n        It falls away behind the van, tumbling end over end.\n\n182A    Terminator fights to control the van, which is fishtailing violently\n        from the impact.  It smashes up against the center divider, screeching\n        along the concrete, and then pulls away.  Terminator puts the hammer\n        down and the van accelerates.  He swerves to avoid an UGLY PICKUP\n        crawling like a snail ahead.\n\n        THE RIGHT FRONT FENDER of the van, crumpled by slamming the wall, is\n        sawing into the tire.  The tire blows and peels off the clean rim.\n        The steel wheel grinds across the pavement, striking trails of sparks,\n        and the van slides sideways and topples --\n        STEEL SCREAMS on pavement as the van grinds to a stop on its side.\n\n182B    INSIDE THE VAN, John crawls to Sarah, who is groaning and holding her\n        bleeding leg.  She is white and shocky.  Terminator starts to\n        extricate himself from the crumpled driver's seat.\n\n183     BACK DOWN THE ROAD, THE HELICOPTER wreckage is a crumpled ball of junk\n        metal, unrecognizable.  Behind it, the TANKER TRUCK brakes hard, \n        shuddering and groaning, trying to stop.  The big tires lock up in\n        clouds of tire-smoke.  The rig comes to a shuddering stop just short\n        of the wrecked chopper.\n\n183A    The shaken DRIVER jumps down.\n        The behind the wreckage a cop emerges, walking toward him.\n\n                                DRIVER\n                Goddamn, are you alri --\n\n183B    SSSHHCK!  T-1000 drives a blade through the man's abdomen and walks\n        on past without slowing, or even looking at him.\n\n183C    It climbs into the open cab of the tanker.  Releases the brake.\n        As the truck bellows are rolls forward we see the large blue letters\n        on the side which say \"CRYOCO INC.  LIQUID NITROGEN SUPPLY'.\n\n184     AT THE SWAT VAN John and Terminator are carrying Sarah out of the\n        wreck.  Terminator has the M-79 slung over his shoulder, the\n        bandolier of grenades, and his .45 stuck in his waistband.  John has\n        borrowed a 12-GAUGE RIOT GUN from the SWATs.\n\n184A    The pickup they passes seconds earlier pulls up to them.  The DRIVER,\n        A Hispanic guy in his 50's, is getting out to help them.  Terminator\n        and John hear a CRASH and look back as the\n185     helicopter wreckage is knocked aside by the accelerating tanker truck.\n\n186                             JOHN\n                Holy shit.  Come on, Mom... we gotta keep\n                moving... come on --\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                        (to the pickup owner)\n                We need your truck.\n\n        The guy seems to know better than to try and stop him as Terminator\n        slides Sarah into the front seat and climbs in behind the wheel.  John\n        runs to the passenger side.\n\n187     THE TANKER ROARS, spewing smoke from its chrome stacks as it shifts\n        up through the gears.\n\n188     Terminator slams the pickup in gear, checking the rear-view.  The\n        tanker is a hundred feet behind them now, and really moving.\n        Terminator puts the throttle down, but the pickup is and old slug\n        loaded down by a heavy home-made wooden camper-shell.  It accelerates\n        slowly.\n\n189     THE TANKER slams into one end of the SWAT van, spinning it out of the\n        way with a roar and screech of twisting metal.  The 18-wheeler shifts\n        to a higher gear, still accelerating.\n\n190     INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK\n\n        With the tanker right behind them, Terminator cuts the wheel, swerving\n        the pickup back and forth across the lanes.\n        The big rig stays right on them, it tanker whiplashing violently.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Faster!  He's right on us!\n\n        Terminator doesn't reply.  He rapidly unslings the blooper, still\n        around his neck, and reaches for a grenade.\n\n191     LOW ANGLE ON THE TRACTOR-TRAILER as it roars right up to the lens,\n        filling frame with chrome and lights.\n\n191A    K-WHAM!!  It rams the backs of the pickup, sending it skidding.\n\n191B    Then the T-1000 pulls the tractor trailer up alongside the pickup and\n        crabs over, sandwiching it against the center divider.  The spinning\n        chrome hubs tear into the passenger side door and the guard rail\n        screeches along the other side.\n\n        The pickup bucks and shakes insanely.  It ricochets violently between\n        the big-rig and the divider\n        Horrible SCREECH of tortured steel.\n        Sparks pour in sheets of fire from both sides.\n        The windshield shatters as the door-posts buckle in.\n        Metal and glass shower in through the side windows.\n        The frame twists and buckles.  John feels like the fillings are being\n        shaken right out of his teeth.\n        The wooden camper disintegrates, falling away as kindling behind\n        them.\n\n191C    INT. TANKER CAB\n\n        T-1000 holds the wheel hard over, mercilessly grinding the pickup.\n        The whole rig jerks and shakes with the violence of the sustained\n        hammering.\n\n191D    INT./EXT. PICKUP\n\n        Terminator slides toward the passenger side.  Keeping his foot on the\n        gas he lifts John over him and puts him in the driver's seat.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Drive for a minute.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Where you going?!\n\n        Terminator slams the shattered windshield with the palm of his hand.\n        Held together by the plastic laminate, the windshield flops out of its\n        frame.  It flies over the top of the truck.\n\n191E    Terminator pushes his upper body out over the dashboard and stands up.\n        He turns and aims the M-79 one-handed.\n191F    POOM!  The grenade misses the T-1000 by less than a foot.  It EXPLODES\n        against the front bulkhead of the tanker, almost at the top.  Liquid\n        nitrogen pours from the opening, swept back by the 60-mph windstream.\n\n191G    The big-rig swerves as T-1000 regains control.  The tanker swings like\n        a pendulum behind the cab.\n\n191H    The pickup accelerates, getting back out in front by a few yards.\n        Behind it the big-rig is trailing a swirling comet-tail of nitrogen\n        vapor.  It is gaining again.\n\n        Terminator, still standing, opens the breech and starts to reload.\n191I    John cuts across the highway and takes an OFF RAMP.\n\n191J    T-1000 swerves the smoking behemoth across the lanes and down the\n        ramp after him, still accelerating.  It is twenty feet behind them\n        and closing when Terminator closes the breech and FIRES.\n\n191K    The grenade hits the front grill and EXPLODES.\n        The radiator is destroyed, along with half the hood.  Steam blasts\n        out, obscuring the whole front of the truck.\n\n191L    The semi rams the back of the pickup again.  Spewing smoke and vapor\n        like some demon locomotive, the tractor-trailer pounds into the back\n        of the pickup.  Driving it right through the intersection at the\n        bottom of the ramp, and straight toward --\n\n        EXT. STEEL MILL\n\n        The chase has led them to an area of heavy industry.\n\n192     THE GATES are blasted off their hinges as the semi rams the pickup\n        right through them.  Terminator struggles to reload amid the chaos\n        and impacts.  He has THREE GRENADES LEFT on the bandolier.\n\n        John isn't even steering.  They are just being pushed.  There's\n        nothing he can do.  They are rocketing down the broad thoroughfare\n        which leads directly to the MAIN BUILDING of the plant.\n\n192A    Terminator pulls himself onto the roof of the pickup.\n        He leaps to the bed, takes two powerful strides and --\n        Leaps onto the semi.  He climbs rapidly onto the hood.\n192B    And FIRES POINT BLANK THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.\n        Right into T-1000's face.\n        The EXPLOSION blows out all the glass and fills the cab with smoke\n        and fire  Terminator grabs onto the air-horn as the truck starts to\n        SHUDDER AND\n192C    SCREAM.  IT IS JACK-KNIFING.\n        Almost dream-slow the cab begins to swing sideways, until its tires\n        are shrieking over the pavement.  The tractor is smashed back at\n        right-angles to the tanker-trailer which begins to slide broadside.\n\n192D    The juggernaut bucks and shudders as the tires and smoke sideways\n        across the pavement.\n        It begins to topple.\n        Terminator hold on as the side of cab becomes the top.\n        With an unholy scream, like the unoiled hubs of Hell, the whole rig\n        slides on its side at 60 mph toward the steel mill.  A sheet of sparks\n        sixty feet wide trails behind it on the pavement.\n\n192E    John sees what's behind him, then snaps around to see the building\n        looming right in front.  The huge rolling doors are partly open.\n        No choice.\n        He steers right through them into the mill, as --\n\n192F    Terminator, with one second to go, leaps from the cab --\n        He flies through the open doors as --\n        The tanker hits the building and --\n\n193     INT. STEEL MILL/MAIN AISLE\n\n        Terminator slams to the floor of the mill and rolls, as --\n        The tanker-trailer smashed into a massive concrete support at one side\n        of the doors.  Thunderous carnage of twisting metal.              o\n193A    It splits wide open.  A river of liquid nitrogen pours out at -230.\n\n193B    John hits the brakes, sliding out of control.  He slows almost to a\n        stop but hits a steel support column head-on.  He and Sarah are\n        slammed forward, hard.\n\n193C    Terminator, still clutching the M-79 blooper, rolls and slides across\n        the floor.\n        He smashes through a railing and slams up against the base of a\n        massive machine.\n\n193D    The semi cab swings about the trailer wreckage, into the building, and\n        shudders to a stop.  Liquid nitrogen sprays over the cab, flooding out\n        around it in a HISSING WAVEFRONT OF ULTRACOLD.\n        Freezing vapor swirls everywhere, obscuring the wreck.\n\n193E    TERMINATOR lies still.  A beat.  Then he rolls weakly, rising on one\n        elbow to survey the scene.\n\n193F    IN THE WRECKED PICKUP, John stirs.  He is stunned, and blood runs from\n        his nose.  Dazed, he realizes he is in a steel mill.  There are\n        sirens, and he can see men running... shouting.  He turns and sees\n        what they are running from...\n\n193G    The wall of nitrogen vapor spreads from the demolished tanker.  It is\n        a strange vista of fire and ice.  The huge SMELTERS pour out orange\n        light and fire from the sides of the huge galley, while the freezing\n        vapor rolls down the center.\n\n193H    TIGHT ON THE WRECK.  A billowing gray cloud.  Deep inside, the shape\n        of the cab in visible.  A FIGURE emerges, pulling itself out.  It\n        drops to the floor.  The hissing, boiling river of liquid nitrogen\n        flows around its feet.\n\n194     The T-1000 staggers, moving slowly, painfully.  It has finally been\n        affected by something.  Its feet are freezing to the ground as it\n        walks...\n\n194A    CLINK!  One of its feet breaks off at a glassy angle.  It stumbles\n        forward, and --\n194B    Its other foot snaps off.  As it catches its balance on the stump of\n        its other ankle,\n194C    the whole lower leg shatters at the impact.  It topples forward to its\n        knees.\n        Catches itself on one hand.  Liquid nitrogen flows around the hand.\n\n        Now the hand is stuck to the pavement.\n194D    The T-1000 pulls and... CLINK!  The hand snaps off at the wrist.\n        It looks stupidly at the glassy stump of a wrist.  For the first time\n        we see an expression on its face we know to be a true one...\n        The expression is pain.  Agony.  Its mouth opens in a soundless\n        scream as the hoar-frost races up its legs, across its body.\n194E    And that's the position it freezes in.\n        It has become a statue, kneeling in the frozen vapor, that surprised\n        look of agony frozen on its face.\n\n        The liquid nitrogen stops flowing and begins to evaporate.\n194F    Terminator, just beyond the boundary of the cold, can see the T-1000\n        clearly.\n        He draws his .45 and aims.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Hasta la vista, baby.\n\n194G    K-POW!  The single shot blows the T-1000 into a million diamonds\n        spraying up into the air.  They shimmer across the ground for twenty\n        feet in all directions.\n        Terminator lowers the gun, satisfied.\n        He looks like he needs a vacation.\n\n195     JOHN AND SARAH have seen it from the pickup.  She is in bad shape.\n        Conscious but very weak.  He tries the door.  It's jammed.  He kicks\n        it open.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Okay, Mom, we gotta get out now, come on.\n                That's it.\n\n        He helps her slide down from the seat of the truck.  Her knees give\n        way.  John has to take a lot of her weight.  He reaches in and picks\n        up the riot gun off the seat.  They hobble toward --\n\n195A    TERMINATOR.  On his knees, he looks into the dissipating cloud of\n        vapor.  The heat of the furnaces has evaporated all the liquid\n        nitrogen.\n\n196     INSERT, TIGHT ON THE FLOOR - the T-1000 shards are melting,\n        liquefying.  Hundreds of drops of mercury, spattered across the floor.\n        Orange light of the enormous black-furnaces dances on liquid metal.\n\n197     TERMINATOR struggles to rise.  One arm is shattered, the hand smashed\n        and useless.  And some leg-servos are damaged.  He can barely stand.\n        John and Sarah arrive.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                We don't have much time.\n\n                                JOHN\n                What?\n\n        Terminator points.  John and Sarah watch as --\n\n198     INSERT, T-1000 DROPLETS are creeping together.  Fusing into larger\n        blobs.  These pools shiver and run together, soon forming a central\n        mass.\n\n199     ON JOHN AND SARAH, realizing it's not over.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Come on!  Let's go!\n\n        Terminator gets one of Sarah's arms over his shoulder and they go.\n        BEHIND THEM, something is moving.\n200     A HEAD is forming up out of a pool mercury.  it rises, as shoulders\n        form.  hunching up from the liquid mass.  Half-formed, it turns to \n        look straight at them.\n\n        John looks back in new terror as --\n\n        The T-1000 rises to man-height.  It is still in mercury form, but its\n        features are forming rapidly.  It takes its first step after them.\n        Sarah stumbles and they pull her up.\n201     Terminator himself has a pronounces limp, dragging one leg with a\n        shattered ankle joint.  John's the one pulling, straining, driving\n        them forward.  They round a corner into --\n\n202     INT. AISLE BETWEEN FURNACES\n\n        It is a maze of monstrous machinery.  The heat is tremendous.\n        The air shivers with a pounding roar.\n        Sarah cries out in pain and stumbles again.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Come on, Mom, you can do it!  Come on!!\n\n        They drag her up, and stagger on.  Her leg is bathed in blood and she\n        is deathly pale.  He looks back.\n\n203     INT, MAIN GALLERY\n\n        The T-1000 steps INTO FRAME.  Fully formed.  The hell-fire light\n        glints on its impassive cop face.  It walks forward.  At first it\n        seems unaffected by its crystallization but --\n\n203A    ANGLE ON ITS HAND as it touches a railing in passing.  The railing is\n        covered with O.S.H.A. yellow-and-black safety tape.\n        The hand turns yellow and black, the color fading to normal by about\n        the elbow.  It rips the hand from the railing with difficulty.  There\n        is a sound like adhesive tape ripping off a surface.\n\n203B    The T-1000 looks at its yellow-and-black striped hand.  It wills the\n        hand back to normal.  We see ripples of \"static\" or system noise\n        moving subtly over the surface of its body.  It's starting to\n        \"glitch\".\n\n203C    TRACKING WITH THE T-1000'S FEET.  With each step, the pattern on the\n        tile floor \"invades\" its lower legs.  Fades as the foot is lifted.\n        Returns as it is set down.  The foot is trying to meld with the floor.\n        The chameleonic function is out of control.\n        The T-1000 is losing it.  It moves forward, searching.  It rounds the\n        corner, entering the aisle between the furnaces.\n\n204     INT. AISLE\n\n        Terminator sees the SILHOUETTE closing on them through the smoky\n        gleam.  The T-1000 breaks into loping run when it sees them,\n        Terminator turns to Sarah over John.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Keep going.\n\n        John shakes his head no.  The T-1000 is almost on them.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                RUN!\n\n        John runs, dragging, half-carrying Sarah as best he can.\n        She can barely stay conscious.  Half-running, delirious, she stumbles\n        and drops to her knees.  John pulls but she can't rise.\n\n                                JOHN\n                        (crying, shouting)\n                Come on, you gotta try... please, Mom.  Get up!\n\n        John looks back to see --\n\n204A    TERMINATOR trying to load the M-79.  With his shattered hand, he can\n        barely maneuver is last grenade into the breech.\n        T-1000 smacks the weapon out of his hands.  It clatters to the floor.\n\n        The grenade spins across the floor, rolling under some machinery.\n        Terminator lunges, slamming the T-1000 against a wall with all his\n        weight.  The battle is joined.\n\n204B    JOHN AND SARAH have reached the back of the aisle.  It is a cul-de-\n        sac, blocked on the end by the base of an IMMENSE SMELTER CRUCIBLE.\n        They turn to watch the titans battle in silhouette, backlit by the\n        molten sparks falling from the furnaces above.  The battle which will\n        decide their fate.\n\n204C    Terminator grabs the T-1000 and hurls it with awesome force against\n        the opposite wall of the narrow alley.  In less time than it would\n        take to turn, the\n204D    T-1000 morphs trough itself, front to back... face emerging from the\n        back of its head.\n204E    It comes off the wall straight at Terminator, who smashes his good\n        fist into its face.  The pile-driver blow buries Terminator's fist\n        almost to the elbow.\n\n204F    But the T-1000's head morphs in a split-second into a hand which grips\n        Terminator's wrist, and the head \"emerges\" somewhere else, the\n        geometry shifting faster than we can follow.\n204G    The T-1000 slams Terminator into a large machine, jamming his arm into\n        the moving works.  A massive sliding bar SCISSORS HIS ARM, smashing it\n        into junk at the elbow, pinning him in the machine.\n\n        Terminator strains against the machine pinning him.  We hear his\n        servos whining with overload.  The T-1000 turns and lopes toward Sarah\n        and John.\n\n        Sarah screams and hurls John into a gap between the machines.  He\n        falls into a maze of pipes and girders.\n\n205     INT. MAZE OF MACHINES\n\n        JOHN turns to see her in the entrance of the narrow gap.  She could\n        follow him but she doesn't.  SUDDENLY a dark mass moves toward him.\n        John gasps as a huge steel counterweight, driven by a chain 6 inches\n        thick, slides toward him.  He rolls out of the way.  When he looks\n        back, he cannot see the opening.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Mom!  MOMMM!!\n\n206     INT. AISLE BETWEEN FURNACES\n\n        TERMINATOR strains to reach a 6-foot steel bar lying near him.  Steel\n        workers use them to move the red-hot ingots around.  He gets hold of\n        the end and uses it as a lever.  With titanic effort he spreads the\n        massive components which are holding him, and withdraws him arm, which\n        is severed at the elbow.  Dangling junk hands from the crushed joint.\n\n207     SARAH has lost sight of John.  It is much of a goodbye as they will\n        have.\n        She turns as the T-1000 closes on her.  She is half-slumped against\n        the sooty machines, looking barely conscious.  She struggles to load\n        a shell into the empty weapon.  At the last instant she whips up the\n        RIOT GUN and FIRES.\n\nA207    T-1000's face is blown open, but quickly reforms as it closes on her.\n        She fumbles to get another shell into the magazine but --\nA208    THUNK!  A steel needle slams through her shoulder, pinning her.\n        The polymorphic killer cocks back its other hand.  The index finger\n        extends as a gleaming needle, toward her eye --\n\n                                T-1000\n                Call to John.  Now.\n\n207C    WHAM!!  SOMETHING whistles down on the T-1000 with such force that is\n        cleaves it head and body in two down to the naval.  The 6-foot steel\n        bar is imbedded in its body.  Terminator hurls the killer off Sarah.\n\n207D    The T-1000 pulls the steel shaft out of itself and attacks him with\n        fury.\n        Swinging again and again.  Hammering Terminator back.  Terminator\n        falls back against the wall.\n\n        Behind the T-1000 is an enormous I-beam, hanging from two chains.  It\n        is used to lift ingots into the smelters, and it runs on a linear\n        track.\n207E    The T-1000 grabs the I-beam and rolls it down the track.  Straight at\n        Terminator.  The two-ton girder smashes into his chest, crushing the\n        armor.\n        The T-1000 pulls the I-beam back, and then heaves it forward again.\n        Terminator turns and takes the second blow on the shoulder.  We hear\n        metal crush and break inside him.  He sags, turning to grip the\n        wall...\n        The third blow slams into his back, smashing his spine and pelvis.  We\n        hear servos ratcheting and failing.  He drops to his knees, crucified\n        on a wall of machinery.\n        The fourth blow is centered between his shoulder blades.  Sound of\n        crushing metal.  His skull is partially caved in.\n        He slides to the floor.\n\n207F    ON THE T-1000, emotionless as it walks forward.\n\n207G    TERMINATOR is a pathetic shape on the floor.  He is trying to crawl,\n        feebly.\n        Dragging his malfunctioning legs behind the crushed spine.  His arm\n        stump screeches on the tile floor as he inches himself forward.  His\n        exposed machine eye burns red with determination.\n\n        We see his prize.  He has the M-79, with the breech still open, \n        cradled in the crook of his ruined arm.  He good hand, the exposed\n        steel one, is reaching for the last grenade, which is visible under\n        the skirt of the massive smelter base.  His metal fingers reach out\n        for it as --\n\n207H    The T-1000 raises the heavy steel bar over his head and stabs it down\n        with unbelievable force.  It punches into Terminator's back, through a\n        gap in the shattered armor.  The T-1000 levers it back and forth,\n        widening the hole.  Then is raises the pointed bar again and slams it\n        down.\n        It punches right through.  Emerging from Terminator's chest.\n        And into the floor.  He is pinioned.  The cyborg sags face down and\n        stop moving.  The light goes out of his eye.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n208     INT. MAZE OF MACHINERY\n\n        John scuttles like a rat through the gut of the smelter.  Above him,\n        vast machines churn untended.  He hears a voice... SARAH'S\n        Calling low and urgent to him.\n\n                                SARAH\n                John?  John?  Can you hear me?  Where are you?\n\n208A    He crawls out of the shadows.\n        Onto a landing next to one of the SMELTER CRUCIBLES.  Molten steel\n        glows bright orange in the crucible of the furnace.  Heat shimmers\n        the air, giving everything a hallucinatory quality.\n\n        John sees Sarah nearby, limping toward him.  She can barely move, her\n        leg bathed in blood.  He runs toward her.\n\n                                SARAH\n                        (gasping)\n                Help me, honey...\n\n        TIGHT ON SARAH, her stoic face, as she hobbles forward, reaching out\n        to him.  Something rises behind her, OUT OF FOCUS.\n\n209     ANOTHER, IDENTICAL, SARAH... but this one has a shotgun.\n        Aimed right at us.\n\n209A    JOHN freezes.  Which is which?  He looks down.  The first Sarah's\n        feet are melded with the floor, sucking and fusing with the tiles as\n        she walks.  They have the color and pattern of the tiles up to the\n        knee.\n\n                                SARAH\n                John, get out of the way!!\n\n                                JOHN\n                        (screaming)\n                SHOOT!!!!\n\n209B    John dives aside.  The Sarah-form spins, changing into you-know-who.\n        Sarah starts unloading the shotgun into it.  BOOM!  It staggers back.\n        K-CHAK.  She chambers another round.  BOOM!  It staggers again.\n        K-CHAK.  BOOM!  And again.  And again.\n\n209C    The T-1000 is blown back a step and Sarah advances with each shot.\n        The craters in the T-1000's body \"heal\" slowly.  Its power is waning.\n        She FIRES again.  And again.  Her eyes blazing with feral intensity.\n        She walks it back, right to the edge of the pit of MOLTEN STEEL.\n\n        K-CHAK... CLICK.  She's empty.  The T-1000 is right at the edge.  In a\n        second it will recover its composure, as its crater hits close slowly.\n        She has failed.  Now it will kill them both,\n        Except...\n\n210     CLOSEUP TERMINATOR, as the chain drive brings it into view.\n        Half human flesh, half chrome steel.\n        His red eye gazes right at us as he --\n        FIRES.\n\n210A    The T-1000 takes the round in the belly.  The grenade EXPLODES inside\n        its body.  A huge hole is blown clean through it, and it is ripped\n        open and peeled back, half inside-out.  It topples into the molten\n        steel and --\n\n211     The T-1000's head and upper body reappear above the molten steel.\n        It is screaming.  A terrifying, inhuman siren of a scream.\n        It is changing, morphing, transforming into anything and everything\n        it's ever been so rapidly the eye can barely follow it --\n        We catch a glimpse of Janelle Voight checkered with the linoleum tile\n        colors, Lewis the Guard with knives exploding from his face, other\n        faces, switching at a stroboscopic rate now... a face every two frames\n        until they merge into one face --\n\n        The T-1000 screams and slips beneath the surface of the molten steel.\n        We see liquid silver running in dissipating whorls over the\n        superheated surface... until it vanishes, swirling into nothing.\n\n212     JOHN runs to Sarah.  She stands staring into the pit.  The empty\n        shotgun slips from her fingers.  Clatters to the floor.  He sees that\n        she's okay and he runs to the fallen Terminator.\n\n212A    The crippled cyborg is trying to rise.  Its servos whine and stutter.\n        It pathetically lifts itself to a kneeling position, collapses...\n        tries again.\n        John lifts for all he's worth.  Sarah joins them, helping.\n        The help the crippled machine get on its feet.  It can barely stand.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                I need a vacation.\n\n        They walk to the edge of the pit.  Terminator looks down and sees\n        that it is over.\n\n                                JOHN\n                        (to Terminator)\n                Is it dead?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Terminated.\n\n        John unzips Sarah's backpack and takes out the hand of the first\n        terminator.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Will it melt in there?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Yes.  Throw it in.\n        \n        He does.  It sinks into the lava.  Vanishes.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                And the chip.\n\n        John takes it out of his pocket.  Looks at it.  Tosses it into the\n        smelter.\n\n                                SARAH\n                It's finally over.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                No.  There is another chip.\n\n        He touches a metal finger to the side of his head.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                And it must be destroyed also.\n\n        John suddenly understands what he means.\n        Terminator looks at Sarah.  They both know what must be done.\n        John shakes his head.\n\n                                JOHN\n                No!\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                I'm sorry, John.\n\n                                JOHN\n                No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                I have to go away, John.\n\n                                JOHN\n                Don't do it.  Please... don't go --\n\n        Tears are streaming down his face.\n\n        TIGHT CLOSEUP TERMINATOR, turning toward John.\n        The human side of his face is in shadow, so we see mostly the chrome\n        skull and the red eye.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                It must end here... or I am the future.\n\n                                JOHN\n                I order you not to!\n\n        Terminator puts his hand on John's shoulder.  He moves slightly and\n        the human side of his face comes into the light.\n        He reaches toward John's face.  His metal finger touches the tear\n        trickling down his cheek.\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                I know now why you cry.  But it is something I\n                can never do.\n                        (to both of them)\n                Goodbye.\n\n        Sarah looks at Terminator.  Reaches out her hand to shake it.\n        They lock eyes.  Warriors.  Comrades.\n\n                                SARAH\n                Are you afraid?\n\n                                TERMINATOR\n                Yes.\n\n        He turns and steps off the edge.\n213     They watch him sink into the lava.\n        He disappears... the metal hand sinking last... at the last second it\n        forms into a fist with the thumb extended... a final thumbs up.\n        Then it is gone.\n\n214     HOLD ON JOHN AND SARAH, watching through the heat ripples as we --\n\n                                                DISSOLVE TO:\n\n215     THE SUN, PURE IN A CLOUDLESS SKY\n        Tilting down reveal that we are in a park, very green.  People are\n        casually dressed, having fun.  Cycling, reading... children are\n        playing in a playground.\n\n        Beyond the line of tree we see the skyline of Washington, D.C., with\n        the Capital Building and the Washington Monument.  The skyline is\n        subtly changed, with a lot of new buildings, advanced high-rises.\n        A CARD APPEARS\n\n                                July 11, 2029\n\n        WE BOOM DOWN AND TRACK LATERALLY through a playground in the\n        foreground.  Children swinging on swings.  Sliding down slides.\n        Timeless things that 4 decades of technical advancement will not\n        change.  As we track we hear:\n\n                                SARAH (V.O.)\n                August 29th 1997 came and went.  Nothing much\n                happened.  Michael Jackson turned forty.  There\n                was no Judgment Day.  People went to work as\n                they always do, laughed, complained, watched\n                TV, made love.\n\n        We pass a jungle gym, neither melted nor burned, but full of kids\n        swinging and yelling raucously.  Past it we drop down to see a boy\n        pumping the pedals of a tricycle.\n\n                                SARAH (V.O.)\n                I wanted to run down the street yelling... to\n                grab them all and say \"Every day form this day\n                is a gift.

But the dark future\n                which never came still exists for me, and it\n                always will, like the traces of a dream lingering\n                in the morning light.

SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. DAY\n\t\n\tThe October sun slashes through the gray clouds, cuts across the\n\tshadow towards the sea, along the coast where the new suburbs of the\n\tcity of Giancaldo have been built up.\n\t\n\tBright light streams through the windows, glancing off the white\n\twalls in an almost blinding reflection. MARIA, a woman a little over\n\tsixty, is trying to find somebody on the phone.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\t...Salvatore, that's right, \n\t\tSalvatore. Di Vita Salvatore\n\t\t...But, miss, what do you mean you \n\t\tdon't know him?!...I...Yes...\n\t\t\t(She gives a nervous sigh. \n\t\t\tShe has dialed her way \n\t\t\tthrough endless numbers \n\t\t\tbut still hasn't managed \n\t\t\tto speak to Mr. Di\n\t\t\tVita. She finally heaves a \n\t\t\tsigh of relief.)\n\t\t...That's right, good for you! \n\t\tOh!...yes...And I'm his\n\t\tmother. I'm calling from Sicily. Been \n\t\ttrying all day...Ah, he's not \n\t\tthere...But would you be so kind as \n\t\tto give me...?...Yes...\n\t\t\t(She nods at another woman \n\t\t\taround forty sitting \n\t\t\tnearby: it is LIA, her \n\t\t\tdaughter, who jots down \n\t\t\tthe numbers her \n\t\t\tmother dictates:)\n\t\t...Six, five, six, two, two, oh, \n\t\tsix...Thanks ever so\n\t\tmuch...Goodbye. Goodbye.\n\t\n\tShe hangs up, takes the number LIA has jotted down, determined to have still \n\tanother try. LIA speaks to her as if she were a baby, to be more convincing.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tLIA  \n\t\tLook, Ma...It's useless calling him. \n\t\tHe'll be terribly busy, God knows \n\t\twhere he is. Besides he might not \n\t\teven remember. Do as I say, forget \n\t\tit...He hasn't been here for thirty \n\t\tyears. You know how he is. \n\t\n\tMARIA pauses to think it over. The decision she has to make is important. Then, \n\tstubbornly.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\tHe'll remember! He'll remember! \n\t\t\t(She puts on her glasses \n\t\t\tand starts dialing \n\t\t\tthe number.)\n\t\t...I'm positive. I know him better \n\t\tthan you do. If he were to find \n\t\tout we hadn't told him, he'd be \n\t\tangry. I know. \n\t\t\t(She takes off her \n\t\t\tglasses.)\n\t\t...Hello? Good morning. Could I \n\t\tplease speak to Mr. Salvatore Di \n\t\tVita. I'm his mother...\n\t\n\t2  ROME. STREETS. EXT/INT. NIGHT\n\t\n\tIt's late, but there is still traffic on the streets heading downtown.\n\tInside a high-powered car, a man  around fifty is driving. It is\n\tSALVATORE Dl VITA. Elegant, just growing gray, a handsome face\n\tcreased by deep wrinkles. His weary expression hides the determined,\n\tsell-assured manner of the successful self-made man. He must be a\n\theavy smoker judging by the way he draws the last puffs on his\n\tcigarette.\n\t\n\tHe stops at a red light. He stubs out the cigarette and rolls down the\n\twindow, as a little Fiat Uno pulls up alongside. A rock tune plays full\n\tblast on the radio. SALVATORE turns instinctively to have a look at the\n\tman at the wheel  a BOY with a brush cut standing straight in the latest\n\tfashion. He studies the Boy's expression with almost exaggerated\n\tattention, but devoid of curiosity, coldly. The GIRL sitting beside him,\n\tlots of curly hair, overripe red lips, returns SALVATORE'5 look,\n\tprovocatively. The BOY notices, turns to SALVATORE in a surly voice:\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBOY  \n\t\tHey! What the fuck you looking at!?\n\t\n\tGreen light. The Fiat Uno shoots off, leaving a trail of music in its wake.\n\t\n\t3  ROME. SALVATORE S APARTMENT. INT. NIGHT \n\t\n\tThe apartment is luxurious, tastefully furnished. There is no one waiting for \n\tSALVATORE. Through the picture window on the terrace, the city can be seen \n\tslumbering in the night. SALVATORE gets undressed on his way to the bedroom. He \n\tmoves quietly, as if to make no noise. He doesn't even turn on the light, \n\tfinishes getting undressed in the pale blue glow coming from the picture window. \n\tA rustling sound, a movement on the bed, the voice of a woman waking up. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tCLARA  \n\t\tSalvatore...But what time is it? \n\t\n\tShe turns on the bedside light. It is CLARA, a young woman around thirty. \n\tSALVATORE climbs in beside her under the covers, kisses her sweetly, then in a \n\twhisper.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tIt's late, Clara. Sorry, but I wasn't \n\t\table to let you know I wouldn't be \n\t\tcorning...\n\t\t\t(He fondles her, but he is \n\t\t\ttired, feels like \n\t\t\tsleeping.) \n\t\tGo to sleep now. Sleep.\n\t\n\tHe turns over on the other side. CLARA shuts her eyes, is about to drop off, \n\tbut whispers.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCLARA  \n\t\tYour mother phoned. She took me for \n\t\tsomebody else...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(Surprised) \n\t\tAnd what'd you tell her?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCLARA  \n\t\tI played dumb, so as not to \n\t\tdisappoint her. We had a nice little \n\t\ttalk. She says you never go see her, \n\t\tand when she wants to see you she has \n\t\tto come to Rome...Is it true?\n\t\n\tSALVATORE doesn't answer. God only knows how often he's heard that question \n\tbefore.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tShe phoned just to say that? \n\t\n\tShe reaches out to switch of the light, buries her head into the pillow.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCLARA  \n\t\tShe said a certain Alfredo had died. \n\t\tAnd the funeral's taking place \n\t\ttomorrow afternoon...\n\t\t\t(A strange look suddenly \n\t\t\tcomes into SALVATORE'S \n\t\t\teyes. The idea of going to \n\t\t\tsleep has clearly left \n\t\t\thim. It's a piece of news \n\t\t\the didn't expect. That's \n\t\t\ttaken him off-guard. CLARA \n\t\t\twould like to carry on the \n\t\t\tconversation, but \n\t\t\tsleepiness makes \n\t\t\tit almost impossible. An \n\t\t\tshe can manage is one last \n\t\t\tquestion in a faint little \n\t\t\tvoice:)\n\t\tWho is it? A relative of yours?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tNo. Sleep. Go to sleep.\n\t\n\tShe falls asleep in the dead silence of the night. SALVATORE is seized by a \n\tsort of chill a deep, troubled feeling. He gazes through the window al the city, \n\twith its shimmering lights still moving in the darkness, suddenly shrouded in a \n\theavy curtain of rain. But he gazes off, beyond the row of houses, beyond the \n\tdark sky; the shadow of a wind chime plays across his face summoning up endless \n\tmemories, drawing forth from the infinite depths of oblivion a past that he \n\tthought had vanished, been wiped out, and instead now re-emerges, comes back to \n\tlife, takes on light, superimposing itself on the mellow middle-aged features of \n\this face, in the shadow of the city shaken by the storm, until another image is \n\tformed, an ancient, remote image...\n\t\n\t4  GIANCALDO. CHURCH AND SACRISTY. INT. MORNING\n\t\n\tAn image from over forty years before. In the baroque church of\n\tGiancaldo. SALVATORE is nine years old. Dressed as an altar boy, he\n\tis kneeling by the altar with a little silver bell in his hands. The\n\tcongregation is also kneeling. The PRIEST is consecrating the Host.\n\tLittle SALVATORE has just got out of bed, is still half-asleep, yawns\n\tand doesn't notice that the PRIEST is standing there with the Host in\n\tthe air glaring at him, as if trying to tell him something.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n\t\tPss! Pssst!\n\t\n\tSALVATORE finishes yawning and opening his eyes meets the\n\twithering look of the PRIEST. He gets the message at once and\n\trings the bell. Now the PRIEST can carry on, lifts the chalice and\n\tthe bell is heard again.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCut to:\n\t\n\tThe service is over. The PRIEST is in the sacristy removing his\n\tvestments. And SALVATORE is also there, removing his altar-boy\n\ttunic.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n\t\tBut how can I make you understand? \n\t\tWithout the bell I just can't go on! \n\t\tAlways half asleep, you are! What do \n\t\tyou do at night anyway? Eat instead \n\t\tof sleep?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tFather, at my house we don't even eat \n\t\tat noon. That's why I'm always \n\t\tsleepy. That's what the vet says.\n\t\n\tThe PRIEST has finished disrobing. He takes the bell\n\tSALVATORE was holding during the service and turns to leave.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n\t\tAll right, Toto, get moving, I've got \n\t\tthings to do. Say hello to your \n\t\tmother.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tCan I...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n\t\t\t(Interrupting him) \n\t\tAnd don't ask if you can come...\n\t\tBecause you can't!! Shoo, shoo, off \n\t\twith you!!\n\t\n\tSALVATORE gives a shrug and leaves. The PRIEST goes down a\n\tcorridor, opens a door, another corridor, and finally a door\n\tleading to an outside courtyard. He cuts across it and disappears\n\tinto another door.\n\t\n\t5  CINEMA PARADISO AND PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. MORNING\n\t\n\tThe PRIEST enters a movie house. Not very big  200 seats on the main\n\tfloor and another seventy in the balcony. Along the walls, posters of\n\tfilms to be shown are stuck up between the light fixtures. In one corner,\n\ta statue of the Virgin Mary with flowers. The CLEANING LADY has\n\tfinished work and is leaving. Up in the balcony, over the last row of\n\tseats, are the holes of the projection booth. The middle hole is\n\tcamouflaged by the huge head of a roaring lion, all in plaster, and the\n\tlens of the projector can be glimpsed between its sharp teeth.\n\tthere are two smaller holes, through which the figure of a man can be\n\tmade out, appearing and disappearing...It is ALFREDO, the\n\tprojectionist. He is around forty, skinny and bony with a tough\n\tpeasant face. He has finished loading the projector and is checking the\n\tcarbons in the arc lamp. Then he removes the glass from one of the\n\tholes and looks down into the theatre, at the PRIEST who waves his\n\thand.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n\t\tOK, Alfredo, you can start!!\n\t\n\tHe sits down an by himself in the middle of the empty theatre.\n\tUp in the booth, ALFREDO lights the arc lamp and sets the\n\tprojector going.\n\t\n\tDown in the theatre, the light goes off and out of the lion's mouth\n\tstreams the glowing ray aimed al the screen. String music, sweet\n\tand ominous, spreads through the theatre. On the screen appear\n\tthe credit titles of an American film of the 1940s. The PRIEST\n\tscrews up his face and holds the bell in his right hand resting on\n\tthe arm of his seat.\n\t\n\tAt the back of the theatre, behind the last row, a curtain moves,\n\topens a crack and SALVATORE'S gaunt little face appears. He\n\thas managed to sneak in somehow and stands there without a\n\tword, spellbound, watching the 'movie' on the glowing screen.\n\tThe credit titles have long come and gone. The story is at a\n\tturning-point. \n\t\n\tUp above, in the hole of the booth next to the lion,\n\tALFREDO watches the film, but his eyes keep looking down at the\n\tPRIEST, who is now drumming the bell with his fingers. On the\n\tscreen, the male and female lead, two Hollywood stars, are in\n\tclose-up; the dialogue is passionate, romantic. SALVATORE,\n\tcarried away by those faces, by the way they talk, by the beauty\n\tof the woman, slowly slips down the length of the curtain until he\n\tis sitting on the floor, his eyes glued to the screen. \n\t\n\tThe love scene reaches a climax, the music crescendos, and the love-struck \n\tcouple finally fall into each other's arms and kiss. Instinctively, the PRIEST \n\traises the bell into the air, as in some age-old ceremony, and gives it a loud \n\tring...\n\t\n\tUp in the booth ALFREDO hears the bell; it's the signal he's been\n\twaiting for. He takes a slip of paper from a pad prepared for that\n\tpurpose and sticks it into the loops of the film containing that\n\tspecific scene as it winds on to the reel. The projection\n\tcontinues...\n\t\n\t...And also the kiss of the two actors. The PRIEST'S nervous look lingers on \n\tthose black-and-white lips meeting and now pulling apart for one last \n\tdeclaration of love before separating. SALVATORE is wide-eyed, he's probably \n\tnever seen a man and woman kiss before, it's a vision that for him has all the \n\tattraction of forbidden fruit, the horror of sin. The screen is now filled with \n\tthe figure of a woman getting undressed, showing for one instant the white, \n\tvoluptuous flesh of her broad, naked shoulders. SALVATORE stares in open-mouthed \n\twonder. The PRIEST, in a fury, grabs the bell and shakes it for all he is worth. \n\tFrom the sound of the bell to another sound...\n\t\n\t6  GIANCALDO. MAIN SQUARE. EXT. DAY \n\t\n\tThe tolling of the bell-tower rings out over the \n\tsquare. It is noon. The vast square, pale and dusty, is alive with people. A \n\tnoisy line of men, women and cows waits in front of the fountain to get water. \n\tPeddlers hawk their wares in mournful cries. People come and go in front of the \n\ttown hall. The working men's club is deserted. The entrance of the Cinema \n\tParadiso is shut. Hanging outside is the poster of the film that has just been \n\tseen on screen. Up above, the windows of the projection booth are open. The hum \n\tof the projector can be heard and the loud, lofty music typical of 'THE END'. \n\tThen dead silence. The showing is over.\n\t\n\t7. CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY\n\t\n\tDespite the speed, numerous white streaks spin around on the reel,\n\tcreated by the slips of paper ALFREDO has inserted into the loops. He\n\tis rewinding the film by hand on the film-winder. When he's not\n\ttalking, ALFREDO usually sings to himself. SALVATORE stands beside\n\thim, taking in everything he does with those quick, thieving eyes of his\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(Harshly, shouting) \n\t\tYou must not come here! How many \n\t\ttimes do I have to tell you?\n\t\t\t(And he slows down the \n\t\t\treels with his hand. The \n\t\t\tslips of paper\n\t\t\tare about to arrive. \n\t\t\tHere's the first.)\n\t\tIf the film catches fire, runt that \n\t\tyou are, you'd go up in a\n\t\tburst of flame...whoosh! And turn \n\t\tinto a piece of...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(Overlapping him)\n\t\t...and turn into a piece of \n\t\tcharcoal!!\n\t\n\tHe's used to his terrorisms, pays no more attention. Not even his\n\tgrim look scares him. Anyway, ALFREDO catches the joke, starts to give him a \n\tslap, but instead reaches over and picks up a pair of scissors.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(Angrily) \n\t\tChrist, that's a sassy little tongue \n\t\tyou've got! Watch out, or someday \n\t\tI'll snip it off. \n\t\n\tAnd he snips a piece of film, pastes the ends together and goes on turning the \n\thandle. SALVATORE picks up the strip of film and gives it a closer look. He sees \n\ta series of frames all alike with a man kissing a woman.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tCan I have it? \n\t\n\tALFREDO snatches it out of his hand, furiously, at the end of his string. He \n\tshouts.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tNo!!! Are you deaf or something? I've \n\t\tgot to put this back in when we wind \n\t\tup the film again! You're a real pain \n\t\tin the neck! \n\t\n\tSALVATORE reaches into a basket full of strips of film. He takes out a handful: \n\tall kisses that have been cut.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tThen why didn't you put these back \n\t\twhen you wound up the films again? \n\t\n\tALFREDO is caught out. He stops the film where another slip of paper is stuck \n\tin and cuts the scene:\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t'Cause sometimes you can't find the \n\t\tright place any more and so...well, \n\t\tactually...they stay here. \n\t\t\t(Finding an excuse) \n\t\tBesides, there are more kisses than \n\t\tyou can count.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(Excited) \n\t\tSo I can have these? \n\t\t\t(ALFREDO explodes, flies \n\t\t\toff the handle. He grabs \n\t\t\tSALVATORE by the shoulders \n\t\t\tand shakes him.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tLook, Toto! Before I kick your ass \n\t\tall the way to China and back, let's \n\t\tmake a deal. These strips here are \n\t\tyours, I give them to you. However! \n\t\tOne  you're not to stick your nose in \n\t\there any more. Two  I'll keep them \n\t\tfor you, because you can't take them \n\t\thome for God forbid and save our \n\t\tsouls, if they catch fire, all hell \n\t\twill break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now \n\t\tscram! \n\t\n\tHe takes him and turns him towards the stairs. For him the matter is closed. He \n\treturns to the film-winder. SALVATORE sneaks back and while ALFREDO's attention \n\tis elsewhere, snatches up a handful of movie frames scattered on the counter, \n\tstuffs them into his pocket and...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tWhat sort of deal is this? The strips \n\t\tare mine! So why can't I come see \n\t\tthem? \n\t\n\tAnd he stares at ALFREDO with a sly, saucy look. ALFREDO clutches his hand, \n\tdarts forth like an arrow and is about to give him a kick in the ass. He \n\tshrieks:\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tGet out!! And don't show your face \n\t\there again! \n\t\n\tAnd before the kick reaches its destination, SALVATORE has already dashed off \n\tdown the spiral staircase.\n\t\n\t8  GIANCALDO. SALVATORE'S HOUSE. INT. EVENING\n\t\n\tThat was not the first theft of film strips. SALVATORE's hand reaches\n\tinto a flowery metal box jammed full of pieces of film. He takes out a\n\tfew frames and holds them up against the kerosene lamp. Gazes at the\n\tfigures that remind him of the films seen at Cinema Paradiso, and in a\n\twhisper mangles fragments of dialogue, the shooting of guns, the\n\tmusical climaxes...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tBang! Bang! Bang! Shoot first, think \n\t\tlater! This is no job for weaklings! \n\t\tTreacherous dog!\n\t\n\tThe house has no lights, is gloomy and cold. SALVATORE's\n\tmother, MARIA, is leaning on the table in front of him. She is\n\tyoung, around thirty, and her pretty face is haggard, marred by\n\tall the sacrifices. She is sewing some clothes, is a seamstress. LIA,\n\this four-year-old sister, is sleeping on a cot in one corner. The\n\tkerosene lamp projects the trembling shadow of the film strips on\n\tthe wall, figures of prairies, gunslingers, thugs. SALVATORE's\n\tvoice changes, turns even tougher.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE\n\t\tHey there, you lousy bastard, take \n\t\tyour hands off that gold, You black-\n\t\thearted pig, stay away from me, or \n\t\tI'll smash your face in! \n\t\t'Ntantatah!!!...\n\t\t\t(In the heap of movie \n\t\t\tframes there are also \n\t\t\tseveral photographs. \n\t\t\tSALVATORE picks them up. \n\t\t\tFamily keepsakes. A man in \n\t\t\tan army uniform. Then the \n\t\t\tsame man with a girl \n\t\t\tbeside him whose smiling \n\t\t\tface can be recognized as \n\t\t\tMARIA. SALVATORE takes a \n\t\t\tcloser look at the man's \n\t\t\tface, then whispers to his \n\t\t\tmother:)\n\t\tMa, if the war's over, how come \n\t\tDaddy's never come back?\n\t\n\tMARIA looks up at him with a sweet smile.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\tHe'll be back, he'll be back...\n\t\tYou'll see. One of these\n\t\tdays...\n\t\n\tBut there is not much conviction written on her face. She looks\n\tback down at her sewing. SALVATORE goes on looking at the\n\tphotos.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tI don't remember him any more—Ma, \n\t\twhere's Russia?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\tIt takes years to get there. And \n\t\tyears to come back...Now go to bed, \n\t\tToto, it's late.\n\t\n\tSALVATORE puts the photos back into the box and tucks the box\n\tunder LIA's cot near the charcoal burner.\n\t\n\t9  GRADE SCHOOL. COURTYARD. EXT. DAY\n\t\n\tA noisy crowd of little children in black smocks, white collars and blue\n\tbows moves about the large courtyard where there are two tall palm\n\ttrees. The boys head for one door, the girls towards the opposite one.\n\tThe Janitors line them up two by two, ready to enter. Here and there,\n\tparents and relatives accompany the younger ones. Beneath one of the\n\tpalms, SALVATORE pulls off the altar-boy tunic, stuffs it into the\n\tkhaki-colored cardboard schoolbag, takes out the smock and puts it\n\ton, as one of his schoolmates passes by. It is MASINO, and he's crying\n\tdesperately because he doesn't want to go to school. His FATHER drags\n\thim along, yelling:\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMASINO'S FATHER\n\t\tYou can fool your mother but not me! \n\t\tGet yourself a damn diploma and \n\t\tbecome a policeman. You good-for-\n\t\tnothing!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMASINO  \n\t\tI don't want to go to school'\n\t\t\t(The sound of the bell. \n\t\t\tThe black lines move up \n\t\t\tthe steps towards the \n\t\t\tschool.)\n\t\n\t1O  FOURTH GRADE. INT. DAY \n\t\n\tSALVATORE is sitting at the front-row desk next to PEPPINO, \n\ta little freckle-faced boy. His attention, like that of the whole class, is \n\tconcentrated on what is taking place at the blackboard. The TEACHER is standing \n\tthere, watching a plump little boy, shy and not quite all there, do a two-figure \n\tmultiplication  it is NICOLA SCORSONE, known as 'COLA'. He is red in the face, \n\thas one purple ear and one white one. He stares in terror at that '255 x 15' \n\twritten on the blackboard. The TEACHER yells, waving a birch rod in her hand. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tTEACHER  \n\t\tWell then?! Five times five \n\t\tequals...? \n\t\n\tCOLA stops to think a moment, then... \n\t\n\t\t\t\tCOLA  \n\t\tThirty!\n\t\n\tThe TEACHER grabs him by the purple ear and bashes his head against the numbers \n\ton the blackboard. A large thud echoes through the room, followed by a roar of \n\tlaughter. The TEACHER slams her rod on the desk.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tTEACHER  \n\t\tSilence!! \n\t\t\t(Then to COLA) \n\t\tThe five times table. Dunce! One \n\t\ttimes five, five!!\n\t\t\t(The class repeats with \n\t\t\tthe TEACHER, in a sing-\n\t\t\tsong chorus:)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tTEACHER and CLASS  \n\t\tTwo times five, ten! Three times \n\t\tfive, fifteen! Four times five, \n\t\ttwenty!\n\t\t\t(With a wave of the rod, \n\t\t\tthe TEACHER silences the \n\t\t\tclass, and finishes the \n\t\t\tsing-song with the fateful \n\t\t\tquestion.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tTEACHER  \n\t\tFive times five?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCOLA  \n\t\t\t(Timidly) \n\t\tForty...?\n\t\n\tAnother blow of the head on the blackboard. Hubbub.\n\tSlapping of the rod on the desk. SALVATORE secretly shows\n\tCOLA the picture of a Christmas tree on one page of the book,\n\tand mouths the word 'twenty-five'. COLA smiles, he has finally\n\tcaught on.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tTEACHER  \n\t\tI'm asking you for the last time, \n\t\tblockhead! Five times five equals...?\n\t\t\t(COLA turns to her with \n\t\t\tsmiling eyes and answers \n\t\t\tblissfully:)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCOLA  \n\t\tChristmas!!\n\t\n\tSALVATORE clutches his head in anger, watches the TEACHER\n\tflogging COLA on the back with the rod. COLA screams at every\n\tblow, and at every blow the laughter in the class grows louder.\n\tSALVATORE stares at the rod moving up and down rhythmically. But he is not \n\tthinking of the pain his schoolmate is feeling, but is drawn, rather, by that \n\tstrange regular beat, finds it similar to another regular beat, that of...\n\t\n\t11  CINEMA PARADISO. BALCONY AND MAIN FLOOR. INT. DAY\n\t\n\t...the rolling pin ALFREDO uses to flatten out a reel of film that has just \n\tbeen unloaded. SALVATORE carefully watches ALFREDO 5 every move. He is not in \n\tthe projection booth, but up in the balcony, standing on top of the last row of \n\tseats. He peers through the hole next to the lion's head. His bright little eyes \n\tfix in his mind the things ALFREDO does, as he loads the film into the \n\tprojector, shuts the fireproof housings, turns on the amplifier, checks the \n\tcarbons in the arc lamp, then lowers his head to have a look into the theatre \n\tand finds himself face to face with SALVATORE.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(Sternly) \n\t\tWhat are you doing here? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tI bought a ticket. I've come to see \n\t\tthe film.\n\t\t\t(Meanwhile the USHER comes \n\t\t\tup behind him and grabs \n\t\t\thim by the collar, and he \n\t\t\talmost jumps out of his \n\t\t\tskin. ALFREDO laughs.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tUSHER  \n\t\t\t(Yelling) \n\t\tGo sit downstairs! You good-for-\n\t\tnothing sponger! ! \n\t\t\t(To the audience) \n\t\tWorse than rabbits they are!\n\t\n\tSALVATORE has run downstairs. The main floor is more\n\tcrowded than the balcony, like every Sunday, and there is a greatdin. The BOY \n\tselling ice-cream, soda pop and candy shouts and\n\truns around like a chicken with its head off. Now the lights dim,\n\tthe hubbub dies down and the performance starts. Before the film\n\tthere is a preview for Stagecoach. The screen fills with images ofJohn Wayne, \n\tthe pursuit of the stagecoach by hostile Indians\n\tetc...\n\t\n\tSALVATORE is sitting in the front rows, right under the screen,\n\tnext to BOCCIA, COLA, MASINO, PEPPINO and OTHER KIDS, all with their noses in \n\tthe air. BOCCIA, the biggest show off of the group, is smoking a cigarette. An \n\tOLD MAN appears through the entrance curtain, takes a couple of steps and \n\tshouts:)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tFIRST OLD MAN  \n\t\tHello, everybody!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tAUDIENCE  \n\t\t\t(At once) \n\t\tSsssssh!!! Ssssssh! Silence!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tFIRST OLD MAN  \n\t\tCan't I say hello?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tUSHER  \n\t\tIt's a double-feature today.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tFIRST OLD MAN  \n\t\tI couldn't care less. I come here to \n\t\tsleep.\n\t\n\tAll at once, a chorus of shouts and whistles fills the theatre. Up\n\ton the screen, a globe of the world appears, spinning among the\n\tstars, the logo announcing the newsreel.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tAUDIENCE  \n\t\t\t(Hooting and whistling) \n\t\tFor Christ's sake! Cut it, \n\t\tAlfredoooo!\n\t\n\tThe CHILDREN in the front rows also yell, but SALVATORE goes\n\ton being alert. He turns and looks up at the holes of the projection\n\tbooth, as if it were an impregnable fortress. He watches the crazy\n\tdancing of light in the glowing stream that opens towards him in a\n\tcone. And besides, that lion's head, mysterious, almost gruesome,\n\temphasizes the enigmatic secret of the movies. In his dreamy eyes,\n\tthat lifeless lion seems to wake up with a ferocious roar.\n\t\n\tSALVATORE has a frightened look...Another lion roaring. But up on the screen. \n\tThe MGM lion. The throng of children imitate the famous growl all together, \n\tshaking their heads in unison.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCHILDREN  \n\t\tGrrrr! Grrrrr! \n\t\n\tThe film starts: it is Visconti's La terra trema. SALVATORE is in bliss. His \n\twide eyes looking up at the magic square of light. The title music. Another OLD \n\tMAN enters at the back of the theatre, but before sitting down, says hello in a \n\tloud voice.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSECOND OLD MAN  \n\t\tGreetings to one and all!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tAUDIENCE  \n\t\tSSSSSH' Drop dead! Silence! Hey, \n\t\tkids, we're here to see the film! \n\t\n\tNow there is an important sequence. The audience is silent. Concentrated on the \n\tscreen. BOCCIA passes the lighted cigarette to SALVATORE. He takes a puff and \n\thands it on to the others without ever taking his eyes off the screen. The \n\tbeautiful star of the film appears on screen. A different kind of attention \n\ttakes hold of the excited audience. SALVATORE and the others stare at her with \n\topen mouths...She leans towards the leading man, a languid expression, their \n\tprofiles touch. But all at once, just at the best part, there is a sudden jolt. \n\t\n\tThe kiss isn't seen.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tAUDIENCE  \n\t\t\t(Disappointed) \n\t\tAhhh! What a shame! I've been going \n\t\tto the movies for twenty years and I \n\t\tnever saw a kiss! \n\t\n\tSALVATORE is the only one to laugh to himself. He knows what has happened.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tAUDIENCE  \n\t\tAnd when will we see one? \n\t\n\tUp in the balcony, the audience is more sedate. The tickets cost more and the \n\tpeople are richer, more refined. Among them, a MAN with a moustache, the look of \n\ta public notary, is sitting right in front of the railing. Seriously, without \n\tbatting an eye, he spits down below with contempt. Right on the dot, a voice is \n\theard, followed by a chorus of protests.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tVOICE and AUDIENCE  \n\t\tBugger!!! Ssssh!!! Silence!!\n\t\n\t12  SQUARE AND ENTRANCE OF CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. NIGHT\n\t\n\tThe bell-tower rings midnight. The square is nearly deserted. Except\n\tfor a landowner near the refreshment stand, with a moustache and a\n\that, DON VINCENZO by name, who is picking out from a group of\n\tlabourers the men he'll be needing in the country at dawn. He chooses,\n\tpoints his finger, calls...\n\t\n\tPeople come out of the movie house after the last showing.\n\tThe USHER locks the front door as ALFREDO climbs down from the\n\tprojection booth. Among the crowd there is only one kid, SALVATORE.\n\tTired, half-asleep. He's seen all the showings. He starts to walk away\n\twhen he catches sight of his mother standing on the opposite corner,\n\twrapped in an old coat. She's waiting for him, in a temper.\n\tSALVATORE drops his eyes to the ground, mortified. He knows what's\n\tcoming. He goes over to her timidly, uncertain, gives her a questioning\n\tlook.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\tI've been looking for you all day. \n\t\tDid you buy the milk?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tNo...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\tThen where's the money?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tSomebody stole it.\n\t\n\tMARIA gives him a slap. SALVATORE holds back the sobs, but\n\this eyes brim with tears. ALFREDO and the USHER are nearby,\n\thave heard everything.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\tWhat'd you do with the money? Go to \n\t\tthe movies?\n\t\n\tSALVATORE nods his head and the sobs increase. MARIA, in\n\tdespair, flies off the handle, slaps him again, but looks as if she\n\tdoesn't really want to, as if deep down she forgives her son's\n\tescapade. ALFREDO catches on, speaks up on behalf of\n\tSALVATORE.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tSignora Maria, don't do that. He's \n\t\tjust a kid. \n\t\t\t(To SALVATORE) \n\t\tAnd why are you telling fibs? \n\t\t\t(To MARIA) \n\t\tWe let him in free. He must have lost \n\t\tthe money inside the movie\n\t\ttheatre...\n\t\t\t(SALVATORE stares at him \n\t\t\tin amazement, goes on \n\t\t\tlistening to him.)\n\t\tHow much did you have?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tFifty lire...\n\t\t\t(MARIA wipes away his tears.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(To the USHER) \n\t\tWhat you find tonight on the floor \n\t\tbetween the seats?\n\t\t\t(The USHER reaches into-\n\t\t\this pockets, pulls out \n\t\t\tsome odds and ends.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tUSHER  \n\t\tA comb, two heel-savers, a box of \n\t\ttobacco...\n\t\t\t(ALFREDO very skillfully \n\t\t\treaches out with fifty \n\t\t\tlire he has taken\n\t\t\tfrom his pocket. And like \n\t\t\ta magician he draws the \n\t\t\tmoney out of\n\t\t\tthe USHER'S hand.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO \n\t\t...and fifty lire! \n\t\t\t(To MARIA) \n\t\tSee?\n\t\t\t(He hands over the money \n\t\t\tunder the USHER'S \n\t\t\tastonished eyes.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\tThanks, Uncle Alfredo. Thanks. Good-\n\t\tnight.\n\t\n\tShe walks away, dragging SALVATORE by the hand. ALFREDO\n\tgives him a wink. SALVATORE smiles and winks back, but he's\n\tnot very good at it; he can't manage to shut only one eye.\n\tEverybody leaves and the square empties, as the VILLAGE IDIOT\n\tcomes up to the group of labourers, beside DON VINCENZO,\n\tmotioning them all to get moving.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tIDIOT  \n\t\tIt's midnight. I've got to shut down \n\t\tthe square! Go away.\n\t\tThe square's mine! The square's \n\t\tmine!!\n\t\n\t13  CEMETERY ROAD AND VILLAGE ROAD. EXT. DAY\n\t\n\tSALVATORE, dressed as an altar boy, walks alongside the PRIEST\n\twho is wearing the ceremonial vestments. They are tired, have walked\n\ta long way. Behind them a donkey pulls a wagon containing a little\n\twhite coffin and a bunch of flowers. Behind that a little procession  the\n\tparents and relatives of the dead child. The road is very wide, covered\n\twith white earth. The spring sun is dazzling. The funeral procession\n\tkicks up a cloud of dust that makes everything blurred and hazy, like a\n\tdream, rimmed around the horizon by the blue line of the sea. The\n\tprocession now turns into the large gate of the cemetery. ALFREDO,\n\tworking in the fields, takes his hat off and watches the coffin as it passes by.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCut to:\n\t\n\tThe funeral is over. The PRIEST and SALVATORE are walking back\n\tto the village. ALFREDO appears out of the countryside on e bicycle\n\twith a hoe and other farm tools in the basket. He comes pedaling up\n\tbeside them.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tGood morning, father. It's hard on \n\t\tthe feet, huh?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n\t\t\t(Breathless) \n\t\tYeah!...Getting there's downhill and \n\t\tall the saints help you. But coming \n\t\tback! The saints stand there watching \n\t\tyou, that's all! God's will be done.\n\t\n\tSALVATORE is about to open his mouth, wants to say something\n\tto ALFREDO, but he doesn't have time. ALFREDO pedals harder\n\tand rides off.\n\t\n\tSALVATORE is crestfallen. He looks et the PRIEST, then at the bicycle riding \n\taway. His eyes light up  an idea! He suddenly yells:\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tOuch! Ouch! My foot! I can't walk!\n\t\n\tHe limps. Throws himself to the ground as if a snake had bitten him. The PRIEST \n\tleans over in alarm. Up ahead in the distance, ALFREDO turns around to look.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCut to:\n\t\n\tThere is a smile on SALVATORE'S face. He is riding on the crossbar of ALFREDO's \n\tbicycle. On their way back lo the village.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tAlfredo, did you know my father?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tOf course I knew your father. He was \n\t\ttall, thin, pleasant, and had a \n\t\tmoustache like mine. Always smiling. \n\t\tHe looked like Clark Gable. \n\t\n\tThere's something SALVATORE wants to talk about, but he doesn't know how to \n\tstart. He has a try with an innocent stratagem.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tAlfredo, now that I'm older, I'm not \n\t\tsaying I can start coming to the \n\t\tprojection booth, to the movie \n\t\thouse...But...maybe, why don't we \n\t\tbecome friends? \n\t\n\tALFREDO knows exactly what the little rascal is up to, and answers in a \n\tstrange, theatrical tone, as if he were repeating something he knows by heart, a \n\tremark taken from some old film.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t'I choose my friends for their \n\t\tlooks, and my enemies for their \n\t\tbrains...' \n\t\t\t(Laughs) \n\t\tYou're too smart to be my friend. \n\t\tBesides, as I always tell my kids, be \n\t\tcareful to pick the right friends!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(Surprised) \n\t\tBut you don't have any kids!!!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(Spluttering) \n\t\tAll right, all right! When I've got \n\t\tkids that's what I'm telling them! \n\t\t\t(The outlying houses of \n\t\t\tGiancaldo finally heave \n\t\t\tinto sight.)\n\t\n\t14  SALVATORE S HOUSE. EXT. DAY\n\t\n\tLIA, SALVATORE'S kid sister, is crying outside the front door, terror\n\tstricken. Her face is smeared with smoke and her little dress half\n\tscorched and soaking wet. MARIA is distraught, damp with sweat, and\n\ttries to console her, hugging her in her arms.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\tStop crying...The fire is out...I'm \n\t\there...That'll do, that'll do...\n\t\t\t(ALFREDO and SALVATORE \n\t\t\tcome up behind them. \n\t\t\tSALVATORE has barely leapt \n\t\t\toff the bicycle when his \n\t\t\tmother sails into him like \n\t\t\ta fury, shrieking:)\n\t\tMiserable boy! You're the ruin of me! \n\t\tYour sister would have been burnt \n\t\talive if I hadn't been there! And all \n\t\tyour fault!\n\t\n\tSALVATORE darts off, chased by his mother, swift as a deer.\n\tALFREDO doesn't understand what has happened, leans over\n\tLIA, who goes on bawling her eyes out, and sees on the ground, in\n\tthe middle of the water, a flowery box all charred and still\n\tsmoking, and all around scraps of film reduced to ashes and\n\tseveral singed photographs, the photos of SALVATORE s father.\n\tALFREDO gets the message now, looks up at MARIA, who has\n\tcaught SALVATORE and is dragging him home, hitting and\n\tslapping him all the way. SALVATORE covers his head with his\n\thands to stave off the blows. MARIA turns to ALFREDO, in a\n\tstern, indignant voice.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA\n\t\tBut aren't you ashamed of yourself, \n\t\tUncle Alfredo, playing with a little \n\t\tboy at your age?!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(Cowed) \n\t\tBut...what's it got to do with \n\t\tme?...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\tAnd who gave him all those films? \n\t\tPromise you won't give him any more \n\t\tof this trash! Don't let him set foot \n\t\tany more in the movie house. The \n\t\tboy's crazy! Crazy! All he talks \n\t\tabout is movies and Alfredo' Alfredo \n\t\tand movies!! \n\t\n\tALFREDO is crestfallen, didn't think that SALVATORE'S craziness, his morbid \n\tpassion for movies, could go this far.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tI give you my word, Donna Maria. \n\t\t\t(MARIA now turns one last \n\t\t\ttime to her son.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\tGod's got to grant me one wish! Send \n\t\tyour father back home! And he'll see \n\t\tyou get what's coming to you! \n\t\t\t(SALVATORE lowers his \n\t\t\thands, looks at her and \n\t\t\twith the dreadful \n\t\t\tsincerity of children:)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tDaddy's not coming back...He's dead. \n\t\t\t(An icy flash runs through \n\t\t\tMARIA'S eyes.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\tIt's not true! No! It's not true!!! \n\t\tI'll show you he's coming back!\n\t\n\tAnd she beats him desperately, as if to enforce her stubborn hope, slap after \n\tslap. This time ALFREDO doesn't step in, lets MARIA give vent \n\tto her rage and fury, but SALVATORE'S cries make him feel guilty.\n\t\n\t15:SQUARE AND PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT/INT. DAY \n\t\n\tAnother Sunday. A crowd of men has gathered in the square around the café where \n\tthere is a loudspeaker. They are listening to the running commentary of the \n\tsoccer games. They check their Sisal pools coupons. NICOLO CAROSIO'S VOICE \n\t...We're at the seventh minute of the second half. Turin is leading one to \n\tzero. The goal was scored by...(The scene is seen from above, by ALFREDO who \n\tpeers out of the window of the projection booth. CAROSIO'S voice drowns out the \n\tsoundtrack of the film being shown. ALFREDO is bored. He goes over to the \n\tprojector, looks through the hole...It's the last sequence of the film. The \n\tmusic swells to a climax as 'THE END' appears on the screen. Swift as ever, \n\tALFREDO turns on the lights in the theatre' stops the projector. Looks back \n\tthrough the hole, to see...)\n\t\n\t16:CINEMA PARADISO. INT/EXT. DAY\n\t\n\t...the house packed to the rafters. Voices and laughter of the children. Smoke, \n\tice-cream, soft drinks. The USHER has opened the emergency exits to let in air. \n\tHe fights off the gate-crashers who are trying to get in free. The sound of the \n\tsports commentary fills the theatre. The village BLACKSMITH is sleeping in his \n\tseat, his head thrown back and his mouth wide open. The KIDS blow up the empty \n\tice-cream sacks and pop them next to his ears. Bang! The BLACKSMITH wakes up \n\twith a start, in a sea of laughter. He yells:  \n\t\n\t\t\t\tBLACKSMITH  \n\t\tAh! I'll wring all your necks!! Or my \n\t\tgood name means nothing! !! Lousy \n\t\tbrats! \n\t\n\tSALVATORE doesn't laugh. He is sad. He turns and looks up at the projection \n\tbooth. He sees ALFREDO through the lion's mouth. ALFREDO also catches sight of \n\thim. SALVATORE gives him a timid wave of the hand, as if asking if he can come \n\tup a moment. The look on ALFREDO'S face is unmistakable, irrevocable: N0! \n\tSALVATORE'S not surprised; after what happened it won't be easy to win him over. \n\tYet there must be some way. But what is it? As usual, SALVATORE is smart as the \n\tdevil when he's out to get something. Through the emergency exit he sees a woman \n\tpass by with a packet in her hand. It is ALFREDO's WIFE, and the packet is his \n\tsupper. SALVATORE leaps to his feet and runs out to her.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tSignora Anna!\n\t\n\t17  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION ROOM AND SQUARE. INT/EXT. DAY\n\t\n\tALFREDO starts up the projector. It's time for the documentaries and\n\tcartoons. SALVATORE peers in from the top of the stairs. He's scared of\n\tALFREDO'S reaction, but pricks up his courage and shows him the\n\tpacket. ALFREDO sees him, is about to pounce on him...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(On the defensive) \n\t\tYour wife told me to bring you this. \n\t\n\tHis expression betrays the 'put on'. ALFREDO sighs, realizes it's another one of \n\this little games.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(Sternly) \n\t\tGive it to me!...\n\t\n\tHe takes the packet, unwraps it and lifts the lid, shuts it again and puts the \n\tcontainer inside the lamp of the projector to keep it warm. SALVATORE hasn't \n\tmissed a single gesture, but speaks with his eyes \n\tto the poor.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tI told my mother you weren't the one \n\t\twho gave me the films. That it \n\t\twasn't your fault. But I thought you \n\t\tsaid the film could catch fire just \n\t\tto scare me. Now that I know, I won't \n\t\tsteal any more from you. That's all I \n\t\twanted to say. I'm going. \n\t\t\t(He turns to leave but \n\t\t\tALFREDO takes him by the \n\t\t\tshoulder and stops \n\t\t\thim.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tToto, come here. \n\t\n\tAll things considered, there is something in that little boy, maybe his \n\tfeverish passion, that strikes him. He'll talk to him seriously, without \n\tresorting to terrorism, try to convince him. He lowers the volume of the \n\tmonitor, sits down on the stool. SALVATORE raises his eyes from the floor and \n\tlooks at him at last...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tNow listen to what I've got to say. I \n\t\ttook up this profession when I \n\t\twas ten years old. In those days \n\t\tthere weren't these modern machines. \n\t\tThe films were silent. The projectors \n\t\twere run by hand, like this, with a \n\t\tcrank. And you wound the crank all \n\t\tday long. It was really rough going! \n\t\tIf you got tired and slowed down' \n\t\tboom! Everything would go up in \n\t\tflames!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tThen why don't you want to teach it \n\t\tto me too? Now that there's no more \n\t\tcranking, and it's easier?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(Firmly) \n\t\tBecause I don't want to, Toto! This \n\t\tis not a job for you. It's like being \n\t\ta slave. You're always alone. You see \n\t\tthe same film over and over again, \n\t\tbecause you have nothing else to do. \n\t\tAnd you start talking to Greta Garbo \n\t\tand Tyrone Power like a nut! You work \n\t\ton holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. \n\t\tOnly on Good Friday are you free. But \n\t\tif they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a \n\t\tcross...You'd work Good Fridays too! \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tThen why don't you change jobs? \n\t\t\t(ALFREDO sighs, irritated. \n\t\t\tHe reaches out to turn the \n\t\t\tknob of the carbon rods. \n\t\t\tHe gazes at SALVATORE as \n\t\t\tif he were a grown-up, \n\t\t\tsomebody who's making \n\t\t\tthings hard for him.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tBecause I'm an idiot. How many other \n\t\tguys in town know how to be a \n\t\tprojectionist? None! Only a jerk like \n\t\tme could do it. Besides I wasn't \n\t\tlucky. When I was a kid there was the \n\t\twar! When I grew up, another war! Now \n\t\tit's all different. Times have \n\t\tchanged. And you want to be a dope \n\t\tlike me? Huh? Answer me!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tNo...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tGood for you, Toto. Good for you...\n\t\tI'm only saying this for your own \n\t\tgood...\n\t\t\t(He gets up and, speaking \n\t\t\tall the while, goes into a \n\t\t\tcloset with a bucket \n\t\t\tin it, the toilet of the \n\t\t\tbooth. He turns his back \n\t\t\tand pees. )\n\t\tCooped up in here you die of heat in \n\t\tthe summer and of cold in the winter. \n\t\tYou breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and \n\t\tearn practically nothing. \n\t\t\t(SALVATORE listens to \n\t\t\thim, but taking advantage \n\t\t\tof the fact he can't be \n\t\t\tseen, he turns the knob of \n\t\t\tthe carbon rods, just as \n\t\t\the had seen done a moment \n\t\t\tbefore...)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(In a loud voice) \n\t\tBut don't you like anything about \n\t\twhat you do? \n\t\t\t(SALVATORE gazes at the \n\t\t\tphotos on the wall: \n\t\t\tKeaton, Garbo, Snow \n\t\t\tWhite.

The screen is \n\t\t\tblank. And down in the\n\t\t\ttheatre laughter is not \n\t\t\theard but an uproar of \n\t\t\twhistling and\n\t\t\tswearing. SALVATORE'S eyes \n\t\t\tsparkle, he seizes the \n\t\t\topportunity.\n\t\t\tHe turns on the lights and \n\t\t\tstops the projector, just \n\t\t\tas ALFREDO\n\t\t\twould have done. At which \n\t\t\tALFREDO buttons up his \n\t\t\tpants in a\n\t\t\thurry and rushes over \n\t\t\talarmed, but sees that \n\t\t\teverything is in order.\n\t\t\tSALVATORE looks at him all \n\t\t\tsmiles, as if he expected \n\t\t\ta medal for\n\t\t\tcivil bravery. Instead, \n\t\t\tALFREDO reacts like a wild \n\t\t\tanimal.)\n\t\tSo I've been wasting my breath? You \n\t\tpretend to agree with\n\t\tme, but as soon as my back is turned, \n\t\tyou do what you want!\n\t\t\t(He gives SALVATORE a kick \n\t\t\tin the ass, shrieking:)\n\t\tGet out of here!

SALVATORE suddenly\n\t\t\tvanishes, scared out of \n\t\t\this wits. ALFREDO talks to \n\t\t\thimself, in a\n\t\t\tfury:)\n\t\tBut how'd he do it? The little \n\t\tbastard! By watching, he's\n\t\tlearned! It's incredible!\n\t\t\t(He peers out of the \n\t\t\twindow, yelling, as he \n\t\t\tsees SALVATORE\n\t\t\trunning through the \n\t\t\tsquare. )\n\t\tI'm letting the box office know  \n\t\tyou're not to set foot even into\n\t\tthe theatre!

MORNING \n\t\n\tSummer has come. The village has a different look. The peddlers sing their \n\tmonotonous refrains in the village streets. In one street, women are busy \n\tcanning tomatoes. In one corner of the square, the SHEARER has finished clipping \n\tthe donkey and is now shaving the hair of a row of bare-chested URCHINS with \n\tnothing on but their underwear. Then another MAN disinfects them by spraying \n\tthem with the hand pumps used to spray trees in the country. The URCHINS \n\tlaugh. The BILL-POSTER is hanging up the posters of a new film, 'TODAY AT CINEMA\n\tPARADISO .\n\t\n\t20  GRADE SCHOOL DINING HALL. INT. MORNING \n\t\n\tThe fifth-grade exams. In the vast dining hall all the children are seated, one \n\tfor each desk, under the watchful eyes of the teachers. SALVATORE, BOCCIA, \n\tPEPPINO, MASINO and COLA have taken places here and there, as nervous as \n\teverybody else. The EXAMINING BOARD MEMBER is dictating the text of the \n\tarithmetic problem. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tEXAMINING BOARD MEMBER  \n\t\tA merchant owns two stores. In the \n\t\tfirst he sells fruit and vegetables. \n\t\tIn the second he sells nails and \n\t\tcement...\n\t\t\t(The PRINCIPAL comes in, \n\t\t\tinterrupts the dictation.) \n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRINCIPAL  \n\t\tExcuse me, professor. Here are the \n\t\tmen taking the exam for the \n\t\telementary school certificate. \n\t\t\t(Turning to the door) \n\t\tCome in, please...\n\t\t\t(All the children turn to \n\t\t\tlook. A MAN around thirty \n\t\t\tenters, ill at ease. The \n\t\t\tchildren recognize him and \n\t\t\tlaugh mischievously. The \n\t\t\tsecond is the BLACKSMITH, \n\t\t\tthe one who falls asleep \n\t\t\tat the movies. The third \n\t\t\tis a twenty-year-old-boy, \n\t\t\tANGELO. The fourth is \n\t\t\tALFREDO, embarrassed and \n\t\t\tred in the face. SALVATORE \n\t\t\tis speechless. Gives a \n\t\t\tslightly ironic laugh. \n\t\t\tThere is a look of revenge \n\t\t\tin his shrewd little \n\t\t\teyes.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCut to:\n\t\n\tThe assignment is now being carried out. There is dead silence in the \n\thall. \n\t\n\tTEACHERS and the PRINCIPAL moue about, checking to be sure there are no notes \n\tbeing handed around or other forms of 'collaboration'. The four outsiders are \n\thaving a hard time. It can be seen on their faces. ALFREDO is also in trouble, \n\tdoesn't know how to solve the problem, the calculations are too diff cult. He \n\tlooks at the desk next to him, where SALVATORE is sitting. SALVATORE is about to \n\tlook up at him, but ALFREDO immediately looks away, too proud to let himself be \n\tseen. \n\t\n\tThe exchange of glances continues, grotesque, almost comical. SALVATORE \n\tmeanwhile writes down numbers and operations quite quickly. ALFREDO can't stand \n\tit any longer, is nervous, beaded with sweat. He's sorry he ever showed up. \n\tSALVATORE laughs up his sleeve, now he has the upper hand. ALFREDO tries \n\tsneaking a look at his exercise book in order to copy something. But SALVATORE \n\tturns his back, hiding it from sight. ALFREDO tries sneaking a look at somebody \n\telse's exercise book, but the damn kid also covers it. It looks like a \n\tconspiracy against him. ALFREDO has no way out. He has to accept the idea of \n\teating humble pie. He looks at SALVATORE, motions him with his eyes in a \n\tconversation of glances. He asks for help, but SALVATORE stands firm, \n\timplacable. \n\t\n\tALFREDO tries to put it into words in a low voice.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO \n\t\tYOU jerk. Tell me how to solve this \n\t\tfucking problem! \n\t\n\t\t\t\tTEACHER  \n\t\tSsssh! Silence back there!! \n\t\n\tALFREDO insists with his eyes. SALVATORE makes him understand with gestures \n\tthat he could help him maybe, but...on one condition. He imitates the gesture \n\tof winding the crank of the projector. ALFREDO gets the message. It's pure \n\tblackmail. He rubs his hand over his sweating face, raises his eyes to the \n\tceiling as if he were swearing. Then he surrenders, accepts the condition. \n\tSALVATORE is serious, does not flaunt his victory, but you can tell he is happy. \n\tHe takes out a sheet of paper he had already prepared, with the solution to the \n\tproblem, rolls it up into a tiny ball and as soon as the TEACHER passes by, \n\ttakes aim and flicks it to him. ALFREDO'S hand catches the precious and dearly \n\tbought message in mid-air. Their quarrel is over.\n\t\n\t2I  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT. DAY/EVENING\n\t\n\tA bright, lilting tune marks the rhythm of the quick, blurred images, as\n\tin a dance, the images of ALFREDO teaching SALVATORE all the\n\tsecrets of the projectionist trade.\n\t\n\tALFREDO slips the reel on to the projector, unrolls the trailer and hands\n\tit to SALVATORE. SALVATORE mounts the film on the sprockets.\n\tNow SALVATORE sets the projector into motion, opens the shutter and\n\tstands on tip-toe to see the screen from the hole...\n\t\n\tA shot from In nome della legge. The main-floor audience applauds a\n\tline spoken by Massimo Gironi. And from the balcony, the same little\n\tMAN with the face of a public notary spits below.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMAIN FLOOR VOICE  \n\t\tBastard!! Pencil-pusher!!\n\t\n\tALFREDO shows SALVATORE the running of the film. He points\n\tto a place on the projector.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tPay attention. This is where it can \n\t\teasily catch fire. If it\n\t\thappens, the first thing you've got \n\t\tto do is break it off, here\n\t\tand here, so the whole reel doesn't \n\t\tgo up in fames.\n\t\n\tOn the screen, a shot from Riso amaro. A kiss. Unrelenting, the PRIEST rings his \n\tbell. SALVATORE licks the film on one side, then on the other. He laughs.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO \n\t\tYou understand which side the \n\t\tgelatin's on?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tIt tastes wonderful!\n\t\n\tA shot of Amedeo Nazzari in La figlia del capitano. A jump,\n\tan out-of-rack frame. The audience whistles.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tAUDIENCE  \n\t\tFraaaame!! Wake up, Alfredo!\n\t\t\t(SALVATORE tries to do a \n\t\t\thand-binding. ALFREDO \n\t\t\twinds the film, hangs a \n\t\t\tslip on a nail in the \n\t\t\twall.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tThese are the shipping invoices for \n\t\tthe film. They are always to be kept. \n\t\tYou see?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tOK, Alfredo.\n\t\n\tDown on the main floor, a scene from Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.\n\tEveryone screams and hides their faces when Hyde looks at the\n\tcamera.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tAUDIENCE  \n\t\tHoly Mother! What a face! So ugly!\n\t\n\tOne young man, ANGELO, doesn't hide his face. He looks up at\n\ta young woman, ROSA, in the balcony, who turns and smiles at\n\thim.\n\t\n\tALFREDO gives SALVATORE a wooden stool. He's had it made especially for him, so \n\the can be high enough to reach the reels of the projector and the arc lamp. \n\tSALVATORE climbs up on it. He laughs, all excited. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tNow you can run it by yourself. \n\t\n\tSALVATORE gives another smile. He is posing in a photographer's studio . He is \n\tall dressed up for first communion, holding a white lily. The flash goes off \n\tlike lightning during a storm. Now SALVATORE is posing next to his mother and \n\tlittle sister. They smile without hugging. Another flash of light. Click!\n\t\n\t22  FIFTH GRADE. INT. DAY\n\t\n\tAnother click. The transparency of Rita Hayworth in her black gown\n\tfrom Gilda.

The pupils are all standing around the\n\tteacher's desk, having received their end-of-the-year report cards.\n\tPEPPINO, who shared SALVATORE s desk, is saying goodbye to\n\this schoolmates. BOCCIA, COLA, the others. They have serious,\n\tsad expressions. He and SALVATORE kiss like grown-ups. The\n\tTEACHER is standing among them. One of the schoolmates does\n\tnot respond lo PEPPINO's goodbye gesture. He takes a few steps\n\tback, serious, scared, his eyes lowered.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tTEACHER  \n\t\tDi Francesco, aren't you saying \n\t\tgoodbye to your schoolmate?\n\t\t\t(DI FRANCESCO gives his \n\t\t\thead a little shake.

The \n\tcardboard suitcases tied with string are loaded on to the luggage rack of the \n\tblack car. The scene is watched by SALVATORE and ALFREDO, up in the window of \n\tthe projection booth. They look like old friends. On the sound monitor, the \n\tstrains of some American musical comedy tune. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tWill they really find work in \n\t\tGermany? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tWho knows?...It's like an adventure. \n\t\t\t(In a theatrical voice) \n\t\tHope springs eternal...\n\t\t\t(PEPPINO from the distance \n\t\t\tgives one last wave at the \n\t\t\twindow of the \n\t\t\tprojection booth. \n\t\t\tSALVATORE waves back.) \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tPeppinoooo!

SALVATORE \n\t\t\twatches the car drive off. \n\t\t\tHe mumbles:) \n\t\tGood thing Germany's closer than \n\t\tRussia. \n\t\n\tALFREDO rubs his hand through his hair.\n\t\n\t24  CINEMA PARADISO. BALCONY AND BOOTH. INT. EVENING\n\t\n\tThe lion's head with the beam of light, seen from the balcony.\n\tSALVATORE'S face appears in the hole beside it, as he peers down at the\n\timages of the Settimana Incom newsreel.\n\tThe audience is distracted. The snoring of a man sleeping can be heard.\n\tA pair of urchins pick up a cockroach with their hands, tip-toe down the\n\taisle. The sleeping man is the same old BLACKSMITH, with his head\n\tthrown back. A little hand drops the cockroach into the gaping mouth.\n\tThe URCHINS take to their heels. The BLACKSMITH squirms, wake up\n\twith a start. Spits, while everybody laughs. The newsreel is now about\n\tmissing soldiers in Russia.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCOMMENTATOR  \n\t\tThe Defense Minister has announced a \n\t\tnew listof names of Italian soldiers, \n\t\tso far considered missing and now\n\t\tconfirmed as dead. Families concerned \n\t\twill be notified directly by military \n\t\tauthorities.\n\t\n\tSALVATORE pays careful attention, sees the black-and-white\n\tshots of the last war. The Russian campaign. The troops in the\n\tsnow. Now in detail a heap of personal objects found on the\n\tcorpses. Documents, clothing, glasses, photographs. One quick\n\tdetail catches SALVATORE's eye  among those photographs, for one\n\tinstant he sees one he thinks he recognizes. He quickly sticks a slip of paper \n\tinto the take-up reel, as when marking the kisses to be cut.\n\t\n\t25  PREFECTURE. CITY. INT.

And a lump in her throat prevents her from speaking. She\n\tlooks at her husband's belongings, identifies them  a gold chain, an ID\n\tcard and the photograph, the one SALVATORE saw in the newsreel.\n\tMARIA strokes it with her fingers. SALVATORE comes up and looks, as\n\tthe OFFICIAL concludes:\n\t\n\t\t\t\tOFFICIAL \n\t\t...Unfortunately we don't know what \n\t\twar cemetery he's buried in...This \n\t\tis the form for the pension.

SALVATORE presses close and puts his arm around her waist. \n\tThey turn the corner, and walk off in the noisy city, disfigured by the ruins of \n\twar.

The aisles are crammed, an the \n\tway down to the screen, where grown-ups and children sit on the floor, their \n\tnoses in the air. Some people munch crusts of bread they've brought along from \n\thome. Almost everybody is smoking. A woman laughs, holding the baby she is \n\tnursing. In one corner, at the end of one of the aisles jammed with people \n\tstanding, a girl laughs, but every now and then her expression reveals a look of \n\tdeep pleasure. \n\t\n\tHer body moves slightly. Clinging to her from the rear is a man bathed in sweat. \n\t\n\tThey are making love standing there among the crowd, which notices nothing and \n\tgoes on laughing.\n\t\n\tIn the balcony ANGELO is holding hands with ROSA.\n\tThe curtain over the entrance is open. People are also standing there,\n\tseeing what they can from the distance, even a corner of the screen\n\tthrough the forest of heads. But the line continues on outside...All the\n\tway to the entrance of the movie house, out in the square. There are\n\tcrowds of people, shivering from the cold, who protest, shove, risk\n\tprovoking incidents. The PRIEST, Father Adelfio, is exhausted, tries to\n\tcalm them down.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n\t\tDon't shove! There's no room! For \n\t\theaven's sake! I can't\n\t\tgive another showing, it's late!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tVOICES IN CROWD  \n\t\tFather Adelfio, we've been here for \n\t\tan hour! There are people inside \n\t\twho've seen it twice! ! ! Move on!!\n\t\tOuch!! My foot!!!\n\t\n\tIt has just stopped raining, the bell-tower rings eleven o'clock. On\n\tthe poster of the film a ' LAST DAY' sticker. The PRIEST, the\n\tTICKET-SELLER, the USHER and TWO CARABINIERES push the crowd back, close the \n\tfront door. The protest grows louder. Fists pound the door.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCROWD  \n\t\tOpen up!!! Father Adelfio!!\n\t\t\t(The audience in the \n\t\t\ttheatre hears the uproar. \n\t\t\tReacts:)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tAUDIENCE  \n\t\tSsssh! Sssssh! Be quiet out there!! \n\t\tWhat the hell!\n\t\t\t(From the window of the \n\t\t\tprojection booth, ALFREDO \n\t\t\tand SALVATORE look at the \n\t\t\tcrowd down below, yelling \n\t\t\tand complaining. Some of \n\t\t\tthe people look up at \n\t\t\tthem. )\n\t\n\t\t\t\tVOICES IN CROWD  \n\t\tAlfredooo! We want to get in!...\n\t\tTomorrow you're taking it off!\n\t\t\t(ALFREDO spreads his arms \n\t\t\tout as if to say there s \n\t\t\tnothing he can do.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tWhy can't we show the same film \n\t\ttomorrow?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tIt's got to be sent to another town. \n\t\tAnd if we don't the owner of that \n\t\tmovie house gets pissed off.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tToo bad!\n\t\n\tThe crowd sways nervously. The CARABINIERES give order.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCARABINIERES  \n\t\t\t(Exasperated) \n\t\tStop! Go home, all of you! Otherwise \n\t\tsomebody's going to end up in jail!' \n\t\tThat's enough!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(Dramatically) \n\t\t'Joe! A mob doesn't think, doesn't \n\t\tknow what it's doing...'\n\t\t\t(SALVATORE gives him a \n\t\t\tcurious, inquisitive look. \n\t\t\tALFREDO smiles.)\n\t\tSpencer Tracy said it in Fury. \n\t\t\t(Mischievously) \n\t\tWhat'd you say if we let these poor \n\t\tdevils see the film, Toto? \n\t\t\t(SALVATORE stares at him \n\t\t\tin amazement, all \n\t\t\texcited.) \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tWonderful! But how can it be done? \n\t\n\tALFREDO turns away from the window. He gives a smirk, imitates the tough \n\tAmerican movie stars.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tYou don't believe my words, but \n\t\tyou'll have to believe your own \n\t\teyes!...And now get your ass off \n\t\tthat damn stool, boy! \n\t\n\tSALVATORE laughs, eagerly, as if he were about to see a whole new movie. He \n\tclimbs off the stool. Both of them move towards the projector...\n\t\n\t28  PROJECTION BOOTH AND SQUARE. INT/EXT. EVENING\n\t\n\tTrying not to put his hand in front of the lens, ALFREDO removes the\n\tframe with the glass that protects the projection. He wheels it around\n\tand motions SALVATORE to look...On the wall behind the projector:\n\tthe film picture appears gradually, reflected by the glass, moves as the\n\tglass moves all the way over to the window looking out over the square.\n\tThere it disappears. SALVATORE can barely believe his eyes, as if it\n\twere a piece of magic. He takes a quick look through the hole to see if\n\tthe film is still showing on the screen. It is.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(Mysteriously) \n\t\tGo to the window, boy, and have a \n\t\tlook...\n\t\n\tSALVATORE goes over to the window. Looks out. The reflected\n\tbeam of light ends up on the white row of houses facing the\n\tsquare. It's like another screen. Except the images are\n\tbackwards, like when you look in a mirror. And here and there\n\tare the windows of the houses...For SALVATORE, it's a\n\twonderful spectacle, like a dream, ravishing.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tAlfredo, it's beautiful.\n\t\t\t(A voice is heard in the \n\t\t\tcrowd of people jammed \n\t\t\taround the entrance to the \n\t\t\tmovie house.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tVOICE IN CROWD  \n\t\t\t(Shouting) \n\t\tHey, look there!! The movie!!\n\t\t\t(All heeds turn to look at \n\t\t\tthe house behind them.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCROWD  \n\t\tOh, praise the Lord!! It's true! \n\t\tLook! The movie!! There's Toto!! \n\t\tHurry! Hurry!...THANKS, ALFRED0000!!\n\t\n\tAnd everybody runs over to the other side of the square, in front\n\tof the strange new screen. ALFREDO and SALVATORE watch with glittering eyes. \n\tSALVATORE lays his hand on the shoulder of his great pal.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tGood for you, Alfredo! \n\t\n\tA close-up of Toto projected on the houses, and one of the windows opens. A MAN \n\tappears, in his pajamas. Dazzled by the light, he shades his eyes with his hand. \n\tHe sees all those people looking at him and laughing together.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCROWD  \n\t\tShut the window!! Shut the window! Go \n\t\tto bed!! \n\t\n\tThe MAN is dazed. Doesn't now what's going on. Looks around, and sees the \n\tblack-and-white figures of the film dancing around him. He pops back inside, \n\tslams the window shut, almost cared.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tVOICES IN CROWD  \n\t\t\t(To ALFREDO) \n\t\tSound!!! Sound!! Alfredooooo!!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tWhat do you say, should we make them \n\t\thappy?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(Smiling) \n\t\tSure, sure! \n\t\n\tALFREDO takes the loudspeaker of the monitor, rings it over to the window, \n\tturns it around towards the square. He turns up he volume and the sound-track \n\tfills the square. A chorus of approval.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCROWD  \n\t\tAaaaaaaa! At last!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(Looking at SALVATORE) \n\t\tDo you want to go down there? \n\t\t\t(SALVATORE gives a \n\t\t\tcontented nod.) \n\t\tGo on. \n\t\n\tSALVATORE runs on. ALFREDO looks wistfully towards the huge image in the \n\tsquare. Down in the square SALVATORE heads for the crowd, his eyes trained on \n\tthe house-front screen. Behind him, the door of the movie house opens. The \n\tPRIEST, Father Adelfio, sees the film being projected on the house front, \n\tthe people standing or sitting on the ground, laughing. His eyes nearly pop out \n\tof his head. Then he motions over the TICKET-SELLER, whispers something into his \n\tear. The TICKET-SELLER strides over to the shivering spectators, pulls the pad \n\tof tickets out of his pocket.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tTICKET-SELLER  \n\t\tLadies and gentlemen! You have to buy \n\t\ttickets! Reduced rate! \n\t\n\tAn irresistible chorus of Bronx cheers washes over him. SALVATORE looks around, \n\thighly amused.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tCROWD  \n\t\tFuck off!! The square belongs to \n\t\teverybody! \n\t\t\t(The VILLAGE IDIOT peers \n\t\t\tOut Of the crowd, all \n\t\t\tworked up.) \n\t\n\t\t\t\tVILLAGE IDIOT  \n\t\tNo!!! The square's mine!!! Come on, \n\t\tkids, no joking around here!!! \n\t\tOtherwise...\n\t\n\tThe crowd roars with laughter. SALVATORE laughs too, as if carried away by it \n\tall. And over the general merriment looms the shadow of ALFREDO, standing in the \n\twindow of the projection booth. All at once, on the house-front screen, the \n\timage of Toto slows down for an instant, a white blister appears and spreads \n\tuntil it fills the whole screen. The crowd gives a start of bewilderment and \n\tfear. SALVATORE jerks his head around to look at the booth.\n\t\n\t29  PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY \n\t\n\tThe film bursts violently into flame among the gears and sprockets of the \n\tprojector. ALFREDO is taken off-guard. He breaks the film running into the take-\n\tup reel, but is unable to do it for the delivery reel. He grabs the film which \n\tis catching fire and pulls it out quickly, tries to stop the flames from \n\treaching the reel in the f reproof housing. A desperate race against the speed \n\tof the fire. The flames on the floor burn his legs. ALFREDO gives a jump, slows \n\tdown the movement of his hands for an instant and inevitably the flames run \n\tahead, reach the upper housing. It's like an explosion. The flames leap out, \n\tstriking him full in the face. ALFREDO doesn't have time to scream, struggles \n\tdesperately and falls to the floor. Meanwhile the flames envelop everything.\n\t\n\t30  SQUARE.EXT.EVENING \n\t\n\tThe flash of the flames flares up in the windows of the projection booth. \n\tSALVATORE is appalled, elbows his way through the moving \n\tcrowd. Inside the movie house the murmuring of the audience can be heard, \n\tgrowing louder and louder. A scream...\n\t\n\t3I:CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING \n\t\n\tA violent spurt of flames leaps out of the mouth of the plaster lion's head, \n\tinto the darkness broken by the screams of people rushing for the exits.\n\t\n\t32  SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO ENTRANCE. EXT. EVENING \n\t\n\tThe crowd streaks out of the movie house, enveloped in a cloud of black smoke. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tCROWD  \n\t\tHeeeelp! Run for your lives!!! \n\t\n\tIn the general panic, SALVATORE tries in vain to get inside, elbows his way \n\ttowards the street with the stairs leading to the projection booth. The audience \n\tclashes against him, knocks him to the ground, almost trampling him underfoot. \n\tHe is suddenly seized by a superhuman force; gets up, claws his way desperately \n\tahead, with people falling on top of him and to the floor. He finally succeeds, \n\tstarts up the stairs...\n\t\n\t33  CINEMA PARADISO. STAIRS AND PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. EVENING \n\t\n\tThe place is filled with smoke. The air is suffocating. SALVATORE streaks up the \n\tstairs, gasping for breath. The projection booth is enveloped inflames. \n\tALFREDO's body on the floor, burning. SALVATORE moves quickly, throws a blanket \n\tover his shoulders, drags him by the feet over to the stairs, as boxes and other \n\tobjects fall on him. Using the same blanket, he stamps out the flames that have \n\tseared ALFREDO'S clothes. With the force of desperation, he drags him further \n\tdown the stairs which have been reached by the smoke but not by the flames. \n\tALFREDO doesn't move, his face is burnt. SALVATORE looks at him and only now is \n\tpanic-stricken, lets out a terrified shriek, like a wounded colt. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tAlfredo! Heeeelp! Help!!!\n\t\n\t34  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING \n\t\n\tThe plaster lion looks like a dragon spitting fire and smoke. The statue of the \n\tVirgin Mary is also in flames. And the movie screen.\n\t\n\t35  SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. EVENING \n\t\n\tThe fire has been put out. Nothing remains of the movie house but the skeleton. \n\tEverything has gone up in smoke. \n\t\n\tPeople stand around, dismayed. They gather around the PRIEST, who is at once \n\tgrieved and shocked, to express their solidarity and comfort. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tVOICES  \n\t\tWhat a pity! Poor Alfredo! What a \n\t\tterrible thing!! Cheer up, Father, is \n\t\tthere something we can do?'\n\t\n\t\t\t\tVILLAGE IDIOT  \n\t\t\t(Laughing) \n\t\tBurnt up...Burnt up. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n\t\tWhat'll we do now! The town will have \n\t\tto get along without movies! Who's \n\t\tgot the money to rebuild it? \n\t\n\tCICCIO SPACCAFICO, the man who won the Sisal pools, comes up, dressed in style. \n\tHe looks up at the charred cinema. It looks like a battlefield after an enemy \n\tattack. From the smoke and ashes to...\n\t\n\t36  CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. EVENING\n\t\n\t...The great lighted sign of the CINEMA PARADISO . The movie house has been \n\trebuilt. New facade. New billboards. There are people \n\tmoving about the entrance. It is the evening of the inauguration...\n\t\n\t37  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING \n\t\n\tThe lobby is crowded with people, authorities, special guests. There is the \n\tMAYOR, FATHER ADELFIO and the new owner, CICCIO SPACCAFICO, dressed to the \n\tteeth. The MAYOR cuts the ribbon. Flashbulbs pop. Clapping. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tGUESTS  \n\t\tCheers' Congratulations, Don Ciccio! \n\t\n\tThe procession advances towards the stairs leading into the theatre. FATHER \n\tADELFIO, with a nostalgic sigh, blesses the lobby, then the corridor. Lastly, \n\tthe new auditorium, which resounds with toasts and cheers.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tAUDIENCE  \n\t\tTo the Cinema Paradiso! \n\t\n\tThe PRIEST sprinkles the new seats, the walls, the screen with holy water...\n\t\n\t38  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. EVENING \n\t\n\tNow FATHER ADELFIO is blessing the brand-new projection booth. He also blesses \n\tthe new projectionist: SALVATORE. He is very nervous, but serious, self-\n\tpossessed. His worried-looking mother is also there for the occasion. The PRIEST \n\tturns to SPACCAFICO. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n\t\tHow'd you solve his being under age? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSPACCAFICO  \n\t\tI took out a license as \n\t\tprojectionist, thanks to friends down \n\t\tat the guild offices. But I don't \n\t\tknow a thing about it. Officially, I \n\t\tdo the job...\n\t\t\t(Smiling at Salvatore)\n\t\t...but Toto earns the money. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n\t\tFine. \n\t\t\t(To SALVATORE) \n\t\tAlways be careful, my boy. Don't ever \n\t\tgo to sleep. Be sure another accident \n\t\tdoesn't happen. Do everything poor \n\t\tAlfredo taught you. And may God bless \n\t\tyou. \n\t\n\tSALVATORE nods his head seriously, assuming a responsible expression. His \n\tmother kisses the PRIEST's hand.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\tThanks, Father. Thanks. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSPACCAFICO  \n\t\tAnd now enough of this gloomy \n\t\tatmosphere. Life goes on! I want to \n\t\tsee you happy and smiling!\n\t\n\t39  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING\n\t\n\tLaughter. The laughter of the large audience at the first showing of the\n\tinauguration film. Among the spectators, SALVATORE'S mother, MARIA, and his kid \n\tsister, El A. Up on the screen, a man and a woman kiss. The first time a kiss \n\thas been seen at the Cinema Paradiso. The audience murmurs, surprised and \n\texcited.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tAUDIENCE  \n\t\tOoooooh! They're kissing!! Look at \n\t\tthat!! Christ, that's news!!\n\t\n\tAn OLD LADY sitting next to the MAYOR, crosses herself, flabbergasted. CICCIO \n\tSPACCAFICO chuckles. Rubs his hands: these are going to be golden times for him. \n\tFATHER ADELFIO gets up and stalks out of the theatre, indignant; he'll\n\tnever set foot in the place again. The love theme gets louder and\n\tlouder...\n\t\n\t40  PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. EVENING\n\t\n\tThe same music spreads through the booth from the monitor. SALVATORE is by \n\thimself. He is watching the film through the hole but strangely enough, the \n\tstory doesn't absorb him. ALFREDO'S absence makes him nervous, he gazes at the \n\tstool he used to sit on. Il has been repainted. A voice from the rear of the \n\tcabin:\n\t\n\t\t\t\tANNA'S VOICE  \n\t\tToto?...\n\t\n\tSALVATORE turns and at the top of the stairs sees SIGNORA\n\tANNA and behind her, ALFREDO, her husband. He is wearing a\n\tpair of dark glasses and walks with the kelp of a cane. He has\n\tlost his sight, but not his spirit. He smiles:\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tAny room for me in this Cinema \n\t\tParadiso?\n\t\t\t(SALVATORE runs over and \n\t\t\tembraces him.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tCome in, Alfredo.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tANNA  \n\t\t\t(to SALVATORE) \n\t\tToto, will you bring him home when \n\t\tyou close down?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tYes. Signora Anna. \n\t\t\t(To ALFREDO) \n\t\tI'm glad you came.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCut to:\n\t\n\tALFREDO is now sitting there immobile. He listens to the soundtrack of the film. \n\tSALVATORE studies the way he stares into empty space, and the idea of darkness \n\tfrightens him. There is something new in ALFREDO'S manner, as if having grazed \n\tdeath and the loss of his sight had endowed him with a deeper knowledge of men \n\tand life.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tHow's school?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tOK. OK. But now that I've got a job, \n\t\tI'11 probably stop going...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tDon't do that...Sooner or later \n\t\tyou'll be left empty-handed.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tWhy? What do you mean?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tToto, this isn't for you. For the \n\t\tmoment, the Cinema Paradiso needs \n\t\tyou, and you need the Cinema \n\t\tParadiso. But it won't last...Some \n\t\tday you'll have other things \n\t\tto do, more important things...\n\t\t\t(He reaches out and \n\t\t\ttouches SALVATORE'S face \n\t\t\tto 'feel' his expression.)\n\t\tThat's right, more important. I know \n\t\tit. Now that I've lost my sight I see \n\t\tmore. \n\t\tI see everything I didn't see \n\t\tbefore...\n\t\t\t(As ALFREDO moves his hand \n\t\t\tfrom SALVATORE's face, we \n\t\t\tsee that he is now a young \n\t\t\tman, and that ALFREDO is \n\t\t\tolder, grayer.) \n\t\tAnd it's all thanks to you, who saved \n\t\tmy life. And I'll never forget it...\n\t\t\t(SALVATORE doesn't \n\t\t\tunderstand his strange \n\t\t\twords. ALFREDO can 'feel' \n\t\t\the is troubled.)\n\t\tAnd don't put on that look. I haven't \n\t\tgone off my head yet. You want proof?\n\t\n\tAnd he gives a joking smile. SALVATORE is curious, expects one of his fiendish \n\ttricks.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(Smiling) \n\t\tYes. I want proof.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tFor example, at this moment the \n\t\tfilm's out of focus. Go see. \n\t\n\tSALVATORE stands up in disbelief. He looks through the hole, and indeed the film \n\tis out of focus. He puts it back into focus, flabbergasted.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(Smiling) \n\t\tIt's hard to explain, Toto...\n\t\n\t41  CAFE IN THE SQUARE. INT/EXT. MORNING\n\t\n\tAs the BILL-POSTER attaches to the café door a poster of Catene - the\n\tcoming attraction at the Cinema Paradiso - CICCIO SPACCAFICO is\n\tspeaking on the phone in the phone booth. He is clearly peeved.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSPACCAFICO  \n\t\tOnly two days? Are you joking?!...\n\t\tWhat do I care if all the copies \n\t\tare reserved?...Catene for only two \n\t\tdays in a place like this! Why, \n\t\tpeople will eat me alive!...\n\t\t\t(Standing beside him \n\t\t\tlistening is SALVATORE. He \n\t\t\tis carrying school \n\t\t\tbooks under his ann. In \n\t\t\tthe café, several curious \n\t\t\tONLOOKERS laugh as through \n\t\t\tthe café window they watch \n\t\t\tsome unemployed PEASANT \n\t\t\tMEN dancing together at \n\t\t\tthe club. SPACCAFICO \n\t\t\tlistens nervously, then \n\t\t\tshrieks as if he were \n\t\t\tabout to eat the phone.)\n\t\t...I know, I know. But even if I \n\t\tstart showing at eight in the morning \n\t\tit wouldn't be enough! This is a big \n\t\ttown now and you people at the \n\t\tTitanus know it perfectly well! I'm \n\t\tyour sole agent and if I get pissed \n\t\toff I'll write straight \n\t\tto Lombardo, in Rome!! I'll give you \n\t\tguys a good run-around!! If I get my \n\t\tdander up, I can let fly, if my \n\t\tname's Spaccafico!! \n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCut to:  \n\t\n\tSPACCAFICO AND SALVATORE are now outside the café, head towards the square. In \n\tfront of the movie house, the CHARWOMAN is at work. SPACCAFICO is so nervous he \n\tlights two cigarettes without noticing it. SALVATORE is turning something over \n\tin his mind.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tDon Ciccio, I've got an idea...You \n\t\tremember that old abandoned movie \n\t\thouse where they're supposed to build \n\t\tthose low-rent houses?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSPACCAFICO  \n\t\tSo what's that got to do with it?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tThe projector's all rusty, but I \n\t\tcould fix it in two or three days. \n\t\tGive the place a good cleaning, put \n\t\tin some seats and bring in a \n\t\tprojectionist and we'll show Catene \n\t\tin two houses.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSPACCAFICO  \n\t\t\t(Shrieking) \n\t\tWhat the fuck you talking about? You \n\t\tgetting into the act too, Toto? \n\t\tTitanus has trouble giving me even \n\t\tone copy and I have to say thanks! If \n\t\tI ask for two, the least they'll do \n\t\tis cut off my head and play ball with \n\t\tit! \n\t\n\tA shrewd look glitters in SALVATORE s eyes. He smiles.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tWho says we need two copies?\n\t\n\t42  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY \n\t\n\tThe house is jammed with people. Almost bursting at the seams. The last scenes \n\tof Catene move across the screen. Tears stream down the faces of the men and \n\twomen. The children are unusually silent. Even the BLACKSMITH is awake, indeed \n\twhispers ahead of time all the lines of Nazzari and Yvonne Sanson, knows them by \n\theart. Among the crowd in the balcony there is ALFREDO and his wife, the MAYOR, \n\tDON VINCENZO the landowner, the schoolteachers. Now the music is loud, heart-\n\trending. 'THE END' appears on screen. The lights go on. And there is a great \n\tdin and uproar as one audience leaves and another arrives. The race for empty \n\tseats. Quarrels. The CARABINIERES help the USHER maintain order and persuade the \n\tpeople who want to see the film again to get up and leave. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tUSHER  \n\t\t\t(Exasperate]) \n\t\tThat's enough now!

He is particularly fast in taking the reel out of the housing. And even \n\tfaster in dropping it into the sack BOCCIA is holding open for him. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tNow get running and bring me the \n\t\tfirst reel.

DAY \n\t\n\tBOCCIA speeds like an arrow on his bicycle through the village streets. Tied to \n\tthe parcel-rack is the sack containing the second part of Catene. He now turns \n\toff the main street and takes a short-cut down a country road. He pedals as fast \n\tas he can. Until he disappears into the distance, beyond the trees.\n\t\n\t45  ENTRANCE OLD ABANDONED MOVIE HOUSE. EXT. DAY \n\t\n\tBOCCIA finally reaches the old movie house, which has been more or less spruced \n\tup. Here too people are lined up in front of the posters of Catene. CICCIO \n\tSPACCAFICO is waiting impatiently on an outside staircase. He too is holding a \n\tsack, containing the first part of the film. The bicycle pulls up in front of \n\thim. The sacks are exchanged. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSPACCAFICO  \n\t\tQuick! Give it to me! Here's the \n\t\tfirst part. Get moving! \n\t\n\tBOCCIA heads back to the Cinema Paradiso, to take the first part to SALVATORE. \n\tSPACCAFICO dashes up the stairs, and hands the sack to a MAN standing in the \n\tdoor, through which the bare projection booth can be seen, and the projector \n\twhich SALVATORE has put back into working order. SPACCAFICO yells in excitement. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSPACCAFICO  \n\t\tHere you are! Quick, quick!! People \n\t\tare waiting!\n\t\n\t46  OLD ABANDONED MOVIE HOUSE. INT. DAY \n\t\n\tIn fact, inside the old freezing cold movie house, the audience is grumbling. \n\tEveryone is wrapped in overcoats and woollen scarves and are sitting on chairs \n\tthey've brought from home and wooden benches. The hum of the projector is heard \n\tat last. The lights go down. The grumbling subsides. The words 'PART TWO' appear \n\ton screen and then the images of the film.\n\t\n\t47  VARIOUS COUNTRY ROADS AND VILLAGE STREETS. EXT.

To carry out another \n\texchange of sacks containing the reels of film.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE.\n\t\n\tAnother race back to Cinema Paradiso. BOCCIA starts looking tired, his breath is \n\tshort.

EVENING\n\t\n\tSALVATORE has got himself a bicycle and is going off to look for\n\tBOCCIA. He pedals fast, turns into the country short cut. Looks\n\taround  not a sign of Boccia. By now it is dark. He sees a MAN in the window of \n\ta farmhouse, calls out to him. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tBoccia! Boccia! \n\t\n\tSALVATORE rides on. Now he's in the open country. All of a sudden he seems to \n\thear something. He stops. Pricks up his ears. It's a sort of moan - he can't \n\tfigure out if it's an animal or a man. He turns on the flashlight he has brought \n\talong. Takes a closer look around. \n\t\n\tCatches sight of a bicycle wheel on the ground behind a bush. That's where the \n\tmoan is coming from! He creeps over in alarm. Next to the bicycle he now catches \n\tsight of the sack with the film. And the moaning gets louder. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(Alarmed) \n\t\tBoccia, what's wrong? \n\t\t\t(He runs over to help his \n\t\t\tfriend. Behind the bush he \n\t\t\tdiscovers BOCCIA humped up \n\t\t\tbetween the legs of \n\t\t\tTERESA, a prostitute. He \n\t\t\tmoves with all the fury \n\t\t\tof his young years. \n\t\t\tSALVATORE has never seen \n\t\t\tpeople making love before \n\t\t\tand is speechless.)\n\t\tDamn you, what are you doing? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tBOCCIA  \n\t\t\t(Shouting) \n\t\tOh, Christ, it's so good!!! \n\t\t\t(And he goes on ramming it \n\t\t\thome.) \n\t\n\t\t\t\tTERESA  \n\t\tHey, cut it out! Go away. Shoo! \n\t\n\tWith a confused look on his face, SALVATORE picks up the sack and walks away, \n\tlooking over his shoulder at the couple who go on tossing around more and more \n\tfrantically.\n\t\n\tBOCCIA lets out a shriek of pleasure that rings through the countryside, as \n\tSALVATORE pedals off like a madman and disappears into the trees. \n\t\n\t52  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY/EVENING \n\t\n\tMusic and the naked body of Brigitte Bardot. A row of youngsters on the main \n\tfloor stare at the naked actress, all excited. A regular rhythmic tremor runs \n\tthrough them, half-hidden by the back of the seats.\n\t\n\tA scene from a horror film. The frightened faces of the audience. Off in one \n\tcorner, the door of the men's toilet opens and a MAN with a contented look comes \n\tout, followed by TERESA, who motions another one to come in. In the projection \n\tbooth, SALVATORE is eating the meal his mother has brought him.\n\t\n\tA gangster film. The tense faces of the audience. A gun battle. Rounds of \n\tmachine-gunfire in the night. The shots echo through the theatre. A LITTLE BOY \n\tclaps his hands over his ears. Alternating with the machine-gunfire on screen, a \n\treal pistol shoots the back of one of the spectators, the landowner DON \n\tVINCENZO, who slumps down in his seat without anybody noticing...The shooting \n\tcontinues up on screen...\n\t\n\tSALVATORE'S hand holds a lighted match under a piece of film, before the \n\thorrified eyes of SPACCAFICO and the USHER, and the puzzled expression of \n\tALFREDO. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tWhat'd I tell you? It doesn't catch \n\t\tfire! \n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tProgress! It always arrives too late!\n\t\n\tA scene from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. The only empty seat\n\tin the theatre is the one where DON VINCENZO was killed. A flower\n\thas been tied to it with string. All the other seats are taken.\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFade to:\n\t\n\tROSA and ANGELO are sitting next to each other. They are watching a\n\tdifferent film. But she has a baby in her arms  they have got married,\n\thave set up a family.\n\t\n\tIn the balcony, the MAN with the face of a public notary spits down\n\tbelow with a contented look. But this time the main floor takes its\n\trevenge and a blob of shit hits him square in the face.\n\t\n\t53  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. MORNING \n\t\n\tIn the morning the theatre is empty. All the doors are shut. Light filters in \n\tthrough the open windows up above, illuminates the posters of coming attractions \n\tand the yellowish screen. Off-screen, a woman's voice \n\tand a boy's voice are heard. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tTERESA'S VOICE  \n\t\t\t(Off-screen) \n\t\tCome on...That's right...relax...\n\t\t\t(Laughing)\n\t\t...Don't be scared...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE'S VOICE  \n\t\t\t(Off-screen) \n\t\tIs it true that if I bleed I've got \n\t\tto squeeze lemon juice on it? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tTERESA'S VOICE  (Off-screen) \n\t\t\t(A loud laugh) \n\t\tLemon juice?...That's a new one for \n\t\tyou! Who tells you this crap...Take \n\t\tit easy...That's right...You see, \n\t\tit's not painful, is it?\n\t\n\tSlow pan along the walls of the theatre, the empty aisles,\n\tdiscovers SALVATORE on the floor between the seats with\n\tTERESA, the prostitute who has already been seen. SALVATORE is\n\tmaking love for the first time in his life. He is awkward and\n\tclumsy. There is an uncertain look in his eyes, his livid face is\n\tdripping with sweat.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tTERESA \n\t\t...There you are! That's right, \n\t\tthat's right! Keep going...\n\t\t\t(SALVATORE is quicker, has \n\t\t\tlearned the lesson. TERESA \n\t\t\tgoads him on.)\n\t\tAh!!! There, now you're a real man! A \n\t\tman! ? A real calf!\n\t\t\t(SALVATORE's panting \n\t\t\tslackens into a deep sigh \n\t\t\tof pleasure.)\n\t\n\t54  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY \n\t\n\tThe blade of a knife, clutched in a hardened hand. A blow. A cry of pain. A calf \n\tfalls like a dead weight to the ground...SALVATORE photographs the animal in \n\tthe throes of death with his 8mm movie camera. As well as the faces of the MEN \n\twho now bleed and skin it quickly. In the vast slaughter-house, the voices of \n\tthe men and animals mingle together.\n\t\n\tSALVATORE'S eye is quick to catch the most unexpected expressions of ordinary \n\tpeople. His movie camera is always ready, like a hunter's rifle. Now he is \n\tshooting...\n\t\n\tA meeting in the square: the passionate reactions of the peasants listening to a \n\tspeaker who flails his arms around.\n\t\n\tAt school: the old SCHOOLMISTRESS sitting at her desk, sunk in God knows what \n\tdreams, her eyes staring off into empty space, as a tear runs down her pale, \n\tunhappy face, and the unknowing STUDENTS carry out their assignments.\n\t\n\tAt the railroad station: the nervous excitement of the people waiting on the \n\tplatforms. SALVATORE pans his camera on to TWO MEN fighting. But an arriving \n\ttrain comes in between. Salvatore follows the train, pans along the cars. The \n\ttrain stops. \n\t\n\t-A door opens and the passengers climb out. Several TRADERS, a CARABINTERE, a \n\tgroup of commuting STUDENTS, the TICKET-COLLECTOR, a distinguished looking \n\tCOUPLE and lastly, a GIRL who stops in the middle of the viewfinder. SALVATORE \n\tis immediately attracted by her face. He goes on shooting without leaving it a \n\tmoment. He follows her through the lens. She is very beautiful, must be around \n\tsixteen, a simple, sweet face, blue eyes. She is certainly the daughter of the \n\tdistinguished looking COUPLE who got off just before she did. The little family \n\tmoves off down the platform. Salvatore follows the girl's movements, as if \n\thypnotized. Now she passes by him, turns towards him for one moment, as if \n\ttrying to figure out where he is aiming that funny-looking gadget. SALVATORE \n\tsmiles at her, entranced.\n\t\n\t55  HIGH SCHOOL. COURTYARD. ENTRANCE. EXT. MORNING\n\t\n\tThe JANITOR is ringing the bell. In the courtyard, on the other side of\n\tthe gate, the STUDENTS prepare to enter. SALVATORE is with a group\n\tof schoolmates, including BOCCIA. And they all stare, wide-eyed, at\n\tthe GIRL from the station. She has her books under her arm and is\n\twalking by herself.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tYou know that one there?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBOCCIA  \n\t\tShe's new. Not bad though. Nice-\n\t\tlooking.\n\t\t\t(SALVATORE has the look of \n\t\t\tsomebody seeking for an \n\t\t\tidea, some way of picking \n\t\t\tup a conversation with \n\t\t\ther.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSECOND STUDENT  \n\t\tHer father s the new bank director. \n\t\tLoaded, luxury and easy living!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tFIRST STUDENT  \n\t\tPeople who jerk off with a shirt so \n\t\tthey won't get their hands dirty. \n\t\t\t(Laughs.)\n\t\n\tAll at once, BOCCIA and SALVATORE notice that the GIRL drops\n\ther lunch without noticing as she is about to enter the school. They\n\tfly off, swift as arrows. It's a chance not to be missed. BOCCIA is\n\tthe quicker, is already in the lead. SALVATORE gives an angry\n\tgesture. A flash come into his eyes, the same flash he had as a little\n\tboy when he finds the right way to hit home. He picks up his step,\n\ttrips BOCCIA and brings him to the ground. He pounces on him\n\tand lets go with his fist. He starts running again. Picks the\n\tbundle off the ground. Catches up with the GIRL from the\n\tstation, nervous and inexperienced, but polite.\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tLook, you dropped this.\n\t\n\tAnd he hands her her lunch with a smile. She recognizes him.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tOh, thanks. I hadn't noticed...\n\t\n\tShe takes the bundle as SALVATORE touches her hand delicately.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tMy name's Salvatore...And yours?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\t\t(Smiling) \n\t\tElena. My name's Elena.\n\t\n\tSALVATORE is very flustered. He feels as if all his blood were\n\tthrobbing in his head. He tries to say something else, but the words\n\tcatch in his throat.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tI...I...The other time at the \n\t\tstation.\n\t\n\tBOCCIA suddenly grabs him by the collar and yanks him away. ELENA is frightened, \n\tputs her hand over her eyes so as not to see.\n\t\n\t56:CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON \n\t\n\tSALVATORE has a black eye, swollen shut. He is setting up a little 8mm projector \n\ton a stool. ALFREDO is sitting in one corner. He has come to keep him company. \n\tHe listens to the sound-track of the movie being shown. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO\n\t\tChaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tThat's right, Modern Times. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tI've shown it so many times I know it \n\t\tby heart. The first time I showed \n\t\tit, in 1940, was the Sunday my first \n\t\twife died. They kept it hidden from \n\t\tme all day so they wouldn't have to \n\t\tclose down the movie house. I only \n\t\tfound out that night, after the last \n\t\tshow. Those are things you never \n\t\tforget...\n\t\t\t(Changing his tone.) \n\t\tSo, Toto, how are these home movies \n\t\tgoing? \n\t\t\t(SALVATORE has switched on \n\t\t\tthe little projector and a \n\t\t\tsquare of light appears on \n\t\t\tthe wall beside ALFREDO, \n\t\t\twith the scenes shot in \n\t\t\ttown.) \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tYes. \n\t\t\t(The shots of the \n\t\t\tslaughter-house have \n\t\t\tappeared.) \n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(Whispering) \n\t\tWhat is it, what is it? What's the \n\t\tpicture? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tIt's people in the slaughter-house \n\t\tkilling a calf. There's blood all \n\t\tover the floor, like a lake. And \n\t\tthrough this lake another calf passes \n\t\tby on its way to die. \n\t\n\tALFREDO is concentrated, as if SALVATORE'S description transmitted the \n\treal image to him, the colours, the forms. The railway station has appeared on \n\tthe wall, and the sequence of ELENA. SALVATORE does not move, does not say a \n\tword, as he gazes at those blue eyes looking into the camera. ALFREDO senses \n\tsomething funny in the boy's s11ence.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tNow what can you see?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tNothing, there's nothing. It's all \n\t\tout of focus.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(Smiling) \n\t\tIs there a woman?...Tell me the \n\t\ttruth...\n\t\t\t(SALVATORE is shamed, \n\t\t\tuncertain, doesn't know \n\t\t\twhet to say. A tender look \n\t\t\tfilters through ALFREDO's \n\t\t\tdark glasses. He has \n\t\t\tobviously caught on and \n\t\t\twhispers:) \n\t\tThere is a woman.\n\t\n\tSALVATORE is forced to admit it, with a sigh.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tYes, it's a girl I saw at the \n\t\tstation.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tWhat's she like? What's she like?...\n\t\n\tAnd as other shots of ELENA appear on the screen, SALVATORE describes her. As \n\tonly somebody in love could.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tShe's nice. My age...Slender, with \n\t\tlong hair, brunette. She had big blue \n\t\teyes, a simple expression and a \n\t\tlittle beauty mark on her lip, but \n\t\treally tiny. You can only see it \n\t\tclose-up. And when she smiles...She \n\t\tmakes you feel...\n\t\n\tHe stops. Only now does he realize that he has let himself be carried away by \n\tpassion, by the desire to talk about her. ALFREDO smiles, spellbound...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tEh! Love...what a mystery!\n\t\t\t(SALVATORE turns off the \n\t\t\tprojector and heaves a \n\t\t\tdeep sigh, almost of \n\t\t\tliberation. ALFREDO'S \n\t\t\tsympathy does him a lot of \n\t\t\tgood. It's nice to be \n\t\t\tunderstood. He moves over \n\t\t\tcloser to him. ALFREDO \n\t\t\truns his hand through his \n\t\t\thair, whispers:)\n\t\tI understand you, Toto...The ones \n\t\twith blue eyes are the\n\t\tmost beautiful. Whatever you do, you \n\t\tcan't make friends with\n\t\tthem.\n\t\t\t(SALVATORE is comforted by \n\t\t\tthe way he talks. He \n\t\t\tdidn't think it\n\t\t\twas possible to put into \n\t\t\twords the things he has \n\t\t\tfelt since meeting\n\t\t\tELENA. He nods his head. \n\t\t\tALFREDO sighs.)\n\t\tEh, there's nothing to be done about \n\t\tit! The heavier a man is,\n\t\tthe deeper his footprints. And if \n\t\the's in love, he suffers,\n\t\tbecause he knows he's up a one-way \n\t\tstreet. Because love is a\n\t\tmeaningless thing when a man gets it \n\t\tinto his head to do what\n\t\the wants...\n\t\t\t(SALVATORE is touched by \n\t\t\this sensitivity, by his \n\t\t\tintense, passionate, sweet \n\t\t\tway of speaking.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tWhat you say is wonderful! But sad...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(Smiling) \n\t\tThey're not my words. John Wayne said \n\t\tit in Shepherd of the Hills.\n\t\n\tSALVATORE suddenly changes expression, as if discovering he was being made fun \n\tof.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tStinking two-timer!! \n\t\t\t(And they burst out \n\t\t\tlaughing.)\n\t\n\t57:CINEMAPARADISOANDVARIOUSSTREETS.EXT.DAY\n\t\n\tA grey, windy day.

SALVATORE is about to enter through the\n\tsmall door of the spiral staircase, when in the distance he catches sight\n\tof...\n\t\n\tELENA crossing a street with her books under her arm. She is alone.\n\tSALVATORE doesn't stop to think twice, dashes off, runs through streets\n\tfull of dust, another square, turns the corner, but has lost sight of her.\n\tHe looks around in all directions  there she is! He starts running again.\n\tAnd finally catches up with her, all out of breath, practically\n\tspeechless with emotion.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tHi, Elena!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tHi.

He talks to \n\t\t\thimself.)\n\t\t...What an idiot! What an idiot! \n\t\t'Nice day'! Christ!!\n\t\n\t58:SALVATORE'S BEDROOM.INT.DAY \n\t\n\tSALVATORE projects images of ELENA on his wall. He lies across his bed gazing at \n\ther image.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tYou probably don't believe me, but \n\t\tI'm going to become the leading man \n\t\tin your life. Sure, I don't look like \n\t\tMarlon Brando, but look at me, really \n\t\tlook at me. Am I really so ugly? So \n\t\tshould I try once more? Maybe It'll \n\t\tsucceed. What do you \n\t\tsay? \n\t\n\tELENA seems to be saying, Yes. As SALVATORE kisses ELENA, her image disappears. \n\tHe is left with his face against the wall in the white light from the \n\tprojector.\n\t\n\t59:PHONEB00TH AND ELENA'S HOUSE.INT.DAY\n\t\n\tSALVATORE is in a phone booth. The telephone will certainly help him feel less \n\tnervous.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tHello, can I speak to Elena, please?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tWOMANS VOICE  \n\t\tYes. \n\t\t\t(SALVATORE recognizes \n\t\t\tELENA's voice, changes his \n\t\t\ttone, turns sweeter, more \n\t\t\tpersonal.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE \n\t\tIs that you, Elena?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN'S VOICE  \n\t\tYes...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tOh, I'm sorry, I didn't recognize \n\t\tyour voice. This is Salvatore, \n\t\tremember?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN'SVOICE  \n\t\tYes...\n\t\n\tSALVATORE finally speaks, says everything all in one breath, without stopping, \n\twithout hesitating, in order to leave no room for shyness.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tListen, I know that every time we see \n\t\teach other I make a fool of myself, \n\t\tbut I'm not like that, I swear. It's \n\t\tjust that when I see you, I feel shy, \n\t\tthe right words don't come to me, I \n\t\tdon't have the courage to say that \n\t\tall I do is think about you...\n\t\t\t(He has finally got it \n\t\t\tout. He's dripping with \n\t\t\tsweat, but happy at having \n\t\t\tsucceeded. He continues.) \n\t\tThat's right, Elena, you're the last \n\t\tthing I think of when I go to sleep \n\t\tand the first when I wake up in the \n\t\tmorning. And at night I always dream \n\t\tof you. I know, it's not good on the \n\t\tphone. But please, don't get me \n\t\twrong. Because I love you very \n\t\tmuch...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN'SVOICE  \n\t\t\t(Interrupting him) \n\t\tIf you don't stop phoning her, I'm \n\t\tcalling the police!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(Stunned) \n\t\tBut excuse me, who's speaking?\n\t\n\tAt ELENA'S house, a WOMAN who is visibly in a state is speaking on the phone.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA'S MOTHER  \n\t\tI'm Elena's mother, you filthy pig! \n\t\n\tSALVATORE feels like dropping through the floor, tries to get a word in to \n\texplain, to apologize, but the flood of insults overwhelms him.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tI'm sorry, Signora, maybe there's a \n\t\tmisunderstanding...I...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN'S VOICE  \n\t\tAnd don't call my daughter any more. \n\t\tNever! \n\t\n\tSALVATORE has no choice but to hang up, disappointed, defeated. He's so mad he \n\tstarts slapping himself.\n\t\n\t60:ALFREDO'S HOUSE.EXT.AFTERNOON\n\t\n\tGood Friday. ALFREDO comes out of his house, leaning on\n\tSALVATORE's shoulder. They go off down the street, towards the\n\tchurch. SALVATORE has finished recounting his misadventure.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tI told you, the blue-eyed ones are \n\t\tthe most difficult.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tBut why? There must be some way to \n\t\tmake her understand!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tDon't think about it, Toto. Don't \n\t\teven try. With feelings, there's \n\t\tnothing to understand. \n\t\n\tSALVATORE gives an angry gesture. This time ALFREDO'S words do not quiet his \n\tfrenzy, don't help him. He moves away from him a few steps.\n\t\n\tALFREDO stands there motionless in the middle of the road.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tStop it! I've had enough of your \n\t\tsermons! You act as if you created \n\t\tthe world! \n\t\t\t(A bicycle streaks by \n\t\t\tALFREDO, who gives a \n\t\t\tstartled jump, as if it \n\t\t\twere about to \n\t\t\trun into him. He raises \n\t\t\this voice, panic-\n\t\t\tstricken.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tHeeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off \n\t\twith me now! Come here! I don't \n\t\tknow where the fuck I have to go. \n\t\t\t(A MAN on a bicycle almost \n\t\t\tcollides with ALFREDO. \n\t\t\tSALVATORE fumes, goes over \n\t\t\tto him listlessly. ALFREDO \n\t\t\tputs his hand back on his \n\t\t\tshoulder and they start \n\t\t\twalking again. ALFREDO has \n\t\t\tcalmed down, but his voice \n\t\t\tis determined.) \n\t\tAnd the next time be careful how you \n\t\ttalk. Not to take credit away \n\t\tfrom the Lord, but if I had created \n\t\tthe world, in all modesty, certain \n\t\tthings would have come out better. \n\t\tBut unfortunately such was not the \n\t\tcase.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE \n\t\t\t(Laughing) \n\t\tYou see, it s like I say. You always \n\t\thave an answer for everything.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tI want to make you happy, Toto! I'm \n\t\tgoing to tell you a story. \n\t\t\t(And he squeezes \n\t\t\tSALVATORE'S shoulder. It's \n\t\t\tthe signal for taking a \n\t\t\trest. They sit in a \n\t\t\tdoorway. ALFREDO starts \n\t\t\ttelling his story, and his \n\t\t\tway of speaking is \n\t\t\thypnotic, magical. With \n\t\t\tthose eyes lost in empty \n\t\t\tspace, it's as if his \n\t\t\tthoughts and his words \n\t\t\tcame in from some other \n\t\t\tdimension, mysterious, \n\t\t\thidden...) \n\t\tOnce upon a time a king gave a feast \n\t\tand there were all the most beautiful \n\t\tprincesses of the realm. Basta, one \n\t\tof the guards, saw the king's \n\t\tdaughter: she was the loveliest of \n\t\tall! And he immediately fell in love \n\t\twith her. But what could a poor \n\t\tsoldier do compared with a king's \n\t\tdaughter?!...One day he managed \n\t\tto meet her and told her he couldn't \n\t\tlive without her. The princess was so \n\t\tstruck by the depth of his feeling \n\t\tthat she said to the soldier  'If you \n\t\twill wait a hundred days and a \n\t\thundred nights beneath my balcony, \n\t\tthen in the end I'll be yours.' \n\t\tChrist, the soldier ran off there and \n\t\twaited! One day, two days, \n\t\tten, twenty...Every night she looked \n\t\tout of her window, but he never \n\t\tbudged. Come rain, wind, snow, never \n\t\tbudged! The birds shat on him and the \n\t\tbees ate him alive! After ninety \n\t\tnights he was gaunt and pale and \n\t\ttears streamed from his eyes but he \n\t\tcouldn't hold them back. He didn't \n\t\teven have the strength to sleep any \n\t\tmore. The princess kept watch...And \n\t\ton the ninety-ninth night, the \n\t\tsoldier got up, picked up his chair \n\t\tand left!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tNo! You mean right at the end? \n\t\t\t(SALVATORE is amazed, \n\t\t\tdumbfounded; that ending \n\t\t\thas made a deep \n\t\t\timpression. They \n\t\t\tstart walking again.)\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tThat's right, Toto, right at the end? \n\t\tAnd don't ask me what it means. If \n\t\tyou figure it out, let me know...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tI'll be damned'\n\t\n\t6I:CHURCH.INT.EVENING\n\t\n\tBefore the high altar, the Virgin Mary in tears clutches three spikes inher \n\thand. And beside her is another statue  Christ descended from the\n\tcross. MEN and WOMEN stand in line to kiss Christ's wounds. Many people are \n\tsitting between the pews. SALVATORE helps ALFREDO take a seat, and at that \n\tmoment catches sight at the far end of ELENA on her way to the confessional. \n\t\n\tShe kneels down on one side, just as FATHER ADELFIO comes out of the middle \n\tbooth and goes to the altar to say something to the sacristan. SALVATORE'S eyes \n\tlight up. He has had a brainstorm. \n\t\n\tHe leans over and whispers something into ALFREDO's ear. ALFREDO nods his head. \n\tSALVATORE is so happy that he gives him a pat on the cheek, like a caress. Then \n\the hurries over to the PRIEST. Says something in a low voice, gesticulates with \n\tsome agitation, points to the pew where ALFREDO is sitting. The PRIEST tries to \n\tsay he can't now, but SALVATORE insists, and wins. The PRIEST goes over to \n\tALFREDO, leans over. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n\t\tWhat is it, Alfredo? Right now, of \n\t\tall times! \n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(In a grave voice) \n\t\tFather Adelfio, I have a very serious \n\t\tdoubt that is torturing my soul. And \n\t\tyou've got to help me, because I've \n\t\tlost all peace of mind...\n\t\n\tSALVATORE watches from a distance. He sees the PRIEST put on an alarmed \n\texpression and then sit down beside ALFREDO. Everything's ready. He creeps over \n\tto the confessional. ELENA is there, kneeling down waiting for the PRIEST to \n\tarrive. In an instant, without anyone noticing, SALVATORE pops inside the \n\tconfessional. He shuts the little door below and draws the purple curtain. On \n\tthe other side of grille, only a few inches away, those eyes that keep him awake \n\tall night. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tFather, I have sinned...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(In a low voice) \n\t\tWe'll talk about that later. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\t\t(Surprised) \n\t\tBut...who...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(Interrupting her) \n\t\tSssssh, Be quiet, pretend \n\t\teverything's normal. I'm Salvatore. \n\t\n\tELENA'S eyes pop in amazement.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tWhat are you doing here?\n\t\n\tMeanwhile ALFREDO and the PRIEST continue their unusual and animated discussion. \n\tThe PRIEST is appalled, crosses himself. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n\t\tBut Alfredo, what you're saying is \n\t\thorrifying! \n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tI know. But take the-miracle of the \n\t\tloaves and fishes, for example! I \n\t\tthink about it a lot...How is it \n\t\tpossible for...\n\t\n\tIn the confessional, the whispered conversation between SALVATORE and ELENA \n\tcontinues.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\t\t(Annoyed) \n\t\tThere was a terrible rumpus at home. \n\t\tMy mother told my father. And how \n\t\tcould you have mistaken my voice?!\n\t\n\tSALVATORE is mortified, on tenterhooks, keeps an eye on ALFREDO and the PRIEST \n\tthrough a crack in the curtain.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tForgive me, Elena. It was stupid of \n\t\tme. But I had to talk to you. \n\t\n\tShe looks up at him and her eyes are even more beautiful in the candlelight. \n\tThis time SALVATORE finds the courage to speak to her calmly, with \n\tdetermination. That grille probably helps him, allows him to see without being \n\tseen.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tYou're so beautiful, Elena...That's \n\t\twhat I wanted to tell you. When I \n\t\tmeet you, I can't put two words \n\t\ttogether because...you give me the \n\t\tshivers. I don't know what you do in \n\t\tthese situations, what you're \n\t\tsupposed to say. It's the first time. \n\t\tBut I think I'm in love with you. \n\t\n\tELENA gazes through the grille at the two shining specks of his eyes. She is \n\tbewildered by that flood of passion. At that moment, an OLD WOMAN kneels down on \n\tthe other side of the confessional and her face appears behind the grille.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tOLD WOMAN  \n\t\tFather, I have sinned...\n\t\t\t(SALVATORE turns lo her, \n\t\t\tinstinctively.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tI absolve you in the name of the \n\t\tFather, the Son and the Holy Ghost. \n\t\tGo in peace, my daughter. \n\t\t\t(And he slams the panel \n\t\t\tshut in her face. ELENA is \n\t\t\tbarely able to control her \n\t\t\tlaughter.) \n\t\tWhen you laugh, you're even more \n\t\tbeautiful. \n\t\n\tShe pulls herself together again and puts on a serious, but tender look.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tSalvatore, it's awfully sweet of you. \n\t\tAnd even though I don't know you, I \n\t\tlike you. But...I'm not in love with \n\t\tyou. \n\t\n\tFor SALVATORE, it's as if a knife had plunged straight into his heart. He sits \n\tthere gazing into her eyes, at the beauty mark on her lip, without moving. Then \n\tthrough the crack sees ALFREDO and the PRIEST conversing nervously, God knows \n\twhat they're saying. And he turns back to her.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tI don't care. I'll wait.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tFor what?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tFor you to fall in love with me too. \n\t\tListen carefully. Every night, when I \n\t\tget off work, I'll come and wait \n\t\tbeneath your window. Every night. \n\t\tWhen you change your mind, open your \n\t\twindow. That's all. I'll \n\t\tunderstand...\n\t\n\tHe smiles at her. She is upset by those exaggerated words, but also intrigued.\n\t\n\tThe PRIEST has meanwhile solved the problem that ALFREDO has made up as an \n\texcuse.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n\t\t\t(Exhausted) \n\t\tYou understand now? You see it \n\t\tclearly?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(Hypocritically) \n\t\tOh yes, father. Now everything's \n\t\tclear.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n\t\tAnd the next time don't go around \n\t\tsaying such heresy. You survived the \n\t\tfire at the movie house. But no one \n\t\tcan save you from the fire of Hell!\n\t\n\t62:SQUARE AND ELENA'S HOUSE. EXT. NIGHT\n\t\n\tSweet poignant music accompanies SALVATORE's long waits beneath the window of \n\tELENA'S room... A warm early summer night. The last spectators wander off into \n\tthe streets. The VILLAGE IDIOT makes his rounds of the square.\n\t\n\tSALVATORE is beneath her window. He waits. The shutters are open,\n\tbut not the windows with the curtains. ELENA peers at him through a\n\tdark crack...\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFade to:\n\t\n\tA rainy night. SALVATORE is back there again. Determined,\n\theadstrong. A dog keeps him company, taking shelter under an\n\toverhanging roof. The window is shut...\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFade to:\n\t\n\tSALVATORE'S hand adds another check to an endless row of checks on\n\tthe calendar. A check a day...\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFade to:\n\t\n\tAnother night. Wind. The window is still shut. SALVATORE's eyes are\n\tthe eyes of a lovesick man prepared to face the hardest battles, just to\n\twin, just to conquer his loved one. She peeks at him through the crack,\n\tbut he can't see her...\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFade to:\n\t\n\tThe paces of the calendar are covered with checks. Several months\n\thave gone by. SALVATORE adds a check on the last page, on 30 December. Tomorrow \n\tnight will be...New Year's Eve. The streets are empty. Loud merry voices can be \n\theard coming from the houses. Old discarded objects hail down from balconies. \n\tFirecrackers explode here and there. SALVATORE is there in the same old place, \n\tas usual. The shutters are open, but not the windows, and all is darkness \n\tinside. SALVATORE is wrapped in a large overcoat and stamps his feet to keep \n\twarm...\n\t\n\t63:SALVATORES HOUSE. GIANCALDO. INT. NIGHT\n\t\n\tToasts are being prepared in SALVATORE's house. MARIA is there\n\twith her daughter, LIA, then ALFREDO with his wife, ANNA.\n\tSALVATORE is the only one missing for the \"family\" to be complete.\n\tThe bottle of spumante and the Christmas cake are ready. The radio is\n\ton with the New Year's Eve programme.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\t\t(Nervously) \n\t\tBut why hasn't Toto shown up? The \n\t\tmovie house is closed at this hour!\n\t\n\tALFREDO has a know-all look. He tries to put her mind at rest.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tHe had to do something for me...\n\t\n\tOver the radio, music and merrymaking\n\t\n\t64:ELENA'S HOUSE.EXT.NIGHT \n\t\n\tMore sounds of merrymaking, coming from ELENA's house. SALVATORE listens to it, \n\tsees the shadows of her parents and relatives, maybe even hers, ready to \n\tcelebrate, welcome in the New Year. But further on, that window remains dark and \n\tshut. SALVATORE gazes at it again. \n\t\n\tThere is a new look in his eyes, like a gleam of hope. Maybe it's the \n\tspecialness of that night, maybe it's the fire crackers, the festive atmosphere, \n\tbut something tells him that's going to be the right night. The night when \n\tshe'll open her window. In fact, a light suddenly goes on in the room. \n\tSALVATORE'S eyes sparkle, have already taken on the hue of victory. \n\t\n\tThe window is pulled open, and his heart starts pounding like a drum. The music \n\treaches its climax. Two hands come out. SALVATORE shuts his eyes for a moment, \n\tto hold back the flood of feeling. He opens them again and sees......The hands \n\treach out and take hold of the shutters and pull them shut. The light goes out. \n\tIt is midnight. An echoing voice does the countdown.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tRADIO VOICE  \n\t\tSix, five, four, three, two, one, \n\t\tzero! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! \n\t\n\tAnd a roar of voices, shouts, explosions, fills the air. SALVATORE has remained \n\tstanding there immobile, speechless. Disappointed. Defeated.\n\t\n\t65  SALVATORE S HOUSE. GIANCALDO. INT. NIGHT\n\t\n\tAt his house, glasses are about to be raised. There is a strange, tense \n\tmerriment. MARIA is unable to conceal her concern, her presentiment. She glances \n\tat the door, hoping to see SALVATORE appear.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(To Maria) \n\t\tThere's nothing to worry about. He's \n\t\tprobably with his friends. \n\t\t\t(To all) \n\t\tLet's toast!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tEVERYBODY  \n\t\t\t(Toasting) \n\t\tHere's to you! Here's to you!

NIGHT \n\t\n\tBut SALVATORE is not happy in these first few minutes of the New Year. He feels \n\thurt, humiliated, rejected. He walks off amidst the old discarded objects flying \n\tdown from the terraces. That was his last night. He's not showing up beneath \n\tthat balcony any more.\n\t\n\t67  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. AFTERNOON \n\t\n\tOutside there is a violent thunderstorm. The pounding of the rain and the \n\trumbling of the thunder drown out the sound-track of the film being shown. Two \n\tbuckets are on the floor to catch the water dripping through the roof. SALVATORE \n\tis alone. For the first time he feels he hates the profession he's got into. He \n\tis tearing up the calendar where he checked off the nights he spent waiting for \n\tELENA. He tears it into a thousand pieces, as if trying to wipe out the traces \n\tof his grief. He is so absorbed in his thoughts that he doesn't notice that \n\tsomeone has appeared at the top of the stairs and quietly entered the room. And \n\tnow stands there watching him in silence. The thunder is deafening. That someone \n\tis ELENA. She comes up behind him, realizes he is thinking \n\tabout her. Whispers. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tSalvatore...\n\t\n\tLoud passionate music is heard on the monitor. SALVATORE turns and sees her as \n\tif in a dream. It is a sudden blow to the heart. The look on her face is \n\twonderfully sweet, the look of somebody who knows she is madly loved and \n\twho now realizes at last that she is in love too. For SALVATORE it is an \n\toverwhelming, almost unbearable moment...A long passionate embrace that is \n\tnever-ending. They are happy, cling to each other never to leave each other \n\tagain. \n\t\n\tThey spin around, end up against the wall where strips of film are hanging, the \n\tfirst-part endings and the trailers. Another intense look, their eyes \n\tlocked...And it is their first kiss. A kiss at first timid, hesitant, almost \n\tclumsy, and then becomes resolute, poignant. Amidst the film strips dangling \n\taround and touching their young faces. Meanwhile the film has finished, the \n\tprojector turns uselessly...Down below the screen is blank, the audience \n\twhistles...But SALVATORE hears nothing, neither the whistles nor the useless \n\twhirring of the reels in the projector. All he hears is her breathing, an he \n\tfeels is the warmth of her \n\tskin.\n\t\n\t68  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY\n\t\n\tThe happiest, most vivid moments SALVATORE and ELENA spend\n\ttogether:\n\t\n\tA country outing. They eat a lavish salad using the flat branches of the\n\tprickly pear for plates.\n\t\n\tA chase through an endless field of wheat.\n\tIn the projection booth. A cake with seventeen lighted candles.\n\tSALVATORE and ELENA blow them out together. And then a kiss.\n\t\n\t69  ROAD AT THE EDGE OF TOWN.EXT. DAY\n\t\n\tSALVATORE is driving an old beaten-up Balilla he bought from a\n\tcar-wrecker. ELENA sits beside him, having the time of her life. They\n\troar with laughter. The car jolts, moves by fits and starts, jarred by the\n\tholes in the road, and besides SALVATORE is not such a hot driver. She\n\tfondles him.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\t\t(Ironically) \n\t\tYou have a great future as a driver. \n\t\tIf they don't arrest you first!!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tThat's nothing to do with it, it's \n\t\tthe car that's still being run in...\n\t\n\tHe has barely finished the last sentence when the car gives a\n\tsudden violent shudder. A sharp report. A cloud of white smoke issues from the \n\tmotor. And the Balilla stops dead in its tracks. ELENA and SALVATORE cannot \n\tsmother their wild laughter. They embrace. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tSO now how do we get home? \n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCut to:  \n\t\n\tThe two of them are standing beside the empty road, looking bored, as they have \n\talready been waiting a long time for someone to go by, a car, a wagon. When all \n\tat once a car comes around the bend, heading for town. SALVATORE and ELENA flag \n\tit down. \n\t\n\tThe DRIVER slows down. The back door opens, a MAN gets out. An alarmed and \n\tstartled look comes over ELENA's face  that man is her FATHER. She sees him \n\tstride over in a rage. \n\t\n\tHe has almost reached SALVATORE, who tries lo be polite, to make the best of the \n\tsituation. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tHello, Dr Mendola...Hem...\n\t\n\tELENA buries her face in her hands, so as not to see...\n\t\n\t70  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING\n\t\n\tSALVATORE has a bruise on his cheek and two Band-aids on his face.\n\tHe got himself a good thrashing, and then some. The house is jammed,\n\tas on the great occasions. Curiosity is written all over the faces of the\n\taudience. But what they're seeing is not a film, but an instalment of\n\tDouble or Nothing. SALVATORE is standing by a teleprojector which\n\thas been set up in the central aisle of the balcony. It is a machine that\n\tmakes it possible to project television show on the screen. ALFREDO is\n\tsitting beside him.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(In a low voice) \n\t\tToto, are you pulling my leg or \n\t\tsomething? How is it possible to see \n\t\tthis television without film?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tJust so, Alfredo. There isn't any. \n\t\tAnd if you buy a television set, you \n\t\tcan watch it at home, without any \n\t\tfuss...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(Sceptically) \n\t\tCould be...But I don't like this\n\t\tbusiness. It smells fishy to me.\n\t\n\tELENA is sitting in one corner of the balcony with her parents. Sitting beside \n\ther FATHER is the owner of the movie house, SPACCAFICO, who thanks him.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSPACCAFICO  \n\t\t\t(In a low voice) \n\t\tYou see what a bright idea, Dr \n\t\tMendola? But without the bank loan \n\t\thow could I have bought the machine? \n\t\tIf we don't get organized around \n\t\there, in this day and age, we'll meet \n\t\tthe same end as the Punch and Judy \n\t\tshows! \n\t\n\tELENA is not very interested in the TV show. She sneaks a look at SALVATORE. \n\tFrom the looks on their faces, it is clear that things are not going very well. \n\tHe gives her a nod, as if to say he wants to speak to her and that she should \n\tfigure out some way! ELENA leans over to her MOTHER, whispers something into her \n\tear.\n\t\n\t7I  CINEMA PARADISO. TOILET. INT. EVENING\n\t\n\tELENA's MOTHER stands waiting in front of the women's toilet,\n\tgazing at Mike Bongiorno emceeing the TV show in the distance.\n\t\n\tInside the toilet, ELENA is standing on the toilet seat whispering to\n\tSALVATORE, who is standing on the 20ilet seat of the men's toilet.\n\t\n\tTheir eyes are barely able to peek over the flush tank which they have\n\tuncovered. ELENA is worried.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tCould it be your father doesn't like \n\t\tthe work I do...That my family's too \n\t\tpoor...Is that it? \n\t\n\tShe gives a nod of the head, but only faintly, so as no2 to wound his \n\tvulnerability. SALVATORE sighs.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA'S MOTHER  \n\t\t\t(Off-screen) \n\t\tElena!\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tAll right! ! \n\t\t\t(To Salvatore, in a \n\t\t\twhisper) \n\t\tFor the moment it's impossible to see \n\t\teach other...As soon as school is \n\t\tout, we're going to go stay with \n\t\tfriends in Tuscany. We'll be there \n\t\tall summer...Maybe if you came up, \n\t\twe could meet in secret...\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(Crestfallen) \n\t\tBut we're opening the outdoor movie \n\t\ttheatre this summer. What will I do \n\t\tall this time without seeing you?!\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tI'll write to you every day. Don't \n\t\tworry. I love you. The summer'll be \n\t\tover and I'll be back...\n\t\n\tThey reach out to kiss each other. Who knows when they'll be able to see each \n\tother again?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA'S MOTHER  \n\t\t\t(Off-screen) \n\t\tElena! \n\t\n\tELENA climbs down, pulls the chain and walks off, leaving SALVATORE standing \n\tthere on the toilet seat.\n\t\n\tSummer has come. A bevy of barefoot children chase after the carts carrying the \n\tcarters' families to the beach to go swimming. SALVATORE, helped by the USHER, \n\thas finished loading the disassembled projector on to a wagon in order to carry \n\tit to the outdoor movie house. The USHER has hung a sign on the Cinema Paradiso \n\tto the effect that 'Showings to continue at the Imperia Arena', and now climbs \n\tinto the wagon. \n\t\n\tThe horse moves off slowly and the monotonous clatter of its hoofs reminds \n\tSALVATORE that the summer is going to be long this year, longer than ever. And \n\the leans on the projector that totters and lurches from the jolting of the \n\twheels. A cart carrying a cheerful and noisy family pulls up alongside the \n\twagon. There are the MEN from the slaughter-house. They recognize SALVATORE. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSLAUGHTER-HOUSE MAN \n\t\tWell, look who's here!! Cecil B. De \n\t\tMille! Hey, Toto!! When are you \n\t\tcoming to shoot another film?!? \n\t\n\tAnd they laugh, with their gaping toothless mouths. SALVATORE doesn't feel like \n\tjoking, not even like answering. He looks away, so as not to see their leers. He \n\twants to be by himself. \n\t\n\t73  BEACH AND IMPERIA ARENA. EXT. DAY \n\t\n\t\n\tThe beach is almost deserted, dotted here and there with groups of bathers. The \n\tcarts and horses are scattered in the sand, near the Imperia Arena, where some \n\tWORKMEN are putting on the finishing touches for the new opening. The wagon \n\tarrives and SALVATORE and the USHER unload the projector.\n\t\n\t74  BEACH. IMPERIA ARENA. PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT.EVENING\n\t\n\tA sultry evening. The jacklights of the octopus fishers twinkle on the\n\tdark horizon. The sound-track of a comic film reverberates over the sea,\n\tthe laughter of the audience mingles with the sound of the shallow waves\n\tbreaking on the rocks. A group of LITTLE BOYS in a boat pulls away\n\tfrom shore. They join some more boats standing still in the water, all of\n\tthem crammed with LITTLE BOYS all looking in the same direction...\n\ttowards the screen of the open-air movie at the water's edge. There is a\n\tfunny scene.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tLITTLE BOYS  \n\t\tAll seats are sold out! Free entrance \n\t\tand payment on the way out!! Sssssh!!\n\t\n\tAnd they guffaw noisily. Their laughter is echoed by more\n\tlaughter, in the distance...\n\t\n\t...the laughter of the Arena audience, scattered among the\n\tmetal chairs. By dint of laughing, the people in one of the rows\n\tof chairs tip over backwards. Screams, laughs, whistles.\n\tThe projection booth has a door at the back with stairs leading\n\tdown to the rocks. SALVATORE is sitting on the ground, bare\n\tchested, tired and sticky with sweat. He is reading a letter from\n\tELENA. He is so engrossed the words can almost be read on his\n\tface.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA'S VOICE  \n\t\t\t(Off-screen) \n\t\tSalvatore, my darling, here the days \n\t\tnever end. I find your name \n\t\teverywhere if I read a book, do a \n\t\tcrossword puzzle, thumb through a \n\t\tnewspaper...You're always before my \n\t\teyes. Today I've got some rather bad \n\t\tnews. At the end of October we're \n\t\tmoving to the city where I'll attend \n\t\tthe University. It'll be hard to see \n\t\teach other every day. But don't \n\t\tworry, whenever I can get away I'll \n\t\talways come running to you, to the \n\t\tCinema Paradiso.\n\t\n\tOn the Arena screen, with its potted plants and palm trees, a\n\tvery funny scene is being shown. The audience again bursts into\n\twild laughter. And the audience of LITTLE BOYS in the boats also laugh. One\n\tof them, laughing himself to tears, loses his balance and falls\n\tinto the water. The others howl with laughter. A voice rises up\n\tout of the carousel of boats.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tURCHIN  \n\t\tFuck me! I've caught an octopus! An \n\t\toooooctopus!\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE\n\t\n\t75  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY \n\t\n\tThe August sun is blazing hot. People are forced to stay inside when the sirocco \n\tblows. The streets are empty. And there is a strange silence. Nothing can be \n\theard except far in the distance, from somewhere in the country, the love song \n\tof some carter...SALVATORE hears it too, stretched out on the floor of his \n\troom, his eyes fixed on the ceiling where flies buzz around nervously. The \n\tMAILMAN comes down the street on his bicycle, rides up to SALVATORE and hands \n\thim a letter...Sitting in the shade of a white wall, SALVATORE reads the \n\tletter. Next to him, the dog that kept him company at night, beneath ELENA's \n\twindow. He gazes up at him as if looking for news of her.\n\t\n\t76:ARENA IMPERIA. PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT/INT.EVENING\n\t\n\tThe Arena is crowded with sun-burnt faces. On screen, scenes from\n\tUlysses. On a shelf in the projection booth, there is an enormous pack of \n\tletters. SALVATORE is worn out. The waiting has destroyed him. He looks\n\tlike a madman. As he winds up one of the parts of the film, he repeats\n\ther name obsessively, under his breath.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tElena...Elena...Elena...\n\t\n\tNow he is sitting outside on the back steps, a few yards from the\n\tsea. There is a breeze this evening, the waves are rather high and\n\tthe boats of 'gate-crashers' can be seen out in the water, rolling\n\tfitfully but not dangerously. SALVATORE stretches out, gazes up\n\tat the inky sky and talks to himself, just like a madman,\n\twhispering...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tWhen will this shitty summer be over? \n\t\t\t(Half shutting his eyes) \n\t\tIn a film it'd already be finished...\n\t\t\t(Smiling)\n\t\t...Fade-out and cut to a nice \n\t\tthunderstorm!!! Huh? that'd be \n\t\tperfect!\n\t\n\tA clap of thunder explodes in the air. Loud, rumbling. SALVATORE'S eyes pop \n\topen. The Arena audience looks up in alarm at the sky...The 'gate-crashers' in \n\tthe boats also look up and see a streak of lightning ushering in another clap of \n\tthunder. One of those storms is building up that ruins late summer \n\tnights. SALVATORE gives a contented smile as the cloudburst pours down \n\tviolently, suddenly... The Arena audience scatters with a howl and scurries \n\tover to the overhanging roofs of the projection booth, to take shelter and to go\n\ton watching the film despite the rain...\n\t\n\tThe LITTLE BOYS in the boats quickly pull tarpaulins over their\n\theads...But SALVATORE does not get up. He lets the rain fall on him,\n\tgoes on laughing, incredulous and stunned as if a real miracle had\n\ttaken place. And as he shuts his eyes and lifts his head up, to\n\tcatch more rain on his face, and gives himself up to that marvellous feeling of \n\tjoy, a mouth comes to rest passionately on his lips it is ELENA. SALVATORE opens \n\this eyes in utter amazement, it seems like a vision, another hallucination \n\tcreated by the rain...Instead no, it is really her! \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tElena!...But when...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tI got back today. You can't imagine \n\t\tthe excuses I had to make up to be \n\t\there...\n\t\n\tSALVATORE's lips interrupt her. It is an intense, a stupendous kiss. They've \n\tprobably never been so happy as they are at that moment. They cling to each \n\tother as the rain goes on streaming over their bodies, mingling her hair with \n\this, binding them ever closer.\n\t\n\t77  CINEMA PARADISO. ENTRANCE. EXT. DAY\n\t\n\tAutumn has arrived. In the streets, the PEASANTS prepare the barrels\n\tfor preserving the grape must. ALFREDO is sitting in front of the Cinema \n\tParadiso with SPACCAFICO and the USHER. It is a quiet moment, they chat, while \n\tthe humming of the projector and the sound track of the film can be heard \n\tthrough the window of the booth. The MAILMAN stops and hands SPACCAFICO a folded \n\tsheet of paper.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMAILMAN  \n\t\tDon Ciccio, this is for Toto. Give it \n\t\thim...\n\t\t\t(And he pedals off on his \n\t\t\tbicycle.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tWhat is it?\n\t\n\tSPACCAFICO unfolds it, reads it, claps his hands on his head, in alarm.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSPACCAFICO  \n\t\tHoly blood of Judas! Now what am I \n\t\tgoing to do??!\n\t\n\t78  UNIVERSITY. EXT. DAY\n\t\n\tELENA is waiting near the University. She paces nervously back and\n\tforth. Glances at her watch. He's late. She looks around in all\n\tdirections and sees him at last. He comes running up to her. They\n\tembrace...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tSo what'd they say?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tThe army says that, as a war orphan, \n\t\tI don't have to serve in the \n\t\tmilitary, but nothing can be done. \n\t\tIt's a bureaucratic error. I have to \n\t\tleave. Day after tomorrow morning. \n\t\tThey're sending me to Rome. But \n\t\tthey'll discharge me ten days later. \n\t\tLet's go...\n\t\n\tHe takes her hand, turns to go to a café. ELENA holds back. She has caught sight \n\tof her FATHER's car approaching. ELENA turns to look and in a faint voice \n\treveals the reason for her nervousness.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tNo, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's \n\t\tmy father.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tGood, this way we can finally talk. \n\t\tI'll convince him this time.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tHe won't be convinced, Salvatore. He \n\t\thas other plans for me.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tWho?\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tThe son of one of his colleagues. \n\t\tDon't act that way. We'll talk about \n\t\tit later. Wait for me Thursday at the \n\t\tCinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with \n\t\tthe five o'clock bus. \n\t\n\tSALVATORE looks with longing as ELENA drives away with her father. \n\tELENA gives him a meaningful look through the window. SALVATORE returns the \n\tlook, but stands there motionless, with a grim expression, like someone who \n\tknows how to take the treacherous blows of life. The car drives off and with it \n\tELENA. Their eyes hang on the same thread. The thread of hope and now of fear.\n\t\n\t79  CINEMA PARADISO. ENTRANCE. EXT. MORNING\n\t\n\tThe poster of Il Grido hangs on the billboard outside the theatre.\n\tSPACCAFICO replaces 'THURSDAY' with a 'TODAY' sticker. The\n\tCHARWOMAN is washing the floor of the lobby. SPACCAFICO shouts\n\tup to SALVATORE, who is in the projectionist's booth. SPACCAFICIO\n\tsays that tomorrow he'll be leaving and today is his last day on the job,\n\tand he's sorry.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSPACCAFICO  \n\t\tToto, this is no film for the common \n\t\therd. One day'll be more than \n\t\tenough...So tonight, please set up \n\t\ttomorrow's film, so the projectionist \n\t\twho is coming will find it ready.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tOK...\n\t\n\tSPACCAFICO understands SALVATORE's sadness.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSPACCAFICO  \n\t\tCheer up, Toto. I'll be here waiting \n\t\tfor you. No one's taking your job \n\t\taway from you. Don't worry!\n\t\n\t80  SQUARE AND PROJECTION BOOTH, CINEMA PARADISO. EXT/INT. DAY\n\t\n\tThe bus has pulled into the square but among the people getting out\n\tthere is no sign of ELENA. SALVATORE stands nervously up in the window of the \n\tprojection booth, glances at his watch. It's already five-thirty and she hasn't \n\tcome. He checks the projector. The first part has just begun and the reel is \n\tfull of film.\n\t\n\tThe first part is now about to finish, the reel is almost empty, and ELENA still \n\tisn't there. SALVATORE is extremely nervous, worried, mortified by his meeting \n\twith her FATHER. \n\tHe sees ELENA's face pulling away in the car. Thinks back over her \n\tterrible confession. He paces back and forth, as if he were in a prison cell, \n\tthinking up solutions...The stair light finally goes on; there she is SALVATORE \n\tdashes over and down the stairs to meet her. He comes down the final turn of the \n\tspiral staircase and finds himself face to face with ALFREDO, who is slowly \n\tmaking his way up with the help of his cane. SALVATORE freezes to the spot. \n\tALFREDO senses his disappointment. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tYou weren't expecting me? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(Nervously) \n\t\tNo, Alfredo, I was coming to help \n\t\tyou...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(Smiling) \n\t\tYou were expecting her? Huh? \n\t\t\t(SALVATORE doesn't answer. \n\t\t\tHe's too worried, too \n\t\t\tupset. ALFREDO climbs \n\t\t\tanother step, whispering.)\n\t\t...It's a nasty business waiting by \n\t\tyourself. In company it's better. \n\t\tNo?...Then I'll leave. \n\t\n\tAs usual ALFREDO'S sweetness comforts SALVATORE, indeed suddenly gives him a \n\tbold idea, one that quiets his nervousness. He puts a hand on ALFREDO'S \n\tshoulder.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tAlfredo, I need your help!\n\t\n\t8I  ROAD TO THE CITY. EXT. AFTERNOON \n\t\n\tThe Balilla speeds as fast as it can down the road to the city, where ELENA s \n\tfamily has gone to live. SALVATORE drives along in a state of agitation. The \n\tidea of having to leave without seeing ELENA is his obsession. An obsession he \n\trefuses to accept...\n\t\n\t82 CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON\n\t\n\tThe second part has begun, the reel is full. For the first time in many\n\tyears, ALFREDO is alone in the booth, sitting in front of the projector,\n\tand he feels helpless. Not only because he's blind, but also because\n\tthere is nothing he can do for SALVATORE. A strange agitation comes over him, as \n\tif he were experiencing the same anxiety troubling his 'Toto' at that moment. \n\tMeanwhile, the film roll on and with it, time, minutes...\n\t\n\t83  CITY.EXT.AFTERNOON\n\t\n\tSALVATORE has already reached the city. He slows down at the bus\n\tterminus. Looks at the people waiting, but she is not there...\n\tHe asks several girls in front of the University. But they haven't seen\n\ther...\n\t\n\tHe phones from a phone booth. But nobody answers. His self-control\n\tis about to give way to desperation...\n\t\n\t84  CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON\n\t\n\tOn the reel there is less film. Like an hourglass with the sand trickling\n\tthrough...\n\t\n\t85:ELENAS HOUSE IN THE CITY.EXT/INT.AFTERNOON \n\t\n\tSALVATORE comes streaking up in front of her house. He screeches to a stop, \n\tdashes out like greased lightning. His nerves are tense, a slight tremor runs \n\tthrough his whole body. He rings the bell, but nobody answers. A MAN who lives \n\tin the building opens the front door and comes out. \n\t\n\tSALVATORE seizes the chance and climbs up to the third floor. He pounds on the \n\tdoor furiously, almost cracking his knuckles. But all to no avail; there is \n\tnobody at home. He shrieks, panic stricken. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tOpen up! Open up! Elenaaa! \n\t\n\tAnd in fact, there is somebody inside: ELENA's MOTHER. She sits there immobile, \n\twithout a word. \n\t\n\tThe pounding on the door reverberates in the room, but she does not budge, \n\tdetermined to ignore that desperate message.\n\t\n\t86:CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON\n\t\n\tThe reel spins faster.

SUNDOWN\n\t\n\tThe words 'THE END' appear on the screen...and the film runs out, leaving the \n\tprojector turning uselessly. ALFREDO is alarmed. He can hear that the film is \n\tfinished, but doesn't know where to begin. He gropes around. He's scared. Like a \n\tlittle boy calls his mother when he's lost in a crowd, so old ALFREDO calls \n\tSALVATORE. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tTotooooO!

Left \n\t\tmarch! \n\t\n\tSALVATORE sneaks out of line, goes over and slips a letter into \n\tthe mailbox and hurries back to his place.\n\t\n\tOn one of the public phones in a square of Rome, SALVATORE is phoning ELENA. \n\tNobody answers. He slams down the receiver, as the line of SOLDIERS waits its \n\tturn...\n\t\n\tNight-time. A large plastic bag full of water. A thud. SALVATORE wakes up with a \n\tstart in a lake of ice water. He lets out a terrified shriek as the others \n\tlaugh, protected by the dark. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tAaaaaaah! Heeeeeelp!! \n\t\n\tIn the large dormitory, the SERGEANT is handing out the mail. He \n\tthrows a pile of letters on SALVATORE'S bunk. They are his letters to ELENA, \n\tstamped 'ADDRESS UNKNOWN'.\n\t\n\tMess duty. SALVATORE is washing Up, in a sea of water and grease.\n\tHe rimes a pan full of tomato sauce with a tap hose. A spurt of red water \n\tsplatters him in the face. \n\t\n\tA training run. Another letter which SALVATORE drops into the mailbox...\n\t\n\tA cold, rainy night. SALVATORE stands stiff as a poker in front of the \n\tAmmunition depot. It is his first guard duty. Soaked to the skin, gazing wide-\n\teyed into empty space. \n\t\n\tCOLONEL'S office. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(Aggressively) \n\t\tColonel, I was supposed to spend ten \n\t\tdays here and it's been about a year, \n\t\tand I haven't ever gone borne. I'd \n\t\tlike a furlough, at least! \n\t\n\tSALVATORE is in the guardhouse. A cold, dark, filthy cell. His nerves start to \n\tgive way. He bows his head in despair. \n\t\n\tHospital. SALVATORE is exhausted, run-down. The night-stand is jammed with \n\tmedicines. He lies in bed without moving, staring off into empty space, and \n\trepeats obsessively in a low voice, as if talking to himself. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tElena...Elena...Elena...\n\t\t\t(He has touched the \n\t\t\textreme of suffering, a \n\t\t\tyoung man who has \n\t\t\tbeen denied love and \n\t\t\taffection, his rights, \n\t\t\tfreedom. A NURSE comes \n\t\t\tup.) \n\t\n\t\t\t\tNURSE  \n\t\tDi Vita Salvatore, get ready, your \n\t\tdischarge has come through.\n\t\n\tSALVATORE registers this information with his eyes and nods absently.\n\t\n\t92  GIANCALDO. SQUARE AND STREETS. EXT. DAY \n\t\n\tThe bus disappears around the corner leaving SALVATORE standing there alone. It \n\tis a blazing hot day. The sirocco wind blows the yellow dust in all directions. \n\tThe square is empty, the billboard in front of the closed movie house announces \n\ta Western. SALVATORE puts his suitcase on the ground, looks around. Everything \n\texactly the same, immobile. Only one new feature  in the cafe there's a jukebox \n\tplaying 'Estate' sung by Milva. \n\t\n\tSALVATORE turns towards the Cinema Paradiso. The projectionist is at the \n\twindow of the booth, smoking a cigarette. Who knows who he is, where he came \n\tfrom. A hot flurry of dust. SALVATORE turns and sees a dog leaping around kim, \n\twagging its tail. It's the dog that kept him company during his nights beneath \n\tthe window. SALVATORE gives a start of joy, drops his suitcase and leans over to \n\tstroke him. Then he hugs him, as if he were an old friend. \n\t\n\t93  ALFREDO'S HOUSE. INT. AFTERNOON \n\t\n\tSALVATORE goes to see ALFREDO. He is still in bed, has just woken up. He is glad \n\tto hear his 'Toto'. He feels his forehead, his eyes and cheeks, as if to 'see' \n\thim. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tYou 're thinner...You can tell \n\t\tyou've not been treated well. \n\t\t\t(As usual, you can't hide \n\t\t\tanything from ALFREDO. \n\t\t\tSALVATORE senses something \n\t\t\tdifferent in him that he \n\t\t\tcan't figure out, like \n\t\t\tsame wild restlessness \n\t\t\twithin). \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tThey tell me you never go out, never \n\t\ttalk to anybody. Why?\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tToto, sooner or later there comes a \n\t\ttime when talking or keeping quiet is \n\t\tthe same thing. So it's better to \n\t\tshut up. \n\t\t\t(Changing his lone) \n\t\tIt's hot in here. Toto, take me to \n\t\tthe beach. \n\t\n\t94  BEACH AND WATERFRONT. EXT. AFTERNOON \n\t\n\tThe sea is ruffled and the air is less sultry, easier to breathe. \n\tSALVATORE and ALFREDO walk slowly along the waterfront. ALFREDO totters \n\tslightly, holds on to SALVATORE, who is telling him something very funny. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tAt the Christmas party the lieutenant \n\t\tpinches a girl's ass. The girl turns \n\t\taround: it's the daughter of the \n\t\tcommanding officer. The lieutenant is \n\t\tscared to death and says: 'Miss, if \n\t\tyour heart is as hard as what I have \n\t\tjust touched, I'm done for! \n\t\n\tAnd they roar with laughter. They look like two old school buddies telling each \n\tother dirty jokes. They stop beside a low wall. ALFREDO knows that those laughs \n\tare simply a way of uselessly dancing around the countless things that are \n\ttroubling SALVATORE. And he breaks the ice, while SALVATORE is still \n\tlaughing.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\t\t(Seriously) \n\t\tDid you ever see her again? \n\t\t\t(SALVATORE'S laughter dies \n\t\t\taway, taken off-guard as \n\t\t\the is. Then he lights a \n\t\t\tcigarette.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tNo. And nobody knows where she is. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tIt was probably meant to be like \n\t\tthis. Each of us has a star to \n\t\tfollow. So now what are you thinking \n\t\tof doing? \n\t\n\tIt's a terrible question, and SALVATORE has no answer to it. In fact, would \n\trather not even talk about it. He changes his tone, as if he hadn't heard it, \n\tlaughs, trying again to ding to the funny jokes he heard during military \n\tservice.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tListen to this one...The commander \n\t\tsays to the sergeant: 'You \n\t\tremember that windmill that used to \n\t\tbe there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the \n\t\tmill's gone but the wind's still \n\t\tthere!' \n\t\t\t(And he bursts into \n\t\t\tnervous laughter. But this \n\t\t\ttime ALFREDO remains cold, \n\t\t\tunmoved, does not laugh \n\t\t\twith him. SALVATORE \n\t\t\tgradually falls silent. He \n\t\t\tdoesn't know what to say. \n\t\t\tFor the first time in his \n\t\t\tlife, he doesn't know what \n\t\t\tgoal to aim for, doesn't \n\t\t\tknow what to do. The cloud \n\t\t\tof smoke wreaths his \n\t\t\tnervous face, now he seems \n\t\t\tto relax, whispers:) \n\t\tYou remember the story of the soldier \n\t\tand the princess? \n\t\t\t(ALFREDO nods his head.) \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tNow I understand why the soldier went \n\t\taway just before the end. That's \n\t\tright, just one more night and the \n\t\tprincess would have been his. But \n\t\tshe, also, could not have kept her \n\t\tpromise. And...that would have been \n\t\tterrible, he would have died from it. \n\t\tSo instead, for ninety-nine nights at \n\t\tleast he had lived with the illusion \n\t\tthat she was there waiting for him...\n\t\t\t(This time SALVATORE is \n\t\t\tthe one to explain \n\t\t\tsomething to ALFREDO. And \n\t\t\tALFREDO realizes how \n\t\t\tbitter his story is and, \n\t\t\tabove all, that the boy \n\t\t\tstanding there is no \n\t\t\tlonger a boy...) \n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tDo like the soldier, Toto! Go away! \n\t\tThis land is cursed. \n\t\t\t(They are now leaning \n\t\t\tagainst a boat on the \n\t\t\tbeach. ALFREDO goes on \n\t\t\twhispering his words.) \n\t\tWhen you're here every day you feel \n\t\tlike you're at the center\n\t\tof the universe, it seems like \n\t\tnothing ever changes. Then you go \n\t\taway, one year, two...And when you \n\t\tcome back, everything's different. \n\t\tThe thread has broken. You don't \n\t\tfind those you were looking for, your \n\t\tthings no longer exist. Isn't that \n\t\tthe case?...You've got to go away a \n\t\tlong time, for many, many years, \n\t\tbefore coming back and finding your \n\t\tpeople again, the land where \n\t\tyou were born...But not now, it's \n\t\timpossible. Now you're blinder than I \n\t\tam.\n\t\t\t(Intense words, straight \n\t\t\tfrom the heart, and \n\t\t\tSALVATORE is spellbound. \n\t\t\tHe whispers with a smile:) \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tWho said that? Gary Cooper, James \n\t\tStewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? \n\t\t\t(ALFREDO also gives a \n\t\t\tgentle smile) \n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tNo, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! \n\t\tLife's not like you saw it in the \n\t\tmovies. Life...is harder. \n\t\t\t(He lays his hand on \n\t\t\tSALVATORE'S shoulder, \n\t\t\tgives it a hard squeeze.) \n\t\tGet out! Go back to Rome. You 're \n\t\tyoung, the world is yours! And I'm \n\t\told...I don't want to hear you talk \n\t\tany more, I want to hear talk about \n\t\tyou. \n\t\n\tSALVATORE gives a shudder that runs through his very soul. The setting sun lies \n\tcolorless on the horizon.\n\t\n\t95  VARIOUS SETTINGS. EXT/INT. NIGHT \n\t\n\tNight. The square is empty. SALVATORE is sitting on the church steps. \n\tHis head in his hands. He has to make a decision leave or stay. And why?... \n\t'What decision will he make?' is the question that keeps ALFREDO awake, in his \n\thot dark bedroom...\n\t\n\tMARIA, his mother, also can't get to sleep. She knows, senses, that her son is \n\ton the verge of an important turning-point. But what will he decide? What will \n\thappen?...\n\t\n\tAlso LIA, his sister, feels a strange, heavy tension in the air. And \n\tdoesn't sleep. She's probably wondering where SALVATORE is at that \n\thour... \n\t\n\tHe's sitting on the ground. But even if he were to go to bed he wouldn't \n\tsleep. He rubs his face with his hand. The church bell chimes four a.m...\n\t\n\tALMOST THIRTY YEARS LATER, another distant bell is chiming four a.m. And \n\tSALVATORE is once again wide awake. He is thinking, with his hand on his face, \n\tjust like then. And the same decision to make: what to do? Stretched out beside \n\ta sleeping WOMAN, he goes on staring at the window. Outside, the storm has \n\tpassed. The long memory has almost faded, only the sound of a train surfaces in \n\this mind...\n\t\n\t96  GIANCALDO RAILWAY STATION. EXT. DAY\n\t\n\tIt's the train that THIRTY YEARS EARLIER had pulled into the station\n\tof his home town before leaving for Rome. SALVATORE hugs his \n\tMOTHER and SISTER. The moment has come to say goodbye to  \n\tALFREDO. The old man is deeply moved. A heart-rending trembling\n\tcomes into his husky voice. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tDon't come back any more, don't think \n\t\tabout us, don't turn round, don't \n\t\twrite, don't give in to nostalgia. \n\t\tForget us all. If you can't hear it \n\t\tand come back, don't come looking for \n\t\tme, I won't let you into the house, \n\t\tyou understand? \n\t\n\tThey clasp each other tightly, as if they knew they wouldn't be meeting \n\tagain...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tThanks for all you've done for me. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFREDO  \n\t\tWhatever you do, love it like you \n\t\tloved that projection booth of the \n\t\tParadiso when you were little...\n\t\t\t(The train moves now. \n\t\t\tHands wave in the air, \n\t\t\tdrawing further and \n\t\t\tfurther away. The PRIEST \n\t\t\thas arrived at the last \n\t\t\tmoment and waves goodbye \n\t\t\tfrom the distance.)\n\t\n\t\t\t\tPRIEST  \n\t\t\t(Shouting) \n\t\tGoodbye, TotooooooO!!! I got here too \n\t\tlate. What a shame! \n\t\n\tThe figure of ALFREDO and the others can no longer be distinguished. Only a \n\tdistant blur at the end of the track. \n\t\n\t97  PUNTA RAISI AIRPORT. EXT. DAY \n\t\n\tTHIRTY YEARS LATER, a plane flies over Sicily. It lands on the \n\trunway char seems to emerge from the sea and flatten out towards the slopes of \n\tthe dark mountains. Salvatore's face appears among the clouds reflected in one \n\tof the plane windows. He has the tense look of the man who suddenly comes home \n\tafter the adventure of life has carried him afar, wandering the world, where he \n\thas forgotten everything. From the plane window to another window...\n\t\n\t98  SUPERHIGHWAY. INT/EXT. DAY \n\t\n\t...the window of the taxi-cab driving SALVATORE to his home town. The scenery \n\tmoving by on either side of the road summons up sweet memories. A lot of things \n\thave changed, but the colors are still the same. The yellow running through the \n\tentire landscape is unmistakable. And all those black birds perched in a row on \n\tthe guard-rail are crows. \n\t\n\tThe cab now approaches the outskirts of Giancaldo. But if the sign, \n\thadn't been there with the name on it, it could be an entirely different \n\tplace...\n\t\n\t99  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. DAY\n\t\n\tThe house where SALVATORE'S MOTHER lives is also new, nearer the \n\tsea. \n\t\n\tThe old lady is sitting alone in an armchair in the parlor, knitting a white \n\tsweater. Her hands move very swiftly, almost mechanically. \n\t\n\tThe hands of a woman who is waiting. The front doorbell rings twice. MARIA stops \n\tshort. That is what she has been waiting for. She mumbles in excitement. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\tIt's Toto...I knew it...\n\t\n\tAnd she scrambles to her feet, dropping her knitting in the chair, one needle \n\tdangling over the edge. She hurries off, forgetting that she still has the ball \n\tof white yarn in her apron pocket. And the yarn runs off the needles and the \n\tknitting comes undone quickly as she moves about the house, goes down the stairs \n\tto the front door.   \n\t\n\tThere the yam stops and MARIA' s excited voice is heard.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA 'S VOICE  \n\t\t\t(Off-screen) \n\t\tToto!...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE'S VOICE (Off-screen) \n\t\tHow are you, Mamma?... \n\t\n\tThe camera now moves, discovering them through the parlor window, hugging each \n\tother outside the front door. Under the curious eyes of an old bored dog.\n\t\n\t100  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. DAY \n\t\n\tMARIA is no longer wearing an apron. Mother and son are sitting side \n\tby side at the kitchen table...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\tLia'll be so glad to see you, you'll \n\t\tsee. And you won't recognize the \n\t\tkids any more, they're grown up by \n\t\tnow. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(Smiling) \n\t\tThey're always writing to me saying \n\t\tthey want to come to Rome!\n\t\n\tSALVATORE looks around; It's a place he's never seen before, and yet it's \n\this mother's house.)\n\t \n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\tSee how pretty the house is? We did \n\t\teverything over.\n\t\t\t(Smiling) \n\t\tIf it hadn't been for you! \n\t\t\t(Getting up) \n\t\tCome, I have a surprise.... \n\t\t\t(She takes him by the hand \n\t\t\tand leads him out to the \n\t\t\thallway. SALVATORE looks \n\t\t\tat her and feels a pang. \n\t\t\tShe seems smaller, age \n\t\t\twithers the body, she is \n\t\t\tslightly stooped, her hair \n\t\t\tis gathered into a knot at \n\t\t\tthe back other head.)\n\t\tYou must be tired. If you want to \n\t\trest, there's time before the \n\t\tfuneral. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(Interrupting her) \n\t\tNo, Mamma, it only takes an hour by \n\t\tair, you know. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\t\t(Smiling, ironically) \n\t\tYou shouldn't tell me that now. After \n\t\tall these years! \n\t\t\t(SALVATORE gets the \n\t\t\tmessage, feels guilty. \n\t\t\tThinking about it, it \n\t\t\tseems incredible that he \n\t\t\thas never come before. \n\t\t\tMARIA opens a door, steps \n\t\t\taside to let her son in, \n\t\t\twhispers:) \n\t\tI put all your things in here. Go in, \n\t\tgo in...\n\t\n\tSALVATORE lakes a few steps, is flabbergasted at the sight of his old room \n\tperfectly reconstructed and preserved. It looks like a museum, the museum of the \n\tpast. Despite the bed, the clothes in the cupboard, the books on the shelves, it \n\tis perfectly clear that no one has ever lived in it and never will live in it. \n\tMARIA senses his perturbation, remains standing in the doorway as if to leave \n\thim alone...SALVATORE goes over to the bed, looks around  the old 8mm movie \n\tcamera, the projector, his documentaries, the bicycle hanging on the wall, the \n\tphotographs of his favorite movie stars. But what mostly catches his eye is a \n\ttiny framed photograph: SALVATORE as a little boy and ALFREDO, standing smiling \n\tin front of the Cinema Paradiso. Strange, at that time ALFREDO was younger than \n\the is now! It's as if he were standing there before him one last time. That \n\timpressive figure, his good-natured bur firm look, touches his heart. From \n\tALFREDO'S smiling face to...\n\t\n\t101  GIANCALDO. MAIN STREET AND SQUARE. EXT. DAY \n\t\n\t...the coffin where his old blind friend rests for ever. The funeral\n\tprocession winds its way down the main street. At the intersections, , \n\tcars stop to let the black hearse pass by. People cross themselves. The old men \n\tremove their hats. Store shutters are lowered. Then, when the procession has \n\tpassed by, the cars start up again, the old men put their hats back on, the \n\tshutters are pulled up. \n\t\n\tSALVATORE is in the front row with his MOTHER, next to ALFREDO'S WIDOW. \n\tSIGNORA ANNA says in a whisper, her eyes fixed on the coffin.  \n\t\n\t\t\t\tANNA  \n\t\tHe would have been happy you came, \n\t\tToto. He always talked about you. \n\t\tAlways! Right to the end! He was \n\t\tterribly fond of you...\n\t\t\t(Tears come to her, she is \n\t\t\tunable to say any more. \n\t\t\tSALVATORE gives her a hug, \n\t\t\tdeeply touched by her \n\t\t\twords.) \n\t\tHe left two things for you. Come see \n\t\tme before you leave. \n\t\n\tSALVATORE nods his head. He gazes intensely at the coffin covered with flowers \n\tand is grieved as if he were ashamed never to have come to see the man who had \n\tbeen like a father to him. But why had he forgotten him? Up in front, leading \n\tthe procession, he sees a young PRIEST with an altar boy beside him, and these \n\tfigures are also like chisels scraping the rust off his soul and bringing old \n\tfeelings to light again. \n\t\n\tThe procession reaches the square. The dark column stands etched in the dazzling \n\tearly-afternoon light. SIGNORA ANNA motions the driver and the procession comes \n\tto a halt. It is ALFREDO'S last farewell to the place where he had spent the \n\tbest years of his life  the Cinema Paradiso. Everyone turns to look and \n\tSALVATORE also turns, taken by surprise...It has fallen to pieces: doors and \n\twindows boarded shut, crumbling walls, a piece of the sign dangling down, weeds \n\tand mildew in the cracks and on the roof. The square has changed completely, is \n\tunrecognizable. Buildings, stores, sign boards and lines of cars creeping at a \n\tsnail's pace in a deafening chorus of honking horns. And the central square has \n\tturned motorcycles. SALVATORE turns slowly to look behind him, towards the small \n\tcrowd, and is entranced by the unexpected sight of faces that he recognizes at \n\tonce, despite the many years that have gone by:  the MAN AT THE BOX OFFICE, the \n\tUSHER who also served as bill-poster, the CHARWOMAN, the CARABINIERE SERGEANT, \n\tand further on behind ROSA and ANGELO, the lovebirds who had met in the movie \n\thouse and then got married. They all have white hair. And they too have \n\trecognized him, give little hello nods and gestures. Another face \n\the seems to recognize: why sure, it's SPACCAFICO, the owner. How old he's \n\tbecome! He also looks up and his eyes meet SALVATORE'S. A hello nod. \n\tSALVATORE makes his way over to him through the crowd. They shake hands \n\theartily, without a word, both touched. The procession starts up again. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(Under his breath) \n\t\tHow long's it been shut? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSPACCAFICO  \n\t\tSix years ago this May. No one came \n\t\tany more. You \"know better than me, \n\t\tMr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, \n\t\tvideos. By now the movie business is \n\t\tonly a dream. The city's bought it \n\t\tnow to make a new parking lot. Next \n\t\tSaturday they're \n\t\ttearing it down...A pity!...\n\t\n\tSALVATORE is disconcerted, irritated by that 'Mr. Di Vita'. Besides, finding \n\tout that the movie house is to be torn down depresses him, after all, it's a \n\tpiece of his life...And all those curious faces staring at him.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tBut why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? \n\t\tIt didn't used to be that way...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSPACCAFICO  \n\t\tWell, it's hard to call an important \n\t\tperson by his first name. But if it \n\t\treally matters to you, I'11 call \n\t\tyou...\n\t\t\t(Smiling) \n\t\tToto!...\n\t\n\tSALVATORE smiles at that. Meanwhile, the procession has reached the church. \n\tSALVATORE excuses himself and goes over to the hearse. Old SPACCAFICO watches \n\thim go, then says, almost to himself) \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSPACCAFICO  \n\t\tBless you, Toto. \n\t\n\tThe coffin is unloaded. SALVATORE has asked to be one of the \n\tbearers into the church. As he moves off slowly with that weight \n\ton his shoulder, somebody catches his eye on the other side of the sidewalk. An \n\told woman, sixty or seventy years old, with a plastic bag in her hand. She \n\tcrosses herself quickly. SALVATORE recognizes her  she was the one he made love \n\twith for the first time. TERESA, the prostitute. The coffin is carried into the \n\tchurch, followed by the little procession. \n\t\n\t102  SALVATORE' S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. EVENING \n\t\n\tThe little house is sunk in the darkness of evening and the ground floor\n\twindows are lit up. The rustling of the sea can be heard. The family is having \n\tsupper. The table is set with the finest silver and the company china has been \n\tbrought out. LIA is also there with her husband, ALFIO, and their two children. \n\tFILIPPO, fifteen, and SARA, thirteen. The television is on, but the sound has \n\tbeen turned practically all the way down. SALVATORE'S presence arouses a special \n\texcitement. The children look at their uncle with a certain awe, after all they \n\tdon't really know him. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSARA  \n\t\t\t(Playfully) \n\t\tUncle, the next time Granny comes to \n\t\tRome, I want to come along too. I \n\t\twant to see what you do when you \n\t\twork...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(Smiling) \n\t\tFine. But I warn you, there isn't \n\t\tmuch to see. I sell much more smoke \n\t\tthan fire...\n\t\n\tThe CHILDREN laugh. At the sight of them, LIA, ALFIO and MARIA also smile.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tALFIO \n\t\t\t(To SALVATORE) \n\t\tWatch out, don't get too familiar \n\t\twith those two \n\t\t\t(indicating the children)\n\t\tthey're worse than cannibals. They'll \n\t\ttake advantage. \n\t\n\tEverybody laughs again. Even MARIA laughs a lot. SALVATORE looks at her; he had \n\tnever seen her laugh like that, amused, at peace.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tFILIPPO  \n\t\tYou leaving tomorrow, Uncle? \n\t\n\tSALVATORE doesn't know what to say. He feels drunk. It has been a day of violent \n\tupheavals, a series of almost overwhelming emotions and now he knows nothing  on \n\tthe one hand, he' d like to stay, let himself drift on the sweet tide of family \n\tlife, be completely carried off by the rolling waves of his own past: on the \n\tother, he wishes he had never come. He forces himself to smile again.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tI don't know, Filippo. I don't \n\t\tknow...\n\t\n\tThey go on eating, but SALVATORE isn't very hungry. Re peers at LIA eating out \n\tof the comer of his eye, feels deeply bound to her  she has a few white hairs \n\tand light wrinkles line her face. \n\t\n\tThen he looks at her husband, ALFIO, he's going bald but he tries to hide it by \n\tcombing over the little hair left. Who knows what their marriage is like, he \n\twonders. He looks back at LIA, and it's as if she sensed it, she looks up, \n\tguesses the nature of his thoughts, imagines what he is trying to figure out, a \n\tblush colors her cheeks and she smiles. SALVATORE returns a conniving smile.\n\tThe ringing of a phone. SARA starts to get up to go and answer it, hut MARIA \n\tstops her with a glance of the eye.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\t\t(To SALVATORE) \n\t\tIt must be for you...They've been \n\t\tcalling all afternoon. They wanted to \n\t\tknow if you're leaving this evening \n\t\tor tomorrow...\n\t\n\tEveryone turns to SALVATORE with questioning looks, making him feel even more \n\trestless and undecided. The phone goes on ringing.\n\t\n\t103  CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY . \n\t\n\tThe TRAFFIC cops are trying to break the front door down with their\n\tshoulders. Once, twice, and at last, the door flies open with a screech, \n\tkicking up a cloud of dust. SALVATORE enters by himself...\n\t\n\t104  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY \n\t\n\tSALVATORE'S silhouette stands out against the light in the open door. S lowly he \n\tmakes his way into the empty theatre. A thick layer of dust lends everything a \n\tgray, rarefied look. The light streaming in from the windows up above teems with \n\tstrange mates of dust, like a haze. \n\t\n\tCobwebs hang like long veils from the ceiling. SALVATORE walks down the middle \n\taisle. The rows of seats are unhinged, what was once the wooden veneer has \n\twarped from the dampness. He looks around as if he Were thumbing through the \n\talbum of his memories.  \n\t\n\tThe screen dangles from its frame. The emergency exits are boarded \n\tand nailed shut. Observing the emptiness of the theatre, SALVATORE \n\thas the feeling he can hear the howling, the whistling and voices of the . \n\taudience, as he remembers it. But only for one brief moment, then the silence \n\treturns. A mouse creeps along one wall, stops near a pile of dust. SALVATORE is \n\tattracted by that little gray mass. He goes over as the mouse scampers off, \n\ttakes a closer look and recognizes the shape of half a lion's head covered with \n\tdust. He moves it with his foot, then looks up at the projection booth, \n\trepeating the same gesture of bygone years. But the lion's head is no longer \n\tthere, only the outline of it on the wall, and cobwebs have covered the hales of \n\tthe booth, those little square openings that had caused him such long suffering \n\tas a little boy...SALVATORE now climbs up the spiral staircase. Each step kicks \n\tup a little cloud of dust. \n\t\n\tThe little booth, yellow with fumes, appears before him again. Now it \n\tlooks like some big, empty cave. The projector is no longer there, nor \n\tthe equipment. Who knows where they junked them?! The only thing left is a clump \n\tof film strips still attached to the wall: trailers, Part One \n\tendings, etc...There he had kissed ELENA for the first time, and\n\tstrips of film like those had grazed their faces. Now they are caught up\n\tin the coils of cobwebs. And where the film-winder once stood, the\n\tnails remain with thousands of yellowing receipts. Of all the films \n\tshown at the Cinema Paradiso Palace. And three more boxfuls of \n\tthem are on the floor. \n\t\n\tAnd the windows overlooking the square are bolted shut and the glass   \n\tbroken. SALVATORE peers out of one of the cracks in the window and\n\tsees the village...which is now a city. A different world he no longer \n\tknows. \n\t\n\t105  CAFÉ IN SQUARE. INT/EXT. DAY \n\t\n\tThe cafe in the square has been completely renovated. The CASHIER and BARMEN \n\thave young, unfamiliar faces. SALVATORE holds out the receipt with a tip. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tA double whisky, please. \n\t\n\tSeveral BOYS are sitting at the comer tables, talking about girls. Others stand \n\tplaying 'war games', shake around to the obsessive strains of same electronic \n\ttune. \n\t\n\tA man comes up to SALVATORE and asks for his autograph. Then SALVATORE turns to \n\tthe plate-glass window overlooking the main street, where the workers' club once \n\twas. And like a flash, a shudder freezes him to the spot.... Two steps away \n\tfrom \n\thim, through the glass, a stunning vision, which casts him beyond time, chills \n\this blood: there before him is ELENA! But she is still young, young as she was \n\tthen! Sweet, luminous, alluring, exactly the way he saw her the first time at \n\tthe station. \n\t\n\tShe is waiting to go across the street with a bunch of books under her \n\tarm...Have the passing years had no effect on her? Or is she an hallucination? \n\tNo! It's a dream! Or is he dead too, like ALFREDO? SALVATORE doesn't know how to \n\texplain it. And he is suddenly seized by a feeling of panic. His glass drops to \n\tthe floor...As the GIRL walks off... \n\t\n\t106  GIANCALDO. STREET. EXT. DAY \n\t\n\tAt the age of fifty-five, SALVATORE feels no scruples about wandering\n\tthe streets of his home town, spying from a distance on an eighteen- year-old \n\tgirl. There's nothing he can do about it. He stares at her with the amazement of \n\tsomeone who discovers that miracles exist. Now he is nearer to her. How lovely \n\tshe is! It's her, no doubt about it! Exactly the same. Except she has a \n\tdifferent hair-do and is wearing different clothes:  ELENA didn't wear slacks. \n\tThe GIRL goes up to a parked motorcycle. She removes the padlock and fastens her \n\tbooks to the rack. SALVATORE is standing there a few steps away, and without \n\tstopping to think, moves a little closer, discreetly, politely.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tExcuse me, Miss...\n\t\t\t(She turns to look at him, \n\t\t\tindifferent, but friendly. \n\t\t\tHe looks at her wonderful \n\t\t\tblue eyes.) \n\t\tI'm so sorry, I thought you were \n\t\tsomeone else. \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tGIRL  \n\t\t\t(Shrugging) \n\t\tWell. \n\t\n\tShe has already started the motor of her bike. A flip of the accelerator and \n\toff she goes, her hair flying in the wind. \n\t\n\tSALVATORE follows her with his eyes until she disappears around the corner.\n\t\n\t107  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. AFTERNOON \n\t\n\tThe old shots of ELENA getting off the train and walking away, casting a curious \n\tlook at the camera...SALVATORE is watching her again, projected on the white \n\twall of his room. He also watches the other shots of those happy long-gone days  \n\tthe picnic,. she at the beach, smiling, joyful...And again SALVATORE doesn't \n\tunderstand, or doesn't want to understand. But these scenes could have been shot \n\tyesterday, so identical to ELENA is the girl he saw on the street...And the \n\twound which he thought had healed years ago, starts bleeding again. \n\t\n\tThe lingering note of suffering for a romance that had ended without his ever \n\tknowing why, and the endless explanations that had been sifted through by his \n\tyoung mind, start slipping through his soul again, like those shots \n\tslipping again through an old 8mm projector. \n\t\n\tThrough the crack of the door, MARIA sees those images on the wall, SALVATORE \n\trocking his head back and forth slowly, like he used to do as a boy when he \n\tcried. She somehow feels his grief, his bitterness, lowers her eyes and walks \n\taway without a word, as the little shiny rectangle on the wall remains blank, \n\tempty...And SALVATORE sits there gazing at it, as if he saw other scenes which \n\this camera never set down on film, only his memory. \n\t \n\t108  HIGH SCHOOL. STREETS AND LITTLE SQUARE. EXT. DAY \n\t\n\tThe HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS are coming out after school. Happy young faces. That \n\tGIRL 's motorcycle can be seen in a rear-view mirror. SALVATORE is at the wheel \n\tof the car ALFIO has lent him. He has obviously followed that motorcycle before. \n\tHe waits with an eagerness he thought he had long lost, a determination to \n\tunderstand, to get to the bottom of the matter, which frightens him and at the \n\tsame time overwhelms him hopelessly. \n\t\n\tAnd here she comes. She unlocks the padlock and prepares to speed off. SALVATORE \n\tstarts the motor and follows her a short distance away. The GIRL heads for the \n\tnew residential district on the outskirts. \n\t\n\t109  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. DAY \n\t\n\tMARIA is setting the table. LIA and her family are eating at her \n\thouse today. SALVATORE is sitting again, with a lighted cigarette, \n\tgazing through the window at the shrubs tossing in the wind and the \n\trolling sea. The air whistling through the cracks of the windows lends a \n\theaviness to the silence, like the troubled look on his face. MARIA glances at \n\thim. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\tWhat are you thinking, Toto? \n\t\n\tSALVATORE looks at the old woman's lovely face, a faint smile. on his lips. \n\tThere was always something like an unspoken rule between them, the rule of \n\tsilence, of unconfessed complicity. And now he feels that rule has to be broken. \n\tHe speaks quietly, as if to curb the tumult of his feelings of guilt.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tI was thinking...that we've never \n\t\ttalked, Mamma...When I was little I \n\t\tsaw you as if you were already old. \n\t\tThat's probably true with all kids...\n\t\tWho knows? \n\t\t\t(She nods, then sits down \n\t\t\tbefore him. He strokes her \n\t\t\told, skinny, heavily \n\t\t\tveined hands...) \n\t\tBut only now do I realize you were \n\t\tyoung, you were beautiful, had a \n\t\twhole life before you. But how...\n\t\t\t(Sighing) \n\t\t...how could you have lived alone \n\t\tall that time, with no one to look \n\t\tafter you? You could have \n\t\tremarried...Why not? At the time I \n\t\tprobably wouldn't have understood, \n\t\tbut I would have later...\n\t\n\tMARIA doesn't answer, but she is not troubled. An inner peace lends her a sweet, \n\tquiet expression. Then she too agrees to break the rule of silence. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\tI never had anybody. If that's what \n\t\tyou think...I didn't want anybody. I \n\t\talways remained faithful. First to \n\t\tyour father, then to you, to Lia. \n\t\t\t(With a shrug) \n\t\tThat's the way I'm made, there's \n\t\tnothing I can do about it. \n\t\t\t(Smiling) \n\t\tAnd you're like me, you're too honest \n\t\tand too attached to the things you\n\t\tlove...But I don't know if that's a \n\t\tgood thing. Faithfulness is a bad \n\t\tbusiness. If you're faithful, you're \n\t\talways alone! \n\t\t\t(SALVATORE is immersed in \n\t\t\tthe profound truth of \n\t\t\tthose words. And he says \n\t\t\tnothing. The silence is \n\t\t\tbroken by the ringing of \n\t\t\tthe phone. A menacing \n\t\t\tsound, which SALVATORE \n\t\t\tcannot bear. He knows they \n\t\t\tare calling him from Rome, \n\t\t\tgives a nervous gesture, \n\t\t\tstands up and pulls out \n\t\t\tthe plug. The silence \n\t\t\treturns, the whistling of \n\t\t\tthe wind. MARIA lowers her \n\t\t\teyes.) \n\t\tIt's my fault! It would have been \n\t\tbetter if I hadn't called you... \n\t\n\tSALVATORE sits down again, leaning closer to her. He stubs out his cigarette in \n\tthe already overflowing ashtray.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(Whispering) \n\t\tNo...It's nothing to do with you. \n\t\tIt's just that I was scared of coming \n\t\tback. Now, after all these years, I \n\t\tthought I was strong, that I had \n\t\tforgotten lots of things. Instead, I \n\t\tfind it's quite the opposite, as if I \n\t\thad never left. And yet, I look at \n\t\tLia and feel as if I didn't know her, \n\t\tand you, Mamma...I abandoned you, \n\t\tran away like a thief, thought only \n\t\tof myself, and never gave you \n\t\tan explanation...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\t\t(Interrupting him) \n\t\tAnd I never asked for one! You have \n\t\tnothing to explain. I always thought \n\t\tthat what you did was right, and that \n\t\twas that. With no beating around the \n\t\tbush...\n\t\t\t(Smiling, playing it down) \n\t\tOnly one thing made me suffer: \n\t\tbolting the door shut before going to \n\t\tbed at night...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tYou never used to do that! \n\t\n\tShe smiles like a little girl who is about to confess the fibs she has told.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\tNo, no...When you used to work at \n\t\tthe movies, I could never get to \n\t\tsleep at night until you came home. \n\t\tThen when you arrived, I pretended to \n\t\tbe asleep, but I heard all your \n\t\tmovements. Then when you fell asleep, \n\t\tI'd get up and bolt the door. Then, \n\t\twhen you left, every time I did it, I \n\t\tfelt as if I had left somebody \n\t\toutside the door, far away.... \n\t\t\t(SALVATORE listens to his \n\t\t\tMOTHER'S words, surprised \n\t\t\tand entranced by the \n\t\t\tpoetry of her way of \n\t\t\tspeaking...) \n\t\tBut you were right to leave. You \n\t\tsucceeded in doing what you wanted to \n\t\tdo...\n\t\t\t(Sighing) \n\t\tWhen I call you, a different, woman \n\t\talways answers. I pretend I know them \n\t\tso they won't have to go through the \n\t\tembarrassment of introducing \n\t\tthemselves. \n\t\t\t(Smiling) \n\t\tI'm sure they take me for a crazy old \n\t\twoman. But so far I've never heard \n\t\tone voice that really loves you...I \n\t\twould have known. And yet, I'd like \n\t\tto see you...settled down...fall in \n\t\tlove...\n\t\t\t(Gazing into his eyes) \n\t\tBut your life's there. Here there are \n\t\tnothing but ghosts, Toto! Let it go. \n\t\n\tShe has said this with a subtle allusiveness in her voice. And SALVATORE \n\trealizes she has always known everything. But he doesn't' answer her. \n\tThey look at each other a Long time without speaking. Their rule of conniving \n\tsilence has come back into play, as before, forever. It is her expression that \n\ttells him to leave, to take the plane and fly away...\n\t\n\t110  SMALL SQUARE AND HOUSE. INT/EXT. EVENING \n\t\n\tBut SALVATORE has not taken his MOTHER'S advice. Re has not left. Something \n\tholds him there still, leads him to go on looking. \n\t\n\tThe GIRL'S motorcycle is parked in the courtyard beyond the gate of a small \n\thouse. He is studying it from inside the car parked in a corner of the small \n\tsquare, near a café. Re has been there some while, but is not nervous, waits \n\tthere with determination...\n\t\n\tSeveral windows in the house are lit, but no one can be seen through \n\tthe curtains. Nothing but shadows pass by every now and then. Now the light in \n\tone of the windows goes out, and the light on the stair goes on. The front door \n\topens and the GIRL comes out with a tall, sturdy- looking, elegantly dressed \n\tGENTLEMAN around fifty. \n\t\n\tThey converse bur are too far away for their voices to be heard. SALVATORE \n\twatches them come out the gate and climb into a car. They look like father and \n\tdaughter. The car now drives off and passes right by him. A gleam of light, \n\tthe reflection from the headlights, falls on the GENTLEMAN'S face. He recognizes \n\thim at once, from the birthmark on his temple...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(To himself) \n\t\tBoccia! \n\t\n\tHis eyes flash, he's afraid he's understood. And now the craze to get to the \n\tbottom of it all gnaws away at him. There is no turning back. \n\t\n\t111 CAFÉ. AND SMALL SQUARE. INT/EXT. EVENING \n\t\n\tSALVATORE'S hands rifle through a phone directory. He is in the cafe, on the \n\tother side of the glass door leading to the little square. His finger \n\truns down the column of names...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\t\t(Mumbling) \n\t\tHis last name was Lo Meo, Vincenzo. \n\t\n\tHe has already put the token into the slot and dials the number, looking at the \n\ttwo lit upstairs windows of that house, where the mystery of his life may be \n\thiding. SALVATORE hears the first ring, his heart in his throat...A shadow \n\tappears in one of the windows. And a voice answers. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tVOICE ON TELEPHONE  \n\t\tHello? \n\t\t\t(It's a woman's voice. \n\t\t\tSALVATORE shuts his eyes, \n\t\t\tis about to speak, but the \n\t\t\tlump in his throat \n\t\t\tsilences him...) \n\t\n\t\t\t\tVOICE ON TELEPHONE  \n\t\tHello? Hello? \n\t\n\tHe still hesitates, can' t get a word out, as if he had lost his voice or \n\tdidn't know what to say. He hangs up. The shadow at the window also hangs up, \n\tthen disappears... \n\t\n\tSALVATORE is at a loss, sits down at one of the rabies near the \n\tphone in the almost empty cafe. At the far end, a group of five people watching \n\ttelevision.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tBARMAN  \n\t\tYou want something? \n\t\n\tAnd he turns back to the television. SALVATORE lights a cigarette. He is \n\tuncertain. Once again he has to lake an important decision  redial the number \n\tand seek a face behind that shadow? Or forget the whole thing, the GIRL, BOCCIA, \n\tthe shadow, and go away? Yes, best go away. He gets up and leaves. He can be \n\tseen through the window turning the comer. A pack of cigarettes and a lighter \n\tlie on the table, he has forgotten them. And the lighted cigarette bums down in \n\tthe ashtray. A few moments have gone by. Footsteps, and a hand picks up the \n\tlighter and the cigarettes. It is SALVATORE who now, on a sudden urge, slips \n\tanother token into the slot. The shadow reappears at the window. The same voice \n\tas before.\n\t \n\t\t\t\tVOICE ON TELEPHONE  \n\t\tHello, who's speaking? \n\t\n\tSALVATORE answers at last, keeping his eyes shut, whispering:\n\t \n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tI'd like to speak to Signora Elena...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tVOICE ON TELEPHONE  \n\t\tSpeaking. Who is it, please? \n\t\n\tSALVATORE feels a terrible pang, continues:\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tSalvatore. \n\t\n\tSilence, charged with tension. Then the voice continues weakly, as if puzzled.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tVOICE ON TELEPHONE  \n\t\tSalvatore...who? \n\t\n\tHe runs his hand over his forehead, his eyes, as if to soothe the turmoil he \n\tfeels inside.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE \n\t\tDi Vita. Salvatore Di Vita. Do you \n\t\tremember? \n\t\t\t(Another pause chilly, \n\t\t\theavy. SALVATORE opens his \n\t\t\teyes, looks at the window. \n\t\t\tHer shadow is motionless, \n\t\t\tas if cut out of \n\t\t\tcardboard.) \n\t\tElena, I'm here, in the bar, across \n\t\tthe street from your house. \n\t\n\tThe shadow moves slowly, a hand pulls aside the curtain. It's a moment of heart-\n\trending emotion...She appears. And they see each other from a distance, after \n\tthirty years, each of them with a phone receiver to their ear. But she is \n\tsomewhat in the dark, against the light, it's impossible to make out her \n\tfeatures. Her voice gives a sudden start, instantly controlled.\n\t \n\t\t\t\tVOICE ON TELEPHONE  \n\t\tCertainly, I remember...\n\t\n\tSALVATORE'S eyes glisten, try to pierce the distance and the darkness to get a \n\tbetter look, but in vain. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tElena. I'd like to see you...Let's \n\t\tmeet. \n\t\n\tELENA lets the curtain drop and goes back to being a shadow. She whispers the \n\twords.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tVOICE ON TELEPHONE  \n\t\tIt's been so long. Why should we \n\t\tmeet? What good would it do? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE \n\t\tPlease, don't say no.. . \n\t\n\tBut her voice is firm, unshakeable, even if quivering with emotion.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tVOICE ON TELEPHONE  \n\t\tI'm old, Salvatore. And you too. It's \n\t\tbest not to meet. Goodbye. \n\t\n\tThe shadow hangs up, disappears. The light goes off.\n\t\n\t112  DIFFERENT SETTINGS. INT/EXT. EVENING \n\t\n\tThe wind is stronger now, the streets and the square are empty. SALVATORE \n\tis at the wheel of the car, driving aimlessly around the town. He has \n\trediscovered the woman who conditioned his whole life and they hadn't had the \n\tcourage to meet. An obsessive musical heat, fraught with rage, pours out of the \n\tcar radio. \n\t\n\t113  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. EVENING \n\t\n\tA phone ringing drowns out the sound of the television and the wind  \n\twhistling outside. In the half-darkened room, MARIA picks up the receiver...  \n\t\n\t\t\t\tMARIA  \n\t\tHello?\n\t\n\tNo one answers, but she can sense the presence of someone who now hangs up. \n\tMARIA is alarmed. Who could it be at this hour? And where is Toto?\n\t\n\t114  SEAFRONT AND PIER. EXT/INT. CAR. EVENING \n\t\n\tSALVATORE stands motionless on the pier, facing the storm-tossed sea. He feels \n\trelieved by the roar of the waves that dispels his bitter thoughts, blurs them, \n\tbut does not wipe out the look of suffering in his eyes. A flashing light seems \n\tto approach behind his back. SALVATORE turns and is blinded by the headlights of \n\ta car parked at the beginning of the pier. The splattering waves lend the scene \n\ta hazy cast and diffuse the glare of the flashing headlights. Now the lights \n\tmove towards him. And SALVATORE also lakes a few timid steps forward... \n\tThey are close. The car has almost stopped. But it is impossible to make out the \n\tperson at the wheel who now reaches over to open the other door. A voice can be \n\tbarely heard over the raging sea. It is ELENA's voice. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tSalvatore! \n\t\n\tSALVATORE approaches, accepting the invitation, enters the car and shuts the \n\tdoor. The headlights go off and the car remains there suspended between the open \n\tsea and the harbor with its rocking boats. Inside the car, not a word. Two dark \n\tfigures gaze at each other, unintelligible, as if the night were trying to \n\tfurther delay that meeting. The glowing reflection of a wave higher than the \n\tothers now lights up their faces. ELENA was right, they are no longer the faces \n\tof teenagers, but of people on in years who study each other, searching for a \n\ttruth. The howling of the wind and the crashing of the waves are louder, but \n\tELENA and SALVATORE /rear nothing, sit glued to their seats, fixed in the \n\tendless gaze that envelops them. He is the first to break the silence in a faint  \n\tvoice.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tHow'd you know I'd be here? \n\t\n\tELENA  I don't know how many years have gone by, but some things about you I do \n\tremember. There weren't many, places you could have gone. I looked around...\n\t\n\tSALVATORE turns on the light of the rear-view mirror. Finally \n\tthey can see better. They look at each other a little ill at ease, \n\tmaking the inevitable comparisons with the memory of their young faces. \n\tSALVATORE carefully observes her graying hair, her blue eyes lined \n\twith wrinkles, the somewhat faded beauty mark on her lip.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tYou're still beautiful...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tDon't be silly...I'm old.\n\t\t\t(She looks down troubled \n\t\t\tby the way he has of \n\t\t\tgazing into her eyes, \n\t\t\tspeaks almost mumbling her \n\t\t\twords.) \n\t\tDon't look at me like that, please. \n\t\t\t(And she switches off the \n\t\t\tlight. But this time it is \n\t\t\tless dark, things can be \n\t\t\tseen.) \n\t\tWhy'd you come back? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tAlfredo died. Do you remember him? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tOf course I remember him. I'm sorry. \n\t\tYou were terribly fond of him. \n\t\n\tA moment of silence. It's hard to find something to say.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tI saw your daughter. She's beautiful! \n\t\tWho knows how many Salvatores \n\t\tmust be running after her...\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\t\t(Smiling) \n\t\tOne or two. Bur there're not all that \n\t\tmany Salvatores. \n\t\t\t(SALVATORE also smiles, \n\t\t\tbut a puzzled smile as if \n\t\t\twhat she has said had \n\t\t\tthrown him off-guard.) \n\t\tI've got a son, too...he's older. \n\t\tAnd you, do you have children? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tNo. And I'm not married. \n\t\t\t(ELENA sits there in \n\t\t\tsilence. A veil of sadness \n\t\t\tclouds her eyes. \n\t\t\tSALVATORE'S \n\t\t\ttoo...) \n\t\tAre you happy? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tAll things considered, yes. Even if \n\t\tit wasn't what I dreamt of then...\n\t\n\tAgain SALVATORE is thrown off-guard, as if the round key of \n\this enquiry had met with only square locks. She continues.\n\t \n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tMy husband...you know him. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tSure, sure! Boccia...\n\t\t\t(With a bitter smile) \n\t\tWhat's he do? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tPolitics. He's the district \n\t\trepresentative. We met at the \n\t\tUniversity in Pisa. \n\t\n\tThen instinctively, in a shy voice, SALVATORE asks the question \n\tthat he probably wouldn't have asked a moment later.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tAnd...how come you never married \n\t\tthat guy from Tuscany? \n\t\n\tThe white foam of the waves splashes up over the wall of the pier, dashing \n\tagainst the car windows. The shadow of the trickling water is superimposed on \n\tthe agony of their faces. ELENA hides her embarrassment beneath a faint but \n\thaughty smile.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tI didn't want to...I had to fight \n\t\ttooth and nail. But in the end I \n\t\twon...\n\t\t\t(SALVATORE is unable to \n\t\t\tsmile. It's as if the void \n\t\t\twere growing and swelling \n\t\t\twithin. Thunder and \n\t\t\tlightning shatter the \n\t\t\troaring of the wind and \n\t\t\tsea, hut it does not rain. \n\t\t\tNow her smile Jades away.)\n\t\tAt that time...I was waiting for \n\t\tyou...\n\t\n\tThere is no resentment in her words. She has said them fondly. With the serenity \n\tof someone who has suffered greatly and then found a strong convincing way of \n\tsuffering no more. For SALVATORE, it's as if one of those thunderbolts had \n\tpierced his heart. He leans over, gazing into her shining eyes. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tBut I've never forgotten you, Elena! \n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\t\t(Whispering) \n\t\tNor have I. Even though you \n\t\tdisappeared...\n\t\t\t(SALVATORE is staggered, \n\t\t\tfeels as if he were \n\t\t\tplunging into the void. \n\t\t\tWhat she has said strikes \n\t\t\thim as grotesque. ELENA \n\t\t\tstrokes his hair, as if to \n\t\t\trestrain his sinking \n\t\t\theart, gives a sweet \n\t\t\tsmile.) \n\t\tBut what's the point of talking about \n\t\tit? We risk being pathetic and \n\t\tridiculous. \n\t\t\t(And she tries to change \n\t\t\tthe subject.) \n\t\tYou still live in Rome? \n\t\n\tBut SALVATORE ignores the question. He doesn't want to change the subject. \n\tHe feels that everything is crumbling inside him, the alibis and excuses he had \n\thad to give himself in order to accept the end of their romance. And instead, \n\tnow the tables seem to have completely turned. Without realizing, he shouts \n\tdesperately, staring wildly at her and shaking her by the \n\tshoulders.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tWhat do you mean, you were waiting \n\t\tfor me?! What are you saying? \n\t\t\t(He controls himself at \n\t\t\tonce, continues, breathing \n\t\t\theavily.) \n\t\tThe last time we saw each other, we \n\t\tmade a date to meet at the Cinema \n\t\tParadiso. You remember? And you \n\t\tdidn't come, you disappeared without \n\t\tleaving a trace, nothing! I'll tell \n\t\tyou how many years have gone by: more \n\t\tthan thirty!!! \n\t\n\tQuiet rears stream down Elena's face, glisten with the reflections of the \n\tlightning and the waves.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tI kept that date. \n\t\t\t(SALVATORE laughs at the \n\t\t\tabsurdity of it. A \n\t\t\tnervous, heartbroken \n\t\t\tlaugh, which slowly melts \n\t\t\taway as she goes on to \n\t\t\tsay:) \n\t\tBut I was late...\n\t\t\t(Tears continue to stream \n\t\t\tout of her blue eyes, but \n\t\t\tshe tells her story in a \n\t\t\tcalm voice.) \n\t\tI had a fight with my family. I tried \n\t\tto convince them again that they \n\t\tcouldn't separate us. But it was \n\t\tfutile. They had decided to leave \n\t\tSicily once and for all. Which is \n\t\twhat we did. I didn't know what to do \n\t\tany more, what to say. And I said \n\t\tyes, I'd do whatever they wanted. In \n\t\treturn, my father promised to let me \n\t\tsee you one last time, to say \n\t\tgoodbye. But I hoped that by seeing \n\t\teach other we could take advantage of \n\t\tit and make a decision...I thought \n\t\twe would run away together. \n\t\t\t(She holds back her sobs. \n\t\t\tDries her tears with the \n\t\t\tback of her hand, and \n\t\t\tcontinues:) \n\t\tMy father drove me to the movie \n\t\ttheatre.

She heaves a Jeep sigh. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tBut you disappeared all the same. \n\t\n\tThere is a haunted look in SALVATORE's eyes, he is searching his memory for \n\tsomething he can't find, then suddenly sees, as if in a dream...his hand thirty \n\tyears before going through the routine gesture of hanging a receipt on the nail, \n\tover the others, mechanically, without even looking...and he shuts his eyes as \n\tif fearing the truth. Her last words have wounded him. He shakes his head, then \n\tin a faint voice:\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tOh, how I looked for you, Elena! \n\t\tYou'll never know. I wrote, \n\t\ttelephoned, nothing. Nobody ever \n\t\tanswered. But I dreamt of you for \n\t\tyears! That's why I went away...and \n\t\tnever came back here. \n\t\t\t(And his anguish breaks \n\t\t\tfree, dissolving into \n\t\t\tquiet, almost childish \n\t\t\ttears.

They embrace \n\t\t\tand remain like that, she \n\t\t\twith her face buried in \n\t\t\this shoulder, he leaning \n\t\t\ton hers with his tear-\n\t\t\tfilled eyes.)\n\t\tEven as the years passed, in all the \n\t\twomen I met, I was only looking for \n\t\tyou. I had success it's true, but \n\t\tthere was always something missing...\n\t\t\t(She is deeply moved, goes \n\t\t\ton caressing him gently \n\t\t\tuntil he calms down. The \n\t\t\tcar windows are steamed \n\t\t\tup. The sea, the harbor, \n\t\t\tthe waves have \t\n\t\t\tdisappeared. Nothing \n\t\t\tremains but the sound of  \n\t\t\tthe storm.

A crazy lunatic!  \n\t\t\t(She gives a faint smile.) \n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tHe wasn't crazy. In the beginning I \n\t\twas upset. I think I really hated \n\t\thim. But then, with time, I \n\t\tunderstood what he said...and your \n\t\tsilence too. \n\t\n\tSALVATORE whispers one last dreadful revelation. And it's as if he had got a \n\tterrible weight off his chest.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tBut I never saw that note! \n\t\t\t(He squints, as if to \n\t\t\tstress the absurdity of \n\t\t\tthe idea.) \n\t\tI must have covered it with my hand, \n\t\twithout realizing it, that's the only \n\t\texplanation...\n\t\t\t(But strangely enough, \n\t\t\tELENA is not surprised.) \n\t\n\t\t\t\tELENA  \n\t\tWhat difference does it make to find \n\t\tan explanation? That's the way it \n\t\twent. But Alfredo didn't betray you, \n\t\the was the only one who really \n\t\tunderstood you. Salvatore, if you had \n\t\tchosen to be with me, you'd have \n\t\tnever made your films. And that would \n\t\thave been a pity!

They kiss with heartrending tenderness, with the same \n\tpassion of their first kiss amidst the strips of film brushing their faces, so \n\tmany years ago. And they make love, clasped in the cramped quarters of the car, \n\tlike two teenagers. Passionate kisses, embraces, deep sighs. Their hair \n\tdamp with sweat, their hands clasping, their fingers interweaving. Then the \n\tfrenzy subsides into a deep, tumultuous pleasure, of immense loving and immense \n\tgrief...As outside the wind and the waves go on rating around that car which \n\tseems suspended in empty space.) \n\t\n\t \n\t119  ALFREDO'S WIDOW'S HOUSE.

He has finished the cup of coffee SIGNORA \n\tANNA has prepared for him. He picks up the stool, recognizes it at once: it's \n\tthe one ALFREDO had made for him as a little boy so he could climb up and put \n\tthe reels on the projector. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tANNA  \n\t\tWhen they showed your films on \n\t\ttelevision, he was happy. He'd plop \n\t\thimself down there and all his \n\t\tailments were forgotten. He knew all \n\t\tthe words by heart, every one, and \n\t\tI'd describe what was going on. And \n\t\twhen the papers talked about \n\t\tyou, I had to read them two or three \n\t\ttimes...\n\t\n\tSALVATORE examines the can, wonders what it can be. He opens it: inside is a \n\treel of film, wrapped in a plastic bag, well preserved. Those objects bring a \n\tpang to his heart, and the things that ANNA said, but he feels disappointed, as \n\tif he expected to find something else.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tDid he ever think of meeting me? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tANNA  \n\t\tNo, never! One time your mother said \n\t\tthat if he wanted, you'd have surely \n\t\tcome. He got furious and said  'No, \n\t\tToto mustn't come back to Giancaldo, \n\t\tnever!!' He didn't say it to be mean. \n\t\tHe was a decent man. Who knows what \n\t\the could have been thinking? Towards \n\t\tthe end he'd say such strange things. \n\t\tAnd a moment before he shut his eyes, \n\t\the told your mother not to let you \n\t\tknow. \n\t\n\t120  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY \n\t\n\tA cloud of yellowed scraps of paper flutters into the air and as it falls slowly \n\tto the ground another handful is flung up. SALVATORE is in the projection booth, \n\tlooking through the countless yellowed receipts, stuffed away in boxes. He looks \n\tat them one by one, then throws them into the air. A desperate search, almost a \n\tdefiance of the passing of time. He continues with greater determination, flings \n\tpiles of receipts into the air, glances at a few dates, a film title, tries to \n\tdiscover the oldest dates at the bottom. He moves swiftly, his hands plunge in, \n\tthen fling up a nimbus of paper and dust. But to no avail...He stops, short of \n\tbreath. His eyes go over to the nails in the wall, where other stacks of \n\treceipts are hanging. He gets up and goes to look at them, thumbs \" it through \n\tthem hastily, in anger... \n\t\n\tHe yanks off two or three packs, which come off, nail and all. Only then does he \n\tnotice that at the bottom of those blocks of yellowed paper, there are same more \n\tsheets, much older, almost brown. His eyes concentrate on the mildewed scraps of \n\tpaper. He leans over, picks themup and goes through them one by one, delicately, \n\tbecause they crumble in his fingers...And then all of a sudden, some film \n\ttitles \n\the recognizes from that time. He goes on thumbing through them, and all at once \n\tan astonished look appears on his face  in his hands is a receipt that has been \n\tturned over. It's the one! The message scribbled on it can still be seen. He \n\treads it. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE'S VOICE  \n\t\t\t(Off-screen) \n\t\tSalvatore, forgive me. I'll explain \n\t\tlater what happened.

A group \n\tof youngsters scream, amused and excited. Among them, ELENA'S DAUGHTER, \n\tsmiling... SALVATORE sees her joking with friends and pointing to some boys  \n\tchasing the mice across the square, hooting and laughing. As a white-haired OLD \n\tTRAMP, filthy and covered in rags, makes his way through the crowd.

Congratulations on your film. \n\t\tIt's terrific. \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tThanks. \n\t\n\tA COLLEAGUE of SALVATORE comes up behind him.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tWell? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tCOLLEAGUE  \n\t\tThe distributor is opening up the \n\t\tfilm earlier. The press conference is \n\t\tin the afternoon. The actors will \n\t\talso be there, the producer, just \n\t\tabout everyone. \n\t\n\tAn ASSISTANT comes up to them.\n\t\n\t\t\t\tASSISTANT  \n\t\tThe official notification of the \n\t\taward just came out, but we've \n\t\talready received a mountain of \n\t\ttelegrams. Aren't you happy? \n\t\n\t\t\t\tSALVATORE  \n\t\tIt's all right. We'll talk about it \n\t\tlater. \n\t\n\tSALVATORE walks off towards the viewing theatre. \n\t\n\tSALVATORE is by himself in the small viewing theatre. Now the lights go down. \n\tThe beam of light shines out of the little square hole of the projection booth \n\tand the screen lights up. A number trailer goes by and then SALVATORE sees the \n\tfirst shots. \n\t\n\tA start of intense amazement and joy suddenly runs through him, astounds him, \n\tdelights him. It's the best piece of film he has ever seen...  \n\t\n\tIt consists of all the kisses ALFREDO cut out of the films and kept for him, \n\twhen he was a little boy. They have been spliced together, one , after the \n\tother, at random, same of them even upside down. And yet it looks like a first-\n\trate editing job. \n\t\n\tIn rapid sequence the passionate kisses between actors and actresses, names \n\tfamous and names unknown in the history of movies. Greta Garbo, Gary Cooper, \n\tAlida Valii, Rudolph Valentino, Ingrid Bergman, Clark Gable, Anna Magnani, \n\tHumphrey Bogart, Marlene Dietrich, Amedeo Nazzari, Luisa Ferida, Vittorio De \n\tSica, Rita Hayworth, Tyrone Power, Doris Durante, Massimo Gironi, Marta Abba, \n\tFred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Assia Noris...\n\t\n\tA whole movie season summed up in a few fragments, a few seconds. A bizarre, \n\tpoignant, melancholy parade. \n\t\n\tSALVATORE is overwhelmed, moved to tears. It is the most profound act of love he \n\thas ever seen. He laughs as tears shine in his eyes. Up on the screen, another \n\tkiss, the last kiss marking the happy ending of a film. And the age-old words \n\tappear 'THE END'.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCinema Paradiso\nWriters :   Giuseppe Tornatore\nGenres :   Drama  Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n"
